  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elira's final statement "I found them here, in the dust" crystallizes her transformed understanding with professional cost visible. The piece teaches its pattern early (dust as lens for reality) and pays it off through the logarithmic spiral discovery that mirrors her neutron star models.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with frost patterns building toward the revelation that the ledger recorded escapes, not commerce—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights all prior material. The cost is visible in her transformation from artist to gift-giver, forsaking commerce for healing. Orientation anchors (canyon, post-fire, glass artist) establish clearly within the first paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's transformed perception ("She didn't need ears anymore. Her skin heard.") reweights the entire premise with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through thermal mapping patterns. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the post-collapse world state.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the library transforms from "mausoleum of knowledge" to "cathedral of quiet endings" with visible cost (the undertaker's permanent commitment to the depths). The lens broadcasting pattern teaches itself early and pays off through accumulated soul releases. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the underwater setting.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching (nightly runs, anonymous gifts) that deepens through community adoption of the practice. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the bell transforms from silent promise to voiced declaration with clear cost (sanctions persist, resources thin). The "passed into other hands" ending crystallizes Charged Poise with options legible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the revelation that "unused love was not stored; it was sung"—a conceptual repricing that reweights the entire quest. The accumulative structure builds through breath rhythms (7/11 counting, matching the pilgrim's breath) toward this crystallized understanding. Cost is felt in the permeation of mist that requires "surrender" and transforms the artist's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elira discovers time's texture through sacrifice (photographs disintegrating). The halo fragment as "wound" reframes the entire garden project with visible cost. Slight deduction for the middle section's density that momentarily obscures the causal chain between fragment contact and photograph dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with seeds as the dominant through-line, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where scattered seeds promise transformation against the falling wall. The piano key cipher provides solid causality for vault access. Cost is visible in her chains, the weight of seeds "heavier than any iron," and the stakes of tomorrow's wall demolition.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught synesthesia and absence-forging that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she creates the memory-catcher. The closure lands with felt cost ("weary but unbroken") and the final image of her departing with purpose reweights the opening quest. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (greenhouse location clarified gradually) and some causality opacity around the forge mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the thief's role crystallizes as translator rather than thief, with felt cost in her invisibility and the emotional weight of reunions she facilitates. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building pattern density through flower codes and moonbeam revelations. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the piece teaches its lyrical mode early.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens with density increasing through ritual narration and glass-sphere placement, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the abandoned vessels become sanctuaries. The cost is legible in her leaving without witnessing results—a genuine sacrifice of control. Orientation anchors cleanly (glassblower, control room, post-Frost thaw). The child finding the sphere provides closure that reweights the entire ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the burning of evidence that transforms betrayal into liberation, with visible cost in the protagonist's trembling certainty becoming "forged in betrayal, baptized in trembling certainty." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer (shell whispers, cast notes, film burning) toward density shift at closure. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality opacity around how the shell's supernatural guidance functions within the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as density increases through catalogued silences, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she enters the territory she's charted. Who/where/when anchored early (ridge fort, storm, last star). Cost is legible in her transformation from observer to participant, though the precise mechanism of "mapping silence" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with loops building toward the realization that thoughts arise from "being witnessed" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost (the violin melts, purpose fulfilled). The recursive timeline mechanic is well-integrated and pays off causally. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the middle sections that momentarily dulls pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through collective harmony emerging from silent vulnerability, with the lens cracking upon "completion" marking transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from individual isolation to communal humming, with mistrust thawing through exposure rather than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fireflies mirror her marble spirals and the vine curls around her ankle—the garden's consent made visible. The accumulative structure coheres through marble-memory-reciprocity linkage. Cost appears in her isolation from the algorithmic world and physical toll ("rose stiffly"), though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elira's discovery that "time doesn't flow here—it folded" fundamentally reweights the station's purpose and the xenomorphs' behavior. The lever pull creates a decisive turn that reveals lateral time, with cost visible in the terror of the adjacent self and the lingering "scent of ozone and cinnamon" marking permanent change. Who/where/when anchored within first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the ghost's dissolution and the opera house's transformation from "hollow" to "humming, alive." The accumulative structure builds through water imagery, ghostly emergence, and synchronized movement to a clear closure where silence itself becomes song. Minor orientation delay (musician's identity emerges gradually) works thematically but slightly softens early grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elira's acceptance of fault-tolerance—carrying error as part of function—with visible cost in her physical state and the pinned illustration. The accumulative structure builds coherently from fever break through oracle consultation to the external gesture with the orchid, though the conceptual weight of "swallowed truth" could be more concretely anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the shift from "ghost shift" as spectral labor to mental machinery grinding backward through guilt. The revelation that she planted the valve wheel herself while drunk creates genuine cost—she must own her father's legacy without supernatural buffer. Minor orientation delay (tunnel location unclear until ~150 words) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the keeper's transformation into a witness who releases rather than records, accepting impermanence as "the rarest form of love." The origami swan mechanism provides causal linkage between physical and metaphysical realms. Minor orientation debt for the river's sudden appearance at line 8.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the eclipse serving as a catalytic event that crystallizes Elara's mission. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the hair curl passes to the girl with the whispered vow "I want to keep this feeling," showing wonder transferred across generations with visible cost (letting go of the keepsake). Causality weakens slightly in the middle where coincidence (the unplanned eclipse) drives the major turn rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the historian commits to "weave with testimony." The displaced axis concept effectively constrains the world and drives discovery. Deduction for slightly abstract cost—while the commitment to descend and weave is clear, the price remains more conceptual than visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with pattern-taught fortune-cookie prophecies building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts the analyst as partner, crystallizing his role as "conductor." The cost is legible in Elias's shift from solitary oracle to collaborative architect. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, island, Elias's role) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure through Conceptual Repricing—the possession disperses into the very stillness it sought to dominate, with visible cost in the chamber's transformation. The rhetorical excavation builds density through layered questions that reweight the possession's nature. Early orientation anchors the dimensional anchor setting and priest's mission by ~100 words. The cost is legible when the possession unravels into dispersal rather than destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memories building to the symphonic crescendo. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she "remembered how to try," with visible cost in the exhaustion rule and the glass spire's vibration. The orientation anchors (glass spire, frozen lake, fortune cookie writer) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when echo-selves merge and the tablet blooms, reweighting the journey from escape to integration. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through recursive corridors and confession sequences, with cost visible in "cracks spiderwebbing through its glowing surface." Orientation anchors solidly (gravity defier, viaduct, tablet) though the precise nature of "procedural generation" remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the broken needle transforming from "useless" to "catalyst," and the filament of hush evolving from fragile to "resilient, radiant." The backward music creates a decisive turn that reweights the entire teaching practice. Cost is visible in the students' raw responses and Elara's risk of losing her thread.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise - Elias crystallizes his stance and commits to investigation with visible stakes (quarantine zones, disappeared colleagues). The causal chain holds: message discovery → realization of Bureau corruption → lateral investigation decision. Cost is implied through the danger ahead rather than fully paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the UV-revealed memory glyphs building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as memory broker. The cost is visible in seventeen years of sealed grief now opened. Slight deduction for the orientation arriving late (greenhouse location not fully anchored until several paragraphs in).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from personal meditation to communal transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the village literally weaves the rope into bridges, with visible cost in their tears of recognition. The pattern of "impossible choices as false binaries" holds throughout, though the energy beings' role remains somewhat ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the child's emergence and petal offering crystallizes Lira's work's value with visible cost (the burned world, the losses memorialized). The pattern of musical unbinding accumulates through specific played stories until the greenhouse itself responds, teaching its logic early and paying off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vael's transformation completes with visible cost (destroying her livelihood) and the grotto's amber seal confirms her vow. The accumulative build through sensory layering (static, petal, memories) coheres under the Hybrid lens. Slight deduction because the cost, while clear, could be more viscerally felt in the moment of destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the harbor transforms into a space of reciprocal recognition, with visible cost in Elias's shift from profit to purpose. The accumulative structure coheres well through the envelope-cycle pattern. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the inciting envelope discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira becomes "the grafting point, the place where loneliness learned to bloom," with visible cost in her transformation from individual artist to communal anchor. The accumulative structure coheres through reed-weaving imagery, though the arbor-as-loom revelation feels slightly rushed for the weight it carries.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the illustrator's work transforms potential echoes into real birdsong, with cost paid through the pendant's searing heat and borrowed time from the giant's dreams. The orientation anchors solidly (rooftop canals, sleeping giant, natural history illustrator), and causality holds as each discovery builds toward the chamber of unborn sound.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where silence transforms from emptiness to resonance/frequency, with visible cost in the separation's new theorem. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how the glass eyes project the equation—the lunar angle mechanism feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the dweller reading the notice and choosing future visibility through "resonance" rather than spectacle, with felt emotional cost evident in her tears. The accumulative pattern of found objects building toward connection is well-established. Slight deduction for the power outage setup that doesn't fully integrate with the closure's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist releases control and transforms from owner to participant, with visible cost (torn journal pages, abandoned scientific method). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around the metamorphosis concept ("reluctant in her").

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught rain trails leading to discoveries that reweight meaning. The exchange ritual creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (giving up her best work and favorite brush for sleep). The amber-to-seaglass transformation and "changed hands" creates clear before/after. Slight deduction for cost appearing mainly in gesture rather than felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clairvoyant understands the forces were always part of the magic. The forgotten memory reveal provides causal grounding. Slight weakness in cost legibility - the emotional price of this recognition could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered discoveries (widow's melody, shipwright's chime, offerings) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the town adopts a ritual of naming. The closure lands with felt cost: "The absences did not vanish; they became acknowledged, woven into the rhythm of waves and wind." The persistent constraint of working with fragments and voids shapes Elira's methods throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira absorbs the chorus of truths and emerges "remade." Cost is visible (punch dissolves, self unravels) though the conceptual nature of the "fortress" being a chorus rather than place slightly dulls the physical stakes. Orientation anchors clearly (Elira, vault, midnight hour).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira achieves Earned Stasis—she doesn't solve the tile's mystery but creates the score for future wanderers, with visible cost in her choice to leave understanding incomplete. The accumulative structure coheres as memories layer into the "unheard symphony." Slight dock for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when/where.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through magnetic crescendo to spatial mutiny to the final plain of goodbyes. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the immortal achieves wonder through "the quiet thunder of endings" with his sanctuary's destruction as visible cost. Orientation anchors (immortal, prismatic escondite, fragment) establish by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the child's transformation from thief to "architect" with visible cost in vulnerability and participation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of distributed fairness. Orientation anchors clearly (funeral home, midnight, child with ink pot) and causality tracks cleanly. The cost could be more visceral at the final beat—the "mathematics of fair trade" as "practice/presence" feels conceptually valid but emotionally distant.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—the stationer crystallizes her understanding that the mountain is a "chorus" and leaves her notepad as invitation, with cost visible in her acceptance of shared creative space. The accumulative structure coheres as density increases from personal invention to discovered collaboration to offered participation. However, the orientation (who/where/when) takes too long to clarify fully, creating early drag.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure through Charged Poise—Elias commits to endless collection "Until the tide took him—or until the world admitted he'd never died at all," with visible cost in his isolation and bureaucratic erasure. The accumulative structure coheres well as fragments layer into meaning. The orientation anchors (port, containers, Elias's status) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: the myth buster releases her obsessive quest, accepting riddles "to live beside, not solve." The accumulative structure coheres as each ritual layer (shell whispers, cello hums, compass spins) builds toward the revelation that silence itself is what she's buried. Cost is visible in the shattering of her tools and the acceptance of permanent loss.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final compass image crystallizes options with "postponed" rather than defeated privatization showing visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as graffiti messages build community resistance through pattern and density. Minor deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the raft city's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the 05:00 grain fall creating Resonant Reconfiguration—the inspector's vigil transforms from documentation to communion with clear emotional cost ("throat tight"). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. The closure lands as Earned Stasis: accepting the message will remain unheard while bearing witness anyway, with palpable melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elara completes the repair and immediately turns to the next broken thing, showing her endless cycle with visible cost ("grieving widow" waiting). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and repair process build toward the drone's resurrection. Deduction for slight orientation delay (blindness revealed late in first paragraph) and some causality softness in how the water refraction method actually fixes the drone.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where condensation patterns lead to the discovery of the convergence point beneath the ice, with the narrator shifting from "editing" to "witnessing." The cost is felt in the transformation from "worrying tranquility" to deeper satisfaction, though the physical stakes could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the town's revival via accumulated rhythm, with clear cost in the bell tuner's departure and the "wild hush" that remains. The accumulative structure coheres—each footstep builds toward the fountain scene where she deposits the fork. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Elira's death-as-vessel transformation, with clear cost (her life) paid on-page. The accumulative structure builds density through sensory layers (kelp/temple/memories) toward the final symphonic release. Orientation anchors cleanly (underwater temple, Elira as sonic archaeologist, oxygen running low). Minor dock for the slightly abstract "to become its vessel" insight that could use more embodied grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the lattice transforms the lighthouse beam into a permanent carrier of suppressed truths, with clear cost ("spent," "slumped"). The accumulative lens holds as whispers gather into luminous truth. Minor orientation gap: the specific nature of "the bodies" remains vague, slightly weakening causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost bride's essence infuses into the orchard, transforming haunting into heritage with visible cost (her dissolution) and gain (fruit bearing). The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift when twilight fruit appears. Slight deduction for the midpoint having less causal linkage between Elara's recognition and the greenhouse's awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the sewing sequence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the plate transforms and the canyon walls reveal ghostly tapestries. Cost is visible in the needle-scars and the generational pattern of failed attempts. The closure lands with the weaver's ongoing commitment ("She would return tomorrow") showing Earned Stasis. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where anchors drift early) and some abstract phrasing around the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the sundial's restoration enables communal faith renewal. The cost is visible in Elara's permanent rootedness ("She never left"). Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and the convenience of the villagers' arrival timing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the final image of chalk messages awaiting resurrection. However, no decisive change occurs—the protagonist simply completes another encoding task without visible cost or transformation. The ending achieves Charged Poise at best, crystallizing her belief system, but the "carefully inventive hope" lacks the on-page cost required for true closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where her intervention saves the prince and transforms the observatory's purpose. The eternal flame's resonance with adjacent possibilities provides a persistent constraint that shapes her tactics throughout. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the risk she takes, though the final transformation could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the dissolution of letters and emergence of new path, with visible cost in the memories traded for healing. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual progression, though the "evoke" concept could sharpen earlier to strengthen causality. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered imagery (coral/cast/scribbles) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira transforms from grief to kinship. The orientation anchors (anesthetic/atrium/twilight) establish liminal space by ~60 words, and closure lands with felt cost ("lotus-hearted ache... kinship"). Minor deduction for slight abstraction in final paragraphs ("symbiosis" feels elevated beyond POV).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through oral histories, light-bending setup, and communal response, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira pockets the fragment as "no longer a relic, but a key." Cost is felt through her realization that she'd "buried [delight] beneath technique, acclaim, and the pressure to be 'significant'" though the exact price of this shift could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elira literally absorbs the mural's frequencies, transforming from restorer to vessel. The cost is legible (loss of fixed identity, dissolution of professional certainty) though the middle section could tighten the discovery sequence for stronger causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the garden of resistance crystallizing options and the children singing old lullabies showing undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of collective defiance. Deduction for mild orientation delay (greenhouse purpose unclear initially) and some causality softness in how surveillance is evaded.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the galaxy postcard's warming and new text providing the decisive deepening that triggers her shift from lullaby to psalm. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through "something like rest—not in her bones, but in the spaces between her words," showing Earned Stasis with visible cost. Orientation anchors clearly (poet, shell, post-war), though the transition from war memories to present could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the caretaker's acceptance that preservation requires imperfection ("Its imperfection was the aperture"). The cost is legible in the contrast with failed caretakers who "shattered their chimes in frustration." The accumulative structure builds through ritual repetition toward "for a breath, the nook remembered itself," though the piece could anchor its temporal frame more precisely early on.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the symphonic performance transforms understanding with visible cost (tears, trembling, years to rebuild). The accumulative lens holds consistently through musical pattern discovery to choral resolution. Orientation anchored early (archive, linguist, Syrathi). Deduction for slight conceptual abstractness in the "semantic dissonance" explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through surveyor's chain measurements, harmonic resonance discovery, and final integration into floodgate systems—each layer reweighting the central stake of compassion versus control. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she commits to secretly embedding mercy into mechanical systems, with visible cost in her acceptance that "the world would never know." The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by ~100 words and maintains coherent causality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through dust motes, flight logs, and the meteorite's frequencies culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Argent resurrects the mother's melody. Cost is visible in Elara's weeping and the transformation from "reliquary of endings" to songs returning home. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the meteorite discovery and the child's letter arrival, though both serve the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - Elara's stepping into light/distance mirrors her father's sacrifice. The cost is legible in her dissolution and the bench's relieved sigh. The revelation of her own handwriting creates temporal paradox that enriches rather than breaks causality. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (who/where clarifies gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's shift from seeking to carrying belonging upward—a clear before/after with emotional cost paid through solitary descent and patient observation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the firefly convergence that reweights her isolation into purposeful solitude. Cost is visible in the burnt feather's transformation from "ending" to "beginning."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught seed-to-emotion mechanism paying off through density increase toward the crater glass revelation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when she reframes disappearance as gift rather than loss, with cost visible in "wear the missing pieces as adornments, not wounds." Early orientation anchors who/where/what by paragraph 2.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Elias continues his practice with accumulated meaning from the transformed audience members. The accumulative structure coheres with pattern-taught repetition ("lightly attentive" refrain, bishop as anchor). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. The cost is more conceptual than visceral - the ephemeral nature of his art against monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the protagonist transforms from fugitive to teacher, with villagers' arrival crystallizing this shift. The moonstone discovery provides causal linkage to the dance-inscription and teaching decision. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion, bleeding feet, and risk of breaking exile. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks (villagers arriving) reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered imagery (prism/rings/light) culminating in the Resonant Reconfiguration of taking the prism to transform Hargrove's view. Cost is felt in his accepted isolation and the ephemeral nature of his work ("rings...faded now, absorbed back into the whole"). The piece teaches its meditative pattern early and pays it off, though the stakes could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the scattering of letters - a decisive act that transforms burden into seeds. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through ritual reading. Deducted for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page; the "full" ending assertion needs more embodied proof.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly with pattern-building that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the resonance cascade that realigns timelines. Cost is visible in the "0.7 degrees of emotional latitude" and the specific changes in adjacent timelines. The grotto-as-convergence-point anchors orientation early, and the repetitive pattern-launch-observe cycle creates coherent pressure toward the final multiverse exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the cartographer's decision to leave her sketch with the diaries, passing on rather than carrying the burden alone. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as density increases through diary fragments and wall-listening, culminating in the final exhale of the passage. Cost is visible in "her satchel lighter, her heart heavier."

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught lyric design that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where mirrors transform into doorways. The closure lands with felt cost as the painter dissolves into dusk, having seeded fractures for light. Orientation anchors (terrace, spring, dusk) establish by ~100 words. The borrowed heartbeat's return through natural elements creates coherent linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear accumulative structure builds from solitary preparation through ritual inscription to collective signing, with the ebony clipboard serving as both literal and symbolic anchor throughout. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - peace achieved not through victory but through ritual significance and collective vulnerability. Cost is visible in the "imperfect mosaic of consent" and the acknowledgment that this is beginning, not completion.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's offering of the egg as echo rather than resurrection, with cost visible in his lighter steps and the melody clinging to his collar. The accumulative pattern of destruction/preservation coheres beautifully at closure. Minor orientation delay (protagonist's name at line 3) and some abstract moments ("manufactured drought" could be more concrete initially) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as the harvest of echoes spills outward, transforming the courtyard from silver silence to "alive with murmurs." The cost is legible: she unlocks voices but steps away without claiming them, becoming "keeper of the defiant hum." Early orientation anchors who/where/when clearly ("chaste courtesan stood barefoot in the silver courtyard under snow").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where serenity is "earned" through accepting conflict rather than avoiding it. The closure lands with visible cost—his acceptance of Mira's potential rejection. Orientation anchors clearly (radar dome, post-argument). Deduction for heavy reflection percentage (~35%) though it's anchored to present objects and alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the grotto achieves peace through witnessed dissolution. The piece teaches its pattern of temporary creation/dissolution early and pays it off with the monarch's benediction and the structure's planned unraveling. Cost is visible in the certainty of erasure ("By morning, rain would loosen the knots"). Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some abstract passages that momentarily blur the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance building to a Conceptual Repricing where preservation shifts from vaults to vibration. The closure lands with clear cost—the narrator's unsigned work and empty hands signify sacrifice for collective memory. Orientation anchors (icebound sanctum, lost wax caster) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with dream-state descent as the pivotal method for revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transcends temporal limitation. The "You were always the path" revelation reweights the entire journey with clear conceptual cost (the bunker's collapse, her transformation). Orientation anchored early with setting and character situation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the tile's activation reveals "a frequency buried in spacetime" that transforms understanding while the astronomer continues his vigil. Cost is visible throughout (poverty, isolation, "page 3,412" showing years of dedication). The piece anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Slight deduction because the transformation's precise stakes could be clearer—what exactly changes beyond confirming the resonance?

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the melody's migration from broken object to body creates undeniable cost (loss of external anchor) and reconfigures the protagonist's teaching method. The pattern of dissolution ("edges bleeding into water") established early pays off when she walks "into the mist, humming." Orientation anchors clearly: sanctuary, pacifist protagonist, broken music box as catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where dream flows into mirror "like ink into water," with visible cost in "her final craft" and the fog thickening again. The accumulative structure builds through breathing rhythm, sextant resonance, and apple blossoms to earn the integration moment. Slight deduction for the cost being more stated ("not because she would die") than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the green fabric crystallizes that the daughter returned but won't reconcile yet, reweighting the blue ribbon's meaning with undeniable emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds as vow-gathering builds to this discovery. Who/where/when anchored early through cathedral setting and Guild backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the curator's shift from seeking forbidden knowledge to understanding inheritance as "resonance across possibilities," with clear cost in her dissolution of prior selves. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the orchard's transformation and the curator's layered realizations. The closure lands with "no longer bewildered, but awake" carrying conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the library reveals itself as a teacher and the mountain "holds its breath" while knowledge chooses when to be found—a genuine Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (abandoning extraction for reconciliation). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the pattern of linguistic/botanical metaphors accumulates toward the diary-as-bridge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accepting the name Lirien transforms her state with felt cost ("lighter yet heavier"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories build toward the garden revelation. Minor opacity in the early carnival ship setup delays full orientation, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the door's dissolution after the rope's integration shows visible cost (the anomaly ceases to exist once properly placed). The accumulative lens holds as patterns build toward this reconfiguration. Slight deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt at the precise closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the caves transform from screaming to breathing, the energy beings from storms to drifting lights. Cost is visible in the melting ice wall "dripping in slow metronome" and the largest being's transformation to "dawn mist." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost—the custodian accepts her role as "receiver" with the weight of understanding her summoning. The accumulative structure coheres through star-alignment to vision to self-recognition, with the prism as persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist transforms from recorder to archive ("the deepening hush now inside her — not as emptiness, but as archive"). Cost is visible in her acceptance of eventual erasure and the weight of carrying others' memories. The piece teaches its pattern early through shadow-measuring and memory-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mosaic dance sequence builds through accumulative pressure to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the star's appearance crystallizes Lira's defiance with clear cost (sacrificing her kerosene talisman). The textural lens holds consistently through sensory accumulation and harmonic resonance, with the final "spark takes root—not in sky, but in soul" reweighting the journey's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Charged Poise closure lands cleanly—both characters crystallize in "the pause" with options legible and cost felt through the companion's "long and slow" exhale. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as impressions layer toward the insight about transition periods. Cost appears in "hesitation, human" and the unresolved migration question, though it could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the child collects different silence flavors, building to a resonant reconfiguration where they choose the wild garden over the bunker. Cost is felt in the falling "sideways, through a fold in the sky" - an irreversible departure from known security. The gravity inversion provides clear causality for escape, though the magical realism elements strain credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the golden pulse of completion in the storm glass as the woman departs transformed. The piece teaches its pattern early (terrace tiles humming, storm glass swirls) and pays off with felt cost as she releases the letter's weight. Minor orientation delay (gondola's nature unclear initially) doesn't harm the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist gains perspective and chooses which version of herself to carry forward, with visible cost (the orchard's collapse, the spent ruby flake). The stairway descent through frozen moments and the throne's revelation effectively tighten options. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the speculative elements.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation from sanctuary to open field, with clear cost ("suffocation ends... when you stop fighting the shape of your own throat"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight opacity in the middle transition from door to field prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara transforms pressure into crystallized clarity, with visible cost paid through channeling her betrayals. The bolt-as-key setup pays off when she presses it into the shadowseam, creating diamond-like structures from resolved tension. Orientation anchors effectively (mushroom farm, Elara's role, her past). Minor deduction for the quantum promise concept remaining somewhat abstract despite its central role.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's understanding pivots from destroyer to rightful heir, with clear cost in the loss of her assumed identity. Causality holds through the gramophone revelation, though the late introduction of the "swapped child" mechanism feels slightly convenient. The orientation anchors (reading room, evening, dynasty context) arrive within acceptable windows.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the knight transforms from withdrawn/armored to unfolded/permeable, with visible cost in surrendering mechanical control. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the marionette sequences, building to the threads-as-conduits payoff. Orientation anchors (knight, greenhouse, night) establish by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of "possibility" as concept rather than fully dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the archivist's reframing from filing endings to magnifying beginnings, with visible cost in her acknowledged ongoing sorrow. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered artifact (button, handprints, crayon drawing) deepens the pattern until the supervisor's recognition validates her method. The final image of the button as "compass" rather than "relic" crystallizes this reconfiguration with felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from lagoon observation through archive infiltration to broadcast success, with Elira's resourcefulness driving each turn. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the regime's control fractures through restored memories, with cost visible in Elira's necessary vanishing. The puddle-map discovery mechanism strains credibility slightly, and the ease of her escape undercuts the established danger, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the prism's shattering and prophecy's dissolution, with clear cost in the permanent silencing that "must never be broken again." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherent pressure through musical accumulation toward the Resonant Reconfiguration ending. Minor orientation delays (protagonist's identity emerges gradually) serve the atmospheric purpose without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elira's transformation from passive decoder to active memory-weaver, with the grandmother's emergence crystallizing this shift. The accumulative lens holds consistently as density increases from leaf-patterns to dust-specks to the final sanctuary of echoes. Cost is legible in "Elira wept, moss blooming where her tears touched earth" and the weight of carrying "unsung elegies."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns build toward Elias's philosophical reconfiguration, with the admiral's journal crystallizing the thematic shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (abandoning his repair practice for "Tinkerer of Lost Directions"). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for slightly mechanical pattern setup (third pigeon, fifth customer, seventh kettle) and some causality softness in the middle cavern exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as alchemical ritual accumulates meaning through named regrets until the coin's kintsugi shattering reconfigures Elara's identity with felt cost. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the golden seam proving sacred breakage. Deduction for slight orientation delay (foundry's purpose unclear initially) and some causality softness in how the coin "responds" to intention.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ghosts' integration into the gorge's elements, with laughter literally seeping into wind and water. The accumulative lens holds as spectral confessions layer and transform through musical harmonization. Cost is visible in the collector's "throat tight with luminous ache" and the ghosts' gradual fading as they integrate. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where anchors solidify around word 150).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the mathematics of mercy shifts from external equation to "space to be inhabited." Cost is legible in the pewter strap's dissolution and the protagonist's shift from "bracing" to "presence." The forest's response to pain creates coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - the historian's grief transforms to recognition of resilience. Cost is visible in the memory payment to Mara and the lens's spent energy. The pattern of hidden truths becoming visible charges the ending effectively, though early orientation could be slightly cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the building "keeping vigil" and him as "the witness it had been waiting for," with visible cost in carrying others' unfinished stories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns, found objects, and ghostly presence build density toward the crystallized ending stance. Orientation anchors clearly (abandoned circus ticket office, repair technician), and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library transforms from perfect equilibrium to "beautifully broken" with clear cost—the loss of flawless systems. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure builds through frost patterns, whisper release, and reality rupture to the final image of "unshackled moments." Minor orientation lag (operator's name/purpose withheld) serves the cryptic tone but doesn't enhance closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the revolutionary finds purpose in "translation" rather than triumph. The cost is legible in "wept—not for loss, but for possibility" and the foreclosed path of traditional revolution. The mirror-covering discovery provides causal linkage that transforms understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the repairman transforms from mechanical fixer to "keeper of unsung melodies," with visible cost in confronting his past lie. The covenant of rust revelation—that truth emerges through wear rather than decay—reweights the entire premise. Causality holds as his guilt directly motivates the singing solution, though the midnight shadows' arrival feels slightly arbitrary despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through petrichor descriptions, stone breathing, and mineral accretion building to Elira's choice to remain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she chooses belonging over return, with cost visible in the sealing passage "like a closing eyelid." The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—villagers shift from GPS-dependence to archway-gathering, with the sculpture becoming a "living archive." The accumulative lens holds as layered meanings build through the magic slide's shifting tableau, Elara's carving, and the community's ongoing contributions. Minor deduction for the slightly extended denouement after the core transformation completes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure—the artist discovers encoded nocturnal flowers in cathedral glass, then returns to paint her own night-blooming mural. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she accepts mystery over solution ("still reckons—not to solve, but to surrender"). Cost is visible in her transformation from seeker to keeper of secrets, though the journey-return structure feels somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the archivist becoming "the living ledger" and accepting her role as witness, with visible cost in "sleeps little now." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through debris arrangements, phosphorescent revelations, and the final "We are not gone. We are waiting." However, the midpoint stretches thin with summary ("Scholars arrived with scanners") rather than dramatized pressure, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building density through the proliferation of lanterns and growing community participation. The closure—"civilization was not restored. It was reborn"—delivers a Conceptual Repricing with clear cost: the old town and its ways are permanently lost. The pattern of lantern emergence teaches its logic early and pays off through collective transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through the "velvet disquiet" transformation spreading via petals. The prophecy creates meaningful tightening that shifts purpose from archiving to awakening. Cost is visible in the city's emotional sterility being quietly disrupted. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the emotional ecosystem concept.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the atrium's transformation from frozen to blooming, with Elara's laughter "rooting" into earth as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is legible in "droplets rose upward...each holding a flicker of color, a scent, a half-remembered song" - lost moments returning differently. Slight deduction for the abstract "vortex inheritance" concept that never fully clarifies its mechanics on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sensor details, calibration metrics, and the bell's eventual organic activation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as trust replaces fear in the village's response, with visible cost in the seventeen-year silence and the protagonist's humble, unrecognized work. Minor orientation friction with "after the glue dries" as temporal anchor feels more metaphorical than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the comet's efflorescence creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the janitor's practice of witnessing. Cost is felt through tears of recognition and the contrast between archived nothing and experienced everything. The orientation anchors clearly (station, Andromeda Drift, janitor role) and causality holds through textural deepening rather than plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the beekeeper's ghost turns with gratitude and the recluse bows - a crystallized moment where her role as keeper is acknowledged. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through ghost observations and ritual repetition. Cost is legible in her covenant's weight and isolation, though the exact price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Vey's shift from counting seconds to curating echoes reweights the entire premise with felt cost. The capsule opening and urn fusion create causal momentum toward understanding time's texture rather than fixing it.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy's acceptance of "differently" flying kite with visible emotional cost (grief acknowledged) landing in laughter. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from lagoon description through kite repair to final "gloriously, tenderly, incomplete." Cost is legible in the boy's hollow eyes transforming to curiosity to joy.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through copper-guided geometries, creature interactions, and architectural evolution until the final burial beneath the Whisper Arch reweights the entire orchard as living cathedral. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the diary bound to oak and children learning "respect not by lecture, but by living inside the design." Cost is felt through Arlen's shallow breath, final sigh, and the permanence of his absence while his design persists.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's realization that "truth was emergent—born where paths crossed." The cost is legible in her abandonment of peer review and quantifiable certainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, with density increasing toward the tower summit and a clear cadence shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual planting toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "some journeys are measured not in miles, but in sprouts." The cost is legible in "the tight, trembling space between what was lost and what might yet grow." Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words (coachman, jetty at twilight, post-war). The pattern of seed-planting-as-restoration teaches early and pays off in the final wagon departure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught revelation system (colored projections through leaf). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the settlement transforms from salvage to resonance economy, with clear cost (the weight of carrying voices). The handler's voice discovery provides meaningful tightening that narrows Bracken's path. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the "distance into closeness" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when her sketching "grants peace" to the temporal anomaly, with visible cost (isolation as "pariah"). The accumulative structure coheres through the sketching ritual. Deducted for slightly abstract cost articulation and some causality softness in how sketching affects the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the chess swap transforms the frozen game and repairs the sky, with visible cosmic cost ("mothers dreamed of laughter instead of loss"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the transformation. Orientation anchors clearly (thief, spire, wrong sky). Minor deduction for the cost being somewhat abstract rather than personally felt by Elric.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching ("heel-to-toe arcs tracing glyphs") that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator's walking spell "listen" forces the sovereign to confront "luminous absence." The closure lands with clear conceptual cost: the sovereign trembles from "the terror of being truly seen," and the gallery whispers back with all the small gestures that held the world together—a decisive reweighting of power dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the seer discovers home is "not found, but remembered" through the stone's transformation, with clear emotional cost in her kneeling "not in worship, but in arrival." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish concrete stakes (past line 120). The shift from external seeking to internal recognition lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "forgiveness had not come from decree or deed, but from winnowing the past until only truth remained" with visible cost in the mirror scene. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through tapestry work to the mirror's acceptance. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2 with "time-frozen village."

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the spire dissolving into "mist that smelled of rain and burnt sugar" as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the artist's refracted apologies achieve what unified truth could not. The canyon's transformation of words into echoes builds pressure through repetition. Cost is visible in the spire's ancient grief-stricken face and the artist's isolation atop the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the matching of wounds to memories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the workshop transforms from "raft on oblivion" to "altar." The cost is viscerally felt through the alchemist's tears becoming golden lacquer and her acceptance of brokenness. Slight deduction for minor orientation wobble (the statue's sudden appearance could be better anchored).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's acceptance that "reflection wasn't in glass, but in motion." The cost appears in leaving the painted shell behind and accepting impermanence. The accumulative structure coheres, though the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls between cave entry and painting.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's act transforms multiple ships' courses through "vibrations of intent," with visible cost in her exhaustion and relief "thick as honey in her throat." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image of her as broadcaster of tenderness. The closure lands cleanly with "This was her language. This was how the world healed," though the transformation of the ships feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—the navigator's acceptance of "recalibration" over "abandonment" with visible cost (the hydraulics' failure, isolation). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from physical station to metaphysical navigation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality opacity around the phone calls' mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory density and pattern shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases the relic and transforms her relationship to truth. The cost is felt in her surrender of control—"letting safety grow wild and unowned." Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries—body, flower, memory-flash, photograph connection—culminating in Silas's decision to preserve rather than report. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Silas chooses to guard the secret, foreclosing the path of official investigation with the felt cost of "witnessed isolation." The orientation anchors clearly (dock, lighthouse keeper, three nights prior) and causality traces cleanly from flower to memory to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias steps through the doorway, accepting transformation. The sister's survival and their pending reunion creates visible cost (abandoning his shop/old life). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with bleeding starlight as the central metaphor building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen becomes "vessel" and "witness." The closure lands with visible cost—she must "unbury what you buried" and descend transformed. Orientation anchors (queen, cliff, dusk) establish early; the grotto revelation reweights her entire history through the pool visions.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) when the alchemist transforms guilt into "pigment" for their next chapter, with visible emotional cost in Elias's tears and the nexus's approving glow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through sensory accretion toward this transformative moment. Orientation anchors clearly (alchemist, Elias, ember nexus at twilight). Deduction for slightly abstract handling of "presence" and "revaluation" concepts that could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts chronological confusion as creative power ("I'm the one braiding the threads"). Cost is visible in the grave acceptance and jealousy of past selves' innocence. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, post-cemetery) arrive promptly. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation, though "soar... through" lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors (broken clocks, fulcrums, ordinary miracles) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her new form of practice. Cost is visible in her throat tightening and the weight of understanding. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2. Deduction for slight causality softness in the middle third where reflection dominates action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where scars transform from wounds to "waypoints." Cost is visible in the physical scars and emotional weight, though the resolution lands slightly soft - the alchemical transformation metaphor tells rather than fully dramatizes the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—two broken people reconnecting imperfectly while the orchard awaits destruction. The induced currents sequence transforms memory into shared experience, making reconciliation possible. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from past betrayal to present apology to fragile reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spiral arbitration paying off in the witness becoming "the hush after"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost. The universe's hiccups bracket and punctuate the transformation effectively. Orientation anchors (temple library, witness role) establish early.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the final realization that "time isn't lost. It's just waiting to be wound the other way" reweights the entire premise with philosophical cost. The accumulative structure coheres well through repetition and deepening. Deduction for slightly abstract cost—the "razor edge before the fall" needs more concrete embodiment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris transforms from hunting breaches to facilitating departures, with visible cost as the stranger dissolves into the soil. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final reweighting of her role. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "permissions" and "expansion" in the final lines, though the cost is felt through the dissolution scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well with the cryptic scrawls building toward connection with other seekers. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara's "Begin again" crystallizes her stance with felt cost. The pattern teaches itself through the subway glyphs and lantern's contradictory light.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered wrong-number vignettes that build toward the operator becoming part of her own system—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("began, quietly, to end her own"). The closure lands cleanly as she dissolves into the tunnel's atmosphere, though the conceptual weight occasionally outpaces the dramatic pressure in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the archivist's ritual building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where continuing to archive becomes both burden and devotion. The covenant's regeneration through small acts (recipe-learning, returned gloves) creates legible cost in the acceptance of generational responsibility. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the covenant's initial breaking being told rather than dramatized, though the closure lands cleanly with "stitch by ink-stained stitch."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the station transforms from "monument to abandonment" to space of "murmured stories" through reciprocal exchanges. The cost is visible in shared vulnerability—both Elara and the man expose their loneliest memories, with his tears and her transferred warmth marking the price. Pattern teaches early through the "Trade stories, not coins" setup and pays off when "reciprocity had catalyzed itself."

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist transforms from receiver to composer of languages, with the platinum ring left as payment. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (G-sharp nostalgia, C-minor regret) toward the stillpoint revelation. The cost is visible in sacrificing her compass-tool and accepting the paradox of being "more whole, more lost."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist shifts from forcing edits to "inviting them," with visible cost in the mentor's disappearance and the "wrong seeds" bearing unintended harvests. The accumulative structure coheres as each small edit builds toward the revelation that "history was not a stone tablet, but wet clay," though orientation of the anomaly's physical space could anchor earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara teaches the mute girl, crystallizing the theme that silence contains symphonies. The accumulative structure builds through sign-as-music gestures toward this meaningful encounter. However, the cost remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we're told the music "would vanish with the tide" but don't experience what Elara sacrifices to create this ephemeral art.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the protagonist stepping into light as "curator of the scorched and sacred," with visible cost in her criminal status above versus prophetic role below. The accumulative/textural lens holds as discoveries build density toward the archive's singing response, teaching its pattern early through "volcanic tenderness" and paying off in the merger of destruction/preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through drumming that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from victim to creator. The cost is visible in "auroral sorrow that clung to her—not as grief, but as grace." Orientation anchors clearly (experimental subject, sound garden, 27 souls). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of silent observation building to the final whisper-based justice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena proves whispers' power by orchestrating Delgado's quiet downfall, with visible cost in his removal. The coin-as-key revelation that opens ears rather than doors effectively reweights the entire navigation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the guardian's work validates through the drowned woman's smile and the single unswallowed star—visible cost in "half-spoken, half-seen, wholly necessary." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern-weaving builds to this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (canal location emerges gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the spreading arbors that transform the town's consciousness, with visible cost in characters abandoning safe paths. The accumulative lens holds consistently, building from library to town-wide phenomenon. The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the closure lands with Milo's proposal representing collective transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira transforms from hauling cargo to carrying hope, with visible cost in dissolving the scrimshaw and accepting a harder path. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and mythic elements build toward her transformation. Orientation anchors (sublittoral fringe, post-violence world) establish setting efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through repetitive whittling, turbine imagery, and compliance theater, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where "perfectly compliant" carries the full weight of survival's cost. The orientation anchors early (farmhouse, porch, turbines) and the closure lands with undeniable emotional price in the gap between performance and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the poet communes with the lake in a crystallized moment where "The ban was gone. The poet remained." Cost is felt through seventeen years of enforced silence and the "tremor of certainty" that roots like a seed cracking stone, though the actual stakes of entering remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through plant arrangements building to the courtyard's awakening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marta commits to "wake the kiln" with root and rust, showing transformation with clear cost (abandoning traditional glasswork). The reed tongue as resonator creates causal linkage between arrangement and awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elira's song releases the trapped harmonies, transforming silence from empty to "golden shadows—warm, alive, layered." The accumulative structure builds texture effectively through prismatic echoes and sympathetic resonance, with visible cost in her tears and the "afterglow of presence," though the philosophical questions mid-story slightly dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—someone unfolds an offering and the maker returns to her work, crystallizing her role as grief's cartographer. The piece teaches its pattern early (observatory as timeless suspension, coordinates as breadcrumbs) and pays off when curtains stir remotely, signaling connection. Cost is visible in "grief had scraped her soul to marrow" and the endless labor of creating vessels for others' pain.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered observations of cultural reconstruction. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the visitor articulates "remembering forward," reweighting the cartomancer's observations with conceptual cost visible in the shift from individual mapping to shared understanding. The orientation anchors clearly (cartomancer, loft, post-crash era), though the piece relies heavily on description over dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through sensory immersion in the archive's emotional atoms, culminating in the historian's patternless humming that releases rather than erases memory. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when grief transforms from ownership to coexistence ("lighter, not because the grief was gone, but because it no longer owned her"). Cost is felt through blood, tears, and the saffron veil darkening with salt. However, the civilization's backstory of choosing "to forget joy to survive sorrow" arrives late without sufficient present anchoring, creating mild drag.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira embeds the stone and dreams gain texture—a Charged Poise where hope's transformation is accepted with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the shadow's revelation. Orientation anchors clearly (Elira, library above clouds, dream-archive era). Deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara's stance crystallizes through the reconstruction ritual, foreclosing naive trust while preserving compassionate action. Cost is visible in her sacrificing savings and safety for the smaller sanctuary. Orientation anchored early (workshop, post-revelation timeframe). Minor deduction for slightly abstract middle passages about conviction-shedding.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the final Resonant Reconfiguration landing powerfully—Elira's integration with the seed transforms her fundamental approach from seeking endings to embracing continuation, with visible cost in her weeping recognition of the "lie she'd carried." The hourglass's transformation from frozen to "spiraling outward" crystallizes this shift. Slight deduction for the convenient tunnel opening, though the plant telepathy setup partially earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the gazer releases letters into motion, transforming storage into release with felt cost ("decades too late"). The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery deepens the central question of where unused love belongs. However, the cost could be more visceral—we see the conceptual shift but the personal price remains somewhat oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where mass liberation occurs with visible cost (protagonist's tears, trembling exhaustion). The accumulative structure builds density effectively through the winter crescendo. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherence. Deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the archway's physical location relative to the town.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the chess clock's trembling second hand and brightening petals signal successful cultivation with visible cost (the guard's slight shoulder softening). The divergent archive sequence builds pressure through selective restoration, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure with the protagonist stepping into the void as "a pioneer—home at last in the frontier of his own becoming," with clear cost (letting go of the physical/known world). The accumulative lens holds consistently through frequency-based navigation and sensory layering. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (who/where clarifies gradually rather than by ~120 words).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the discovered artifacts (shoe, whistle) that reweight courage from action to patience. However, the orientation remains deliberately vague past 120 words ("veiled ridgeways" never anchors spatially), costing -0.4, though this serves the dreamlike accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure when playing the piano reweights the entire fortress's frozen state, with visible cost in the bellhop's "trembling" and "clumsy with cold and memory" hands. The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern breaks (silence/sound, frozen/thaw). Minor orientation lag in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis when she refuses the throne with "I move where truth is forgotten, and leave before it is worshipped," foreclosing her path with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres but the middle exposition about weeks passing dulls momentum between the library setup and the font revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery that coral hasn't died but metamorphosed, with clear cost shown in twenty years of hidden data and her mentor's desperate concealment. The accumulative/textural lens holds as tapping rhythms, sonar logs, and bioluminescent revelations build toward the crystallized understanding that "some losses aren't endings."

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the protagonist's shift from seeking war's reignition to seeding remembrance through the aria. The cost lands tangibly as others emerge "drawn not by duty, but by resonance," fundamentally reweighting the rebellion's meaning. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly within the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught motifs (steam, memory, seeds) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the embryo dissolves into collective potential rather than individual power. The cost is legible in her physical exhaustion and the seventeen moons of labor, with the final image of children finding unnamed seedlings crystallizing the transformation. Slight opacity around the kite's role as inciting element.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through sketching, pearl imagery, and the arboretum collaboration toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where carrying "the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse" shows internalized change with felt cost. The freeze moment effectively deepens options. Slight deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally shown in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's transformation and the tarot box's reassembly "not perfectly, but functionally," with visible cost in the compression sequence. The accumulative lens holds throughout, though the fantastical elements ("sea rose vertically") slightly muddy causality without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of disappearing ink building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tracker dissolves into "negative space between moments." The cost is conceptually clear—she sacrifices physical existence for understanding. Minor deduction because the exact mechanics of her dissolution could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with the archivist's choice triggering cascading emotional contagion throughout society—a Decisive Change with clear cost (her erasure). The Resonance Table mechanism and dormant networks provide coherent causality, though early orientation could anchor more concretely. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern of emotional transmission effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with the rose farm as persistent constraint and the final seed-giving as Resonant Reconfiguration showing continuity's cost against the ruined world. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherent pressure through vignettes. Deduction for slightly soft cost articulation - while the "weight of choosing gentleness" is stated, the specific price Elara pays remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the echo transforms the constellations from grieving to purposeful, with the fisher becoming carrier rather than catcher. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sonic layers build toward the spike's rupture, though the cost of carrying versus catching could be more explicitly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Causal lens with clear closure—the protagonist's intervention through documented evidence creates a Decisive Change that exposes the cover-up. The orientation anchors (observatory, after journalist's call) establish cleanly by ~100 words. Cost is visible in the "orbits of regret" and the price of constant vigilance. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical reveal of the archive's burning schedule feeling convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as haunted firmware transforms from amplifying sorrow to translating cries "into something bearable" with visible cost (blood mixed with ink). Causal linkage holds as protagonist's actions directly transform the machine. Deduction for late orientation—the laboratory's nature and protagonist's role aren't fully anchored until paragraph 3, though this disorientation does serve the surreal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the rain-watching scene where the artist applies her grotto lesson to everyday perception (musician's yearning beneath off-key notes). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through whisper harmonization to final recognition, with cost visible in the cracked tile flake and abandoned mandala.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through collective renaming that transforms the plaza from ruin to "cradle unbroken," with visible cost in Elira's bleeding palm and the survivors' "hollowed eyes." The accumulative structure builds through individual renamings ("beggar" to "keeper of stories") that crescendo into communal transformation, though the magistrate's conversion feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghost transforms from seeking encores to enabling others' performances, with clear cost (her dissolution). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases. Minor deduction for soft orientation ("the business" remains vague) but the mystical setting teaches its rules early enough to support the fantastical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as somatic markers accumulate into a method for navigation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira transforms from isolated sufferer to guide opening her studio. Cost is visible in tears and the risk of sharing fractured methods, though the orientation anchor "three nights prior" creates mild temporal blur that doesn't fully resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the fossil's transformation into a communication relay. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist becomes participant rather than observer, with cost visible in the fossil's dissolution. The orientation anchors (post-hibernation world, cave mapper) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as details layer to reweight meaning, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where isolated prophecy transforms into communal weaving. The cost is legible in the abandonment of solitary sanctuary for shared vulnerability. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "truth unraveling above" which lacks concrete dramatization of what specifically changes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—she sacrifices potential vindication for a gamble on future discovery. The accumulative structure coheres through seasonal/burial metaphors. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the relay station's significance (~300 words).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory detail until the final needle exchange crystallizes as Charged Poise—the passenger's acceptance reweights all prior material with visible cost (her trembling recognition). The palimpsest promise ("Distill complexity into essence") anchors early and pays off when she takes the needle to "unstitch what binds." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (fog-bound river crossing, predawn routes), and causality holds as rain cessation triggers the veil-thinning moment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught time fractures paying off in resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands through Earned Stasis (leaving the pot unfired) with visible cost in choosing porosity over permanence. Minor orientation delay in opening but recovers through concrete anchoring by second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's act of installing prisms transforms the neighborhood's capacity for wonder, with visible cost in her physical exhaustion and the dying rosebush. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as density builds through repeated prism placements. Slight deduction for the lockmaster's tooth metaphor taking time to clarify its thematic function.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught brass/stone resonance system paying off when Veyra channels her atomic resonance to stabilize the failing hum—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("knees damp, breath slow"). The shift from extinction coordinates to genesis coordinates marks decisive change. Minor deduction for slightly delayed spatial orientation (cloud-library relationship clarifies gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Aris becomes the temple's living pulse, transforming from writer to embodied connection itself. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the ritual of names becoming origami birds, though the transformation mechanism ("dissolving into light") lacks concrete sensory grounding. Cost is visible (loss of human form) but the emotional price could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from signal detection through counter-frequency deployment to community calming, with clear cost (Elira abandoning protocol, risking exposure). The closure shows Earned Stasis - she remains vigilant against future threats. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's embodiment of the key transforms her relationship to space itself, with visible cost in her terror during the narrow passage and payoff in the widened return path. The harmonic cipher setup pays off precisely when she becomes the key, though early world-building about "spatial mutiny" takes time to crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with texture memories anchoring the investigation and building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where empathy awakens through shared grief. Cost is visible in the killer's tears and trembling, though the resolution of three cold cases without bodies strains plausibility slightly. Who/where/when anchored early through quarry setting and '89 timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elara transforms exile into power through completing her grandfather's work, with visible cost in the burning nail and conceptual cost in choosing memory over pardon. The stanza discovery → machine activation → storm response → jet stream shift provides clear escalation. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (weather station, Isla Vire, Elara sorting journals). The ending reweights exile as pilgrimage with earned authority, though the mechanics of storm control could be more precise.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery layers (glass flake, scaffold flutters, pixelated amnesty) build toward the fiddler's permission to be remade. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he steps forward with "never" transformed from sentence to sculptable space, cost visible in "years" of stasis broken. Opening orientation is deliberately atmospheric but who/where/when anchors by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where he "learned to dance in the loop." The cost is visible in the startup's collapse and his acceptance of circular paths. However, the piece relies heavily on reflection (>30%) without sufficient present-frame micro-choices to fully anchor it, creating some temporal blur between past events and current state.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered revelations about stars as burden-holders, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chronicler transforms from passive receiver to active redistributor. The cost is visible in her "trembling fingertips" and the weight she accepts. The shift from understanding stars speak burdens to actively redistributing them through song creates meaningful closure with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the druid's transformation from guarded to revealed, with visible cost in her physical/emotional unbending. The accumulative/textural lens holds as expanding circles deepen pressure through layered revelations. Orientation anchors effectively (druid, cursed lake, after failed magic trick).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the ritual's completion and the covenant's awakening, with clear cost shown through the protagonist's physical fusion to the earth. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the climactic helix of light. However, the orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain somewhat abstract through the first third, and the worldbuilding relies heavily on conceptual exposition rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's grip loosening becomes "Not surrender—seedling" with roots weaving destinies together. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks (cards surfacing, orchard responding) that reweight meaning. Cost is visible in both characters' stances shifting. Orientation anchors establish setting immediately though "three nights prior" creates minor temporal wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration as Jasper shifts from "appraising ghosts" to "listening to them," crystallizing in "What's broken still carries song." Cost is legible in his three years of emotional suppression and the risk of reopening wounds. The orientation anchors (quarry trailer, antiques appraiser role) land within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elira's decision to step back and let the seedling grow independently, with clear cost in abandoning her scholarly impulse to translate. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as pressure builds through resonance, symbols, and the gradual germination sequence. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2-3 (Dr. Elira Voss, at the magnetic arbor above clouds, after the spirit's departure).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the librarian's acceptance of contradiction crystallizes her method with visible cost ("feeling her edges blur"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery (creel, pool, glyphs) that reweight the preservation of wonder. Orientation anchors clearly (librarian, tidal atrium, present moment), though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spiral confession mechanism that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the inspector becomes a conduit. The pearl's dissolution and the inspector's/caves' glow constitute visible transformation with clear cost (vulnerability through confession). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (bunker inspector, crystal caves, seeking pearl).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative structure coheres well with graffiti discoveries building toward earned self-acceptance. The closure - leaving "only the echo and the ivy, now slightly rearranged" - offers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Deduction for late orientation (the sister/flood backstory arrives past 60%) and some causality softness in how graffiti discoveries translate to internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the archive itself, with visible cost in the bone stylus scarring and the loss of individual identity. The recursive structure teaches its pattern early through the "cyclically reversed" stacks and pays off when she discovers all seekers are iterations of the same journey. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of becoming "the archive" without more concrete embodiment of what this transformation entails.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and plant communications build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where the Chancellor kneels in "dawning reverence." The cost is visible: the empire's collapse implied through his transformation and the violin's destruction. The "perforated destiny" concept effectively structures the accumulation of silenced histories into the final garden image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the emerald chip capturing the scholar's final conscious moment creates a "silent constellation" of preserved awareness. Cost is visible in "her hands trembling not with grief but reverence" and the irreversibility of the preservation ritual. The pattern of stillness accumulates effectively toward the ending vision of joining this constellation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early through "skyborne grotto under aurora."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's acceptance of contentment through the hairpin ritual. The cost is felt through her forgiveness of betrayal and the "weight of release." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation and limited dramatic pressure in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the cloak unhooking as a decisive change that reweights Elira's entire practice. Closure lands with clear cost—she'll lose clients but gain authenticity. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for the wind chimes' mechanical function being somewhat opaque initially.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's understanding that "vanishing isn't erasure—it's preparation," with the cost visible in Elira's paradoxical aging and isolation. Causality holds through deliberate withholding and revelation, though the orientation remains slightly abstract (the floating platform's physics are unexplained). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens fits the gradual revelation through ripples and symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught meditation on stillness that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the skimmer becomes "the landmark" rather than the seeker. The closure lands with conceptual cost—generations died seeking motion while the answer was stillness. The piece teaches its contemplative pattern early and maintains it throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Lior's shift from chasing grandeur to sharing simple magic carries visible cost (leaving the keystone, accepting rejection). The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (frost/luminance → mist-walk → cloud-tree) to earn the final stance. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when ("In this era").

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the ledger discovery serving as the decisive reconfiguration that reweights all prior material—the vow predating his birth transforms understanding of agency and destiny. The closure lands with conceptual cost as he transitions from seeker to signifier, accepting his role in an eternal pattern. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors arrive late) prevents higher scoring, though the deliberate withholding serves the mysterious tone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as the protagonist recognizes she's been guided by future selves, reweighting all prior lot-casting as agency rather than surrender. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static bursts intensify toward the vision that triggers her stance crystallization. Cost is visible in her trembling recognition and the choice to abandon her surrender-based system. Minor orientation lag (who the survivors are) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught crystallization method paying off at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration (from heartbroken to heart-carrier) lands with felt cost through the naming ritual. Orientation anchored early (reaper, observatory, dusk). Minor deduction for the "echo of sacrifice" remaining somewhat abstract despite the Her/storm backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the bell's restoration and the fish's return create a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cosmic rebalancing. The piece teaches its pattern early (dripping rates as cosmic language) and pays it off through methodical accumulation. Cost is visible in months of pre-dawn devotion and the risk of failure, though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's role transforms from warden to archivist with clear institutional cost. The photographs-to-shrine progression builds causally, each discovery deepening his engagement. Minor orientation wobble ("midnight ridgeway at twilight") and the supervisor confrontation feels slightly rushed, but the ending image of ongoing archival work reweights the opening's surveillance mandate effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: the crystal's sublimation into the flame represents the alchemist sacrificing her material catalyst to achieve spiritual transformation. The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward the moment where "fire and memory became one luminous breath," though the "before the final transformation" frame could anchor more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the protagonist accepting her role as pattern-maker rather than truth-teller. The orientation anchors (midnight, nocturnal arbor, post-static world) arrive within the first 120 words. Cost is visible in the weight of choosing "what to show" and the memory of the village's broken trust, though the final image could sharpen the price more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the brain's vivification and autonomous emergence, with visible cost in Kael's surrender of ownership. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered temporal and metaphysical elements toward the final transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the floating dojo setting remains spatially coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Conceptual Repricing—the final revelation that "The seed was never meant to flower" reweights the entire narrative with conceptual cost visible in Aris's lifetime dedication. Causality flows naturally from seed arrival through room creation to the plant's strange growth, with each development building pressure. The orientation anchors (escape room proprietor, nocturnal haven, brook) establish clearly within the first paragraph. Cost manifests through decades of patient cultivation and the rooms' effects on clients ("Some fled screaming"), though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure - the protagonist's nightly ritual represents endurance with visible cost (neighbors' judgment, emotional toll). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and builds density through layered imagery. Cost is legible in "refusing to let joy's memory rot in silence" and the ongoing price of grief work.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through interiorized landscapes building to the statue awakening and final transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the guardian's shift from exile to emissary with "uncertainty like a lantern" showing clear cost and reconfigured meaning. The pendant's transfer creating connection rather than power provides the decisive gesture. Slight dock for occasional opacity in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elric's transformation from seeking mastery to embracing perpetual becoming, with visible cost in his acceptance of the "hopeless" label. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery (frost/ember/twilight) that reweights at closure when the crozier becomes "not broken but becoming." The cost is legible in his acceptance that vivification "was not complete—it never would be," foreclosing the path to traditional mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist transforms from seeker to conductor, with visible cost in the fragment's dissolution and the towers' awakening. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered discoveries, though the middle section's Hollywood fragment exposition slightly interrupts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the merging of seven ferries and the deckhand's acceptance of "permanent transience" reconfigures the entire premise with felt cost. The pattern accumulates through vanishings, grotto discoveries, radio tuning, and harmonic beacons, each deepening understanding. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the supernatural premise takes time to clarify) though this serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gallery transforms and the architect discovers connection's texture through the sinew thread's branching. The cost is visible in the gallery's resistance and her acceptance of letting go. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "texture of connection" though the physical transformation grounds it well.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: humanity accepts its underwater exile while learning to navigate "unfolded horizons." The anchor's transformation from salvage to teaching tool crystallizes this acceptance with clear conceptual cost—never returning to the surface. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (holograms, pressure-sealed glass, bioluminescent towers) build toward Elira's final teaching moment where adaptation becomes survival.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost girl accepts her parents aren't returning but finds peace through acknowledgment of their love—a clear before/after with emotional cost visible in her tears and eventual calm. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from tracking pulses to finding the source to final resolution. Orientation anchors (atrium, twilight, contact tracer role) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the phase transition that returns presence to the forgotten workers, with visible cost (gold fleck crumbles, tide forces retreat). The accumulative lens holds consistently, building density through layered details toward the final witnessing, though the mechanism of "phase transition" could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through ink patterns and ghost defragmentation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where ghosts achieve coherence rather than erasure. Cost is visible in Aris's acceptance of his hollow role and the sting of the porcelain shard. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening paragraphs. Slight deduction for the conceptual weight of "wisdom from failure" not fully dramatized in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands powerfully as the canyon echoes her final word "forward, into the world beyond" with unmistakable emotional cost shown through weeping while speaking. The accumulative structure builds from silence through absorbed sound to released language, with each textural layer (diamond's hunger, flock's patterns, canyon's echoes) contributing to the final reconfiguration where a dead language lives again.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Elara's bitterness transmutes into "gravitational giggles" with visible cost (shattered phone, permanent tattoo marking). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered impossibilities—floating books, spinning thyme, falling upward—culminating in the "harmony untamed has taken root" closure that reweights the opening's frostbitten imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught transformation: music as tactile force that "uproots" mechanical obedience "note by note." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the orchard's reawakening with visible cost (violinist's blistered fingers, dust of the locust shell). The before/after is legible: from "metallic tang" and "metronomic precision" to "bees returned, buzzing drunkenly."

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the released storm signals "I'm here" to the child, reweighting the earlier promise. The accumulative build through arcade atmosphere, drone mechanics, and weather metaphors coheres well. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the drone border concept clarifies late) and some causality softness around how exactly the storm masks signatures.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly—the carousel's completion transforms abandonment into sanctuary with palpable cost (the carpenter's permanent commitment). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the halo fragment's function wavers between catalyst and ornament, slightly weakening causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through hyperbolic geometry leading to the amphitheater revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she reawakens stories, with cost visible in the scarf's glow and patrons' changed perception. The orientation anchors (librarian, library, night) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered descriptions of light-capturing toward the final reunion. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the dream manifests as presence rather than memory, with cost visible in the decades of searching. However, the exact nature of the transformation ("translucent but solid, real in the way only reclaimed absences can be") remains somewhat conceptually vague rather than dramatically concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Conceptual Repricing—the freed idea that "love, when spoken without armor, could reweave broken worlds" reweights the entire journey with conceptual cost visible in the generational fear. The accumulative structure coheres well, with the lock of hair serving as both literal key and symbolic vessel. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain somewhat abstract but serve the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise - the protagonist's smile and decision to stay crystallizes her options with clear cost (feeding the orchard "the rest"). The accumulative structure coheres through memory fragments building to revelation about the orchard's survival mechanism, though orientation takes slightly long to establish clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the cartographer's laugh—"not because he's found the city, but because he's stopped needing to"—with visible cost in abandoning his original quest. The accumulative structure coheres as tea-leaf patterns, shadow containment, and backwards walking converge to reweight mentorship as broken things teaching wholeness. The reversible exile mechanism creates persistent stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the seed's successful germination and Elira's role as "steward" reweight the opening's "budding hope" with earned fulfillment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories and essences layer to create the conditions for transformation. Cost is visible in Elira's tears, the "decades of wind and wisdom," and the sealing of the worlds' seam.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through each knot's release ("boy's laugh," "mother's lullaby," "sailor's oath") until the violent unraveling of the guilt-knot reweights all prior gentle releases. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the sanctuary itself becomes "unknotted," with visible cost in the protagonist's physical toll and the weight of endless future work. Minor orientation delay (who/where crystallizes gradually) but pays off in the prism sanctuary's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition driving the closure—the shadow's choreographed spiral reveals the chapel's negative space. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as she witnesses the "whispered chapel" through accumulated video evidence, with clear emotional cost ("wept...from recognition"). Orientation anchors (vault, henge, fresco) establish early and the pattern-teaching through video analysis pays off at sunset.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist releases the snow globe and waves to death, completing an earned transformation from analytical detachment to acceptance with visible cost (the globe "unmade"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through the snow globe's impossible physics accumulating meaning until the final release. Who/where/when anchored adequately by "library sank with the ship" and "after locating Amelia Earhart's plane."

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increasing through color-coded messages, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms into invitation with visible cost (tears, vulnerability). The closure lands cleanly with "even ghosts in code need ballads" reweighting the entire exchange. Orientation anchors (courtyard, terminal, ghost) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the servant internalizes the captain's wisdom about joy within suffering. The cipher discovery at floor five creates causal progression, and the final image of fractured goggles as "a lens of gratitude" reweights the entire ascent with felt cost. Orientation anchors (elevator, ten floors, ascending servant) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—her smile represents acceptance that "empty spaces remember," with cost visible in months of isolation. The gondola setting and cloud cataloging accumulate texture toward this reweighting. Deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where crystallizes slowly) and the cost being more conceptual than visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the protagonist sitting beneath her painted sky as demolition begins—cost is visible in the imminent destruction. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this crystallized moment. Slight dock for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with the hopscotch cipher discovery creating a decisive change that transforms the ship's capabilities and Arlen's role. The closure lands with Arlen "whisper[ing] back" to the world's blank spaces, showing earned mastery with clear cost (three nights of obsessive work). Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from "locksmith chasing prophecy" to "keeper of quiet mendings." The closure lands with conceptual cost (surrendering the physical tools for internalized wisdom). Orientation anchors establish clearly (lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen library, seeking the Hall of Mirrors), though the seven winters of preparation feels slightly disconnected from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community's synchronized action manifests the nebula, with visible cost in leaving the dying orchard behind. The accumulative structure builds from chalk messages to bell discovery to collective ritual, each layer deepening the dominant stake of survival-through-unity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the adjuster's completed duty transforms universal death into gentle sleep, with visible cost in the dissolution of everything. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, spiral stairs) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the caretaker returns to "assembling tomorrow's invisible path" with visible cost. The nut-as-memory-key and curse mechanics are well-established. Slight ambiguity in how exactly the girl escapes despite following his trails prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the chemist's shifted understanding—from viewing separation as failure to seeing it as transformation. The cost (accepting daughter's death, releasing need for permanence) is felt through concrete images like the swept-away chrysalis. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (ravine location clear, but temporal anchoring vague until "last monsoon" reference).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the vendor achieves Earned Stasis through distributing weight rather than erasing it - "she had learned to distribute its weight—parcel it out in measured doses, trade it for other people's hollows." The accumulative lens holds as seven transactions build density toward this realization. Cost is visible in the ledger's arithmetic of loss and the vendor's ongoing burden, though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught memory-tasting that builds to the coral pavilion's collective remorse being transformed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira emerges "hollowed but whole," having absorbed and smoothed the stored grief, with clear cost ("the contagion spent"). The tidal pool analysis method provides consistent internal logic, though the mechanics could be slightly more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the grain elevator's transformation from silence to sanctuary, with clear cost in Elara abandoning her typical librarian duties for this mission. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as languages layer and voices harmonize toward communal restoration. Orientation anchors clearly (Elara, tower, night mission) and the closure lands with "earned sunrise" and the weight left as promise, though the rapid town transformation strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the engineer's final stance crystallizes as she commits to ongoing modification work with "eyes wet but unblinking." The cost is felt through physical details and emotional embodiment, though the exact nature of the synaptic plasticity remains abstract. Orientation anchors clearly (canyon, moon, engineer) and the pattern of memory-modification builds density toward the ending image of stepping "into the next bend."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elira awakens the Seed with visible cost (the chamber sealing permanently behind her). The seventh eye revelation and subsequent chamber discovery follow causal linkage. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (grotto's exact nature unclear until mid-story) though this serves the mystical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the porcelain's fractures become "conduits of connection" and the grove transforms from silence to participatory music. The cost is felt through Silas's tears of recognition and the months of hollow silence that preceded this moment. However, the thematic summary "Empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture" weakens the closure's subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's shift from anxious exile to purposeful teacher, with cost visible in years of banishment. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on reflection without sufficient present-moment pressure to fully earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara successfully unlocks the diary and preserves the silences before the fireworks destroy them. The cost is visible in her tears of reverence and the urgency of working "before the world shattered them with noise." However, the stakes could be more visceral—we understand conceptually what's at risk but don't feel the immediate pressure of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the corpse flower blooms and transforms village consciousness, with clear before/after ("Arguments dissolved into apologies"). The accumulative lens holds through sensory buildup to the bloom's revelation, though the "tide's thought" mechanism feels slightly abstract. Cost appears in villagers' initial revulsion and Elira's tears.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure: resilience reframed from growth to memory/echo, with the arrow becoming "rooted" and Elira's purpose shifting from piloting to echoing. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (dew spirals, inverted gravity, bio-resonance) toward this revelation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causal opacity around how the arrow actually functions.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure where the narrator crystallizes their stance against an adaptive threat, with the patch as compass and the wind as learner creating undeniable pressure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of wind behaviors building to the confrontational ending. Cost is felt through Varga's death and the isolation of being the sole person who understands the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the "sculpted hush" being transformed rather than shattered, with the protagonist carrying it forward. However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt—we see transformation but not what was sacrificed. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks, but the "who/where/when" anchoring arrives late (ice cavern context emerges gradually).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration ending where she becomes "keeper of thresholds" with visible cost (abandoning the flute). The piece anchors orientation clearly (Thunder-echo Range, seventeen years after guardianship) and maintains causality through her methodical approach. The closure lands with felt cost as she transforms from relic keeper to threshold keeper, leaving the flute to become "less instrument, more monument."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught density increases building to a Conceptual Repricing where the final glyph means "beginning/ending/bridge" depending on the reader's heart. Orientation anchors clearly (letterpress operator, topaz workshop, vanishing stars), and the cost is legible through the halo's dimming light "siphoned into the pamphlets." The piece teaches its pattern of borrowed identities early and pays it off when she walks away "her name still unsigned."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly with the pendant's release as Resonant Reconfiguration—she seeds wonder by letting go, with visible cost of losing her method. The pattern of "vibrating sympathetically" pays off through market scene and final dissolution. Slight dock for orientation arriving late (~150 words for full grounding).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through frost-vision revelations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mystic chooses silence over publication (Earned Stasis with visible cost). The progression from communion attempt to vision to deliberate withholding tracks causally. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (arbor location unclear) and the conceptual cost of silence being more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the spinner dissolves into the weave, her essence reaching across impossible distance at the cost of physical form. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each shuttle pass intensifies the transformation until the final "message had arrived" confirms both success and sacrifice. The amber bead's journey from orchard to city crystallizes the cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Arlo's daily ritual of weaving silk into tools builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where he transforms from vessel to source ("He had become the barter"). Cost is visible through the silk's depletion and Arlo's willing sacrifice, though the glyph's sudden permanence feels slightly convenient without clearer causality.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira discovers the truth reweights her entire existence ("some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible"). The cost is felt through her tears and the weight of knowledge. Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from shard discovery to universe crossing to truth revelation. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the "withheld truth" concept before its reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elias's act of tending transforms his grief from "sharp" to "luminescent," a genuine reconfiguration with emotional cost. The pattern of ritual acts (delivering letters, placing stones, carrying glass) accumulates toward this shift. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation and the lamp's convenient re-lighting which, while symbolically apt, lacks clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve meaningful closure—the herald simply continues her eternal routine without decisive change or reconfiguration. The "who" is established but the "where" and "when" remain vague beyond metaphorical anchors ("emerald lighthouse," "after newspapers"). Most critically, no visible cost lands on the page; the ending merely restates the opening condition with poetic flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the dye master shifts from seeking to replicate others' magnetism to cultivating her own fractures as "apertures." Cost is visible in the fabric's effect on patrons (weeping, children whispering). The lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern revelations about light's oblique angles.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the worker accepts a new role as memory-keeper, with cost visible in abandoning repair for witness. The sextant's transformation from broken to dream-projector drives the pivot naturally, though the astronomer's fate feels slightly convenient as explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing cleanly—the realm transforms from shroud to cradle through collective song, with visible cost in the keeper's weeping recognition. The mica windows' transformation from prison to mirror provides clear before/after. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (greenhouse location emerges gradually) though this serves the dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira transforms exile into sanctuary through self-acceptance, with clear cost (seven winters of isolation, risk of Society's judgment at dawn). The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward her stance crystallization. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some opacity around the Society's actual nature/purpose beyond "secret sanctum."

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the Resonant Reconfiguration of uncloaking and guerrilla gardening, with cost visible in the "armor she didn't know she carried." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off with the water stirring from hidden springs. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (who/where clarifies gradually) though this serves the meditative discovery mode.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the three vows building to forgiveness as "the most durable frequency." Cost is legible in the extinction of the slide's magic and Elira's tears. The final image of light piercing the dome while "somewhere, a vow still glowed" charges the preservation work with renewed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the watch fob's revelation, which shatters the deal without violence—the trust breaks through memory and recognition. The causal chain from failed disguises to final confrontation builds coherently. Cost is legible in the "brittle snap of trust shattering" and the dissolution of the criminal alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the skeptic's shift from doubt to trust as she learns to "carry less, taste more." The forest election system and convergence points establish consistent world rules. Cost is visible in the man's dissolution and her surrender of certainty. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "terrestrially cosmic" which never fully crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered memories and portraits materializing on cave walls, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where releasing the portraits transforms both artist and cave. Cost is visible through tears, the broken lock, and the father's softened expression. The childhood charcoal discovery provides causal linkage to the final act of drawing-to-release.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through discovery sequences toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the calligrapher becomes "the archive." Cost is visible in her physical deterioration and the weight of bearing witness. The map-following structure provides clear causality. Deduction for slightly abstract closure language ("perhaps, in time, the oasis would refill") that softens the otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward the protagonist's death and the sculpture's continuation—a valid Earned Stasis with cost. Orientation anchors clearly (bell tuner, whispering bluff, kinetic sculpture by ~100 words). The closure reweights prior material when the sculpture continues "without her," though the ghost/echo coda slightly dilutes the cost's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the caretaker's transformation from isolated maintenance to generative wholeness lands with clear cost—the burned fears, the physical grafting of garden to machine. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the burn sequence, though the magnetic shift subplot adds some diffusion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught ritual (Tuesday deposits, four-dawn humming visits) building to Leo's cathartic release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo shifts from isolation to community connection, with visible cost in his weeping. The mailbox's organic "exhale" strains credibility slightly but doesn't break the emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dance movements accumulate into system takeover, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira "vanishes—not dead, not gone, but rewritten." The cost is visible in her choosing dissolution over escape. However, the worldbuilding mechanics (Overseers, the Purge) arrive late without sufficient grounding, and some causal links between dance and technical effects strain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through reunion, with visible cost in three years of searching and the irreversible step through the gravity pocket. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns in coffee grounds, wildflowers, and gravity anomalies build toward the threshold crossing. Causality is clean: whale death → gravity fluctuations → pattern recognition → portal discovery → reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the prophecy transforms from doom to plea, and the summoner accepts her role as listener with visible cost ("She would return tomorrow, and the night after"). The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern and image density. Deducted for slight cost opacity - the emotional/physical price of this commitment could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist gains the key to truly communicate with the building, with visible cost in the years of patient waiting and coded exchanges. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the seal-to-key revelation. Orientation anchors (rooftop, neighbor, building sentience) establish cleanly by the 25% mark.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the skeptic transforms isolation into sovereignty through the act of archiving, with cost visible in "fragility wasn't weakness; it was the first draft of resilience." The accumulative structure coheres, though the middle section's abstract "resonance structures" momentarily obscures the concrete journey.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira's act releases the kingdom from inherited guilt, with visible cost (her blood, the key's dissolution, her weakened state). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the ritual building through sensory details toward transformation. Slight deduction for the convenience of the vault opening mechanism that could use stronger causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the entity transforms from predator to listener, with visible cost in the singer's raw throat and the returned resonance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through progressive shell revelations. Orientation anchors solidly (canyon, singer, starlight) though the "serpentine nexus" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where the melted snow globe transforms into a crystalline window, releasing the child's purpose and rippling into strangers' lives with visible emotional cost. The piece teaches its dream-cameo pattern early and pays it off through specific examples (fisherman, librarian, widow) that reweight the central preservation theme. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the shrine setting and the ghost whisperer's role.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the philosopher's witnessing stance crystallizes with felt cost ("vanished into the alleys"). The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains coherent pressure through pattern accumulation. Cost is legible in the ephemeral footprints and the choice to remain unseen while honoring others.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she discovers the network of stillpoints and commits to "reassembling the world's broken pieces," with cost visible in her sorrow for buried truths. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the revelation that the diamond is a "tuning fork" transforming radiation. Orientation anchors clearly (wasteland orchard, post-liquidation world) though the transition from letter fragments to orchard arrival could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira's broadcast piggybacks on Kael's signal towers, reweighting the power dynamic with clear cost (exposure to rebels finding her). The accumulative lens holds as fragmented messages build toward this harmonic transmission. Orientation anchors clearly (Elira at observatory), though the "seven winters" backstory and Kael exposition slightly dilute present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern taught early through jar-collecting, building density through townspeople's exchanges, and landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the poet's disappearance transforms him from vagrant to vessel, with the loft's humming jars as lasting cost. The music box repair sequence demonstrates clear causality through specific captured sounds awakening the mechanism, and the girl-grandmother echo provides earned closure that reweights the entire collection's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage (ice sings → key vibrates → she descends → counters attack). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (exhaustion, transformation to guardian). The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~120 words. However, the scavengers' motivations and the Heartstone's power system feel underdeveloped for the weight they carry at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through earned stasis—the mapper's patient revolution succeeds not through action but through contagion of presence, with visible cost in the old regime's silence and retreat. The accumulative structure coheres around the moon-tracking motif and magnetic resonance, though the middle third occasionally drifts into abstraction ("rage burns fast and leaves only ash").

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the investigator's transformation from routine investigator to witness-keeper, with visible cost in the tattooed names and acknowledged burden ("not lighter, but steadier"). The accumulative structure coheres as historical echoes layer into present investigation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and the abstract "memory-field rupture" explanation that momentarily breaks the otherwise grounded supernatural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the clockwork heart's successful beating mirrors Elias's acceptance of grace, with visible emotional cost paid through months of patient labor. The accumulative lens holds as technical details build toward the revelation that synchronization, not force, enables both mechanical and spiritual restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught density that culminates in the bell's stirring—a Resonant Reconfiguration where yearning transforms from algorithm to whispered promise. The cost is legible in Zeta's physical exhaustion and the seventeen-cycle wait being broken. Orientation anchors (Zeta, workshop, acid sea) establish cleanly within first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught recursion (0707) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes the crew's anchor. The cost is visible in her isolation and perpetual vigil. Minor orientation wobble around "temporal coordinates" but recovers through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist transforms from enforcer to witness, with visible cost in accepting brokenness ("It wasn't whole. It never would be. But it was enough"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as mirrors accumulate glimpses that reweight her understanding of peace. Orientation anchors (lighthouse orchard, ice floes) establish by ~120 words. Deduction for some causality softness in how mirror-glimpses mechanically work.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught listening methodology culminating in the glacier collapse as sonic epiphany. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reconceptualizes endings as "thresholds that sing," with cost visible in her near-death on the ice floe and subsequent life redirection.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through vineyard metaphors building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where both accept their "destined mismatch" as fertile ground. The cost is visible in seven years of separation and the "chasm" becoming "a vineyard row—fertile, intentional, alive." Orientation anchors (pavilion, vineyard, autumn) land early and the closure reweights their failed love as meaningful precisely because of difference.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through conjured clearings that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the pavilion achieves sanctity through surrender. The orientation anchors (pavilion, after prophet, desert setting) establish by ~100 words. Cost is visible in "muscles humming with spent focus" and the permanence of preservation. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of some causal links between clearings and preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated images of healing and transformation, with the dove-gray case among lavender serving as the final charged image. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we see the archivist's devotion but no sacrifice or foreclosed path, and the "one quiet arc at a time" feels more like assertion than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with density increasing through layered descriptions of decay, method, and memory until the crystal's question triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration. The scholar's shift from transcriber to participant lands with clear cost—abandoning years of silent method. The who/where/when anchors establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory ghosts until the prophet finally captures "the sound of growing older"—a tidal, rhythmic longing. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: he accepts perpetual forgetting while maintaining his ritual, with cost visible in trembling body and erasure by dew. The fog reshaping into rocking chair/swing set/nothing crystallizes impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when time "braids" rather than flows linearly, with visible cost in Elira's "luminous ache" and crystallized tears. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from spinning hand to falling leaf to final mosaic vision, though the mechanism of restructuring time through sound strains plausibility even within the established fantastic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's hymning building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where souls connect through shared mundane memories. The closure lands with visible transformation as "souls reached out, not to her, but to each other," showing cost through the dissolution of the vinyl shard. Orientation anchors clearly (Elara, heaven-like haven, after death), though the transition from earthly to spiritual realm could be more causally explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira becomes the threshold keeper, with clear cost (transformation of self). The accumulative/textural lens holds as nightly rituals build toward understanding. Who/where/when anchored early ("floating isle of Vaelis," "observatory," post-spoon world). The seventeen-night progression creates coherent escalation toward the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the tooth becoming a "marker" that transforms the garden into a site of collective healing. The cost is legible in "the ache of a child's first loss" and the community's future pilgrimages with "fragments," though the orientation (who/where/when) could anchor more concretely in the opening 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where polishing transforms grief into shared light, with visible cost ("knees creaking," years of exile). The accumulative lens holds consistently through memory layers and rhythmic action. The transformation from "earthbound star watcher" to light-sharer lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly through Earned Stasis - she's "not fixed" but "becoming," with visible cost in the public confession's transformation. The accumulative lens holds as moss patterns, drip marks, and amber echoes build toward the final image of "protected vulnerability." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise: the novelist accepts her unfinished manuscript as "pulsing with potential" rather than desperation, paying the cost of conventional closure. The accumulative structure coheres as ghostly encounters build toward her method of "transmutation" rather than "transcription," though the cost could be more visceral in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds density through layered musical imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the arbor transforms into living song. The closure lands with visible cost: generations of lost practice acknowledged through the apparitions' bow to earth. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words. The vine's transformation from tendril to wreath provides coherent arc under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through ritual placement leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the alchemist becomes a living conduit for the pulse-map. The copper plate's transformation and her chest-warming integration create visible cost through blood sacrifice and physical endurance in permafrost, with the wolf's recognition confirming the change.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the "larder for the soul" that future travelers discover, with visible cost in the abandoned village above. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern-teaching (light angles, emotional temperature classifications). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 with character, setting, and timeframe. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off, though the conceptual cost could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis—the weaver's acceptance of perpetual duty with visible cost ("Not to be free. But to endure."). The accumulative structure coheres through the calcification metaphor, building density toward the final image. Orientation anchors clearly (bronze grotto, fractal weaver, after snowmelt). Slight dock for the predictable visitor arrival pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Earned Stasis closure lands with cost as Eleanor accepts grief's rhythm rather than conquering it, shown through the carved lion "eyes closed not in death, but in trust." The accumulative structure coheres through the carving's progression, though heavy reflection (>30%) occasionally abstracts the present frame, particularly in passages about Viktor's philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the final Conceptual Repricing ("You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it") landing with clear conceptual cost. The chronological confusion is taught early and pays off through the layered memory contradictions, though orientation of the physical space remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered interventions (steam redirection, sextant mounting, kinetic tiles) that build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the terminal "learns how to breathe again." Cost is visible in the terminal's persistent decay ("walls still cracked") and Elira's ongoing commitment. The equation H = Σ(ΔI • R) provides conceptual closure but feels slightly forced; the piece would be stronger letting the accumulated details speak without the formula.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elias transforms from measuring seconds to "measuring peace," with cost visible in accepting his reduced artistic scope. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the crystal's arrival feels slightly convenient despite the rain's preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the locket discovery and inscription reveal, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where understanding replaces pursuit. The cost is legible in "carrying not proof, but peace"—a foreclosed path to traditional legend-seeking. Orientation anchors clearly (seeker, canal, twilight) and the pattern of patience-over-action teaches early through the sundial consultation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching through knot-learning building to the resonant "collecting hands" reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost—the commitment to return "when fog rolls again." The fulgurite-as-offering initiates trust; each knot deepens connection until the final promise crystallizes the relationship's future.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the traveler's method of "mapping absence to make the gone gloriously present," with the thread as a persistent constraint. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early and maintains coherence, though the cost at closure could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where beauty stirs without requiring the egg to hatch—the world itself reawakens. The cost is legible in years of mockery, isolation, and uncertain outcome. Orientation anchors clearly (prince, suspended palace, mechanical world below) and causality holds as his assembled genesis tunes the world's frequency back to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with the lagoon ritual serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration where acceptance replaces erasure, showing clear cost in the line "Not to fix, not to bury, but to listen." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through kelp/tide imagery and pays it off when she runs toward fire "with kelp-drift peace." Orientation anchors solidly by line three, though the obsidian figure's emergence pushes against clarity without quite breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the first fountain's single drop crystallizes the city's transformation. The accumulative structure coheres well—each fountain visit builds toward liberation with clear cost (the city's "defiant hush" replacing absence). Orientation anchors by ~120 words. The lens holds consistently as textural accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the gear transforms from calculating to radiating, breaking the generational pattern. Cost is visible in the "troubling serenity" of gentle change that "might never be noticed." Orientation anchors (nebula garden, sentimentalist, gear) establish by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with ribbons accumulating meaning until the final crimson one triggers Silas stepping forward—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms to accompanied practice. Cost is felt through grandmother's memory loss and the weight of collective mourning. Slight deduction for the abstract "grief geometry" section that momentarily breaks texture.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias shifts from clock-winder to witness, with visible cost in releasing his life's purpose. The accumulative structure builds through obsidian ridge, pendulum, and rake handle to crystallize in his barefoot stance "no longer counting seconds, but savoring." The wife's inscription arrives late but pays off by recontextualizing forty-three years of service; orientation anchors clearly by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the gardener's perception fundamentally shifts. The descent into the silo, untangling of threads, and return to the cemetery create clear progression, though the middle section's revelations about buried letters and silent sacrifices feel somewhat disconnected from the opening's cemetery work. Cost is visible in her recognition of "silences she'd kept, love she'd trimmed" but could be more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through the final realization that "True transformation sustains itself not by perfection, but by permeability." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with each glyph building pressure toward the spire's final pulse of recognition. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible in the acceptance of misreading and rebellion as necessary prices.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she becomes broadcaster rather than receiver, with visible cost in her tears and waiting. The accumulative structure coheres through the radio's secret glow as persistent constraint, and the pattern-teaching of dust-to-story resurrection justifies the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with density increases around the powder ritual and the rocking chair's stillness charging the final configuration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the visiting woman leaves "lighter somehow" and the scatterer sits in the now-still chair—cost is felt through "weight she didn't know she carried." Orientation anchors clearly (gallery, dusk, protagonist established early). Deduction for the cost being somewhat oblique rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the philosopher's endurance creates meaning through sedimentary accumulation against the Council's erasure. The final image of him transcribing erosion patterns while the Council unveils "Forward Without Looking Back" crystallizes the cost of his choice. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2-3. Deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Elara's patient waiting transforms into active teaching with the student's arrival, making her years of "expectant resignation" meaningful. The cost (decades of showing up without applause) is visible throughout. Deducted for late orientation of the concrete present action and heavy reflection ratio that delays narrative anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of the greenhouse from decay to "quiet potential," with visible cost in her nightly commitment to tend. The accumulative lens holds as memories layer and the knowledge fruit grows sideways, creating resonance rather than resolution. Orientation anchors clearly (chef, greenhouse, celestial alignment), and the piece teaches its pattern of memory-as-taste early, though some causality around synaptic plasticity remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the revelation that the tower "collects belief" rather than lightning, reweighting all prior riddles and matchboxes as acts of faith-preservation. The causal chain from blackout → drone migration → tower charging → belief collection lands cleanly with visible cost in the city's misunderstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory detail until the orris root's placement triggers a resonant reconfiguration—the cottage's ghost unclenches. Closure lands through Earned Stasis as she accepts her role as perpetual sanctifier. Cost is visible in the dissolved shard and the cottage's release, though the exact stakes of "creeping normality" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration—the statue's dissolution into plankton while the historian surfaces with new purpose. The accumulative lens holds as each revelation layers meaning, though the "cascading revelations" feel slightly orchestrated rather than inevitable. Cost is visible in the statue's dissolution and the historian's transformed mission.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the die vanishes and he carries "the captured texture of what he'd missed—not to mourn it, but to weave it." The accumulative structure coheres through mathematical proofs, the die's evolution, and the staircase's recursive nature, with visible cost in the "rough velvet of indecision" he must carry forward.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly with pattern-teaching early (glyphs, moon-brush, transmissions) and meaningful deepening through density increase. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the teenager joins the painter, creating visible change with implied cost (isolation ended, responsibility shared). The waxing moon progression provides coherent temporal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's transformation from frozen grief to active art-making, with visible cost in the "daily kneading of hope into dough." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered artistic revivals. Minor orientation delays (grotto's exact nature) and some causality softness in middle transitions prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clockmaker breaks fate but assumes its burden—a clear before/after with visible cost ("carried its weight alone"). The causal chain from yoyo discovery to hunger stone activation to temporal reversal holds logically. The paradox of receiving a gear from his future self adds complexity without breaking causality. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the protagonist's specific goal.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from resuscitation to funhouse confrontation to fear's dissolution, with visible cost (extracting traumatic memories). The closure lands as a Decisive Change with the protagonist defeating fear through recognition. Orientation anchors established early ("abandoned carnival funhouse"). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating density—from cloud interpretation to wave-xylophone to fruit-seed percussion—culminating in Kael's transformation that alters the generating algorithm. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as "the tide turned—not away, but inward," showing irrevocable change with felt cost (exhaustion). Orientation anchors firmly by ~100 words with Prophet, orchard, blue hour established.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking closure when the watcher turns—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights all prior observation. Cost is legible in becoming "another name whispered through reed whistles at dusk," though the final choice to climb lacks immediate on-page consequence beyond declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (ivy/roots as time's erosion, petal drop marking transition) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the historian chooses measured revelation over explosive truth. The cost is legible in "no triumph in her stride, only resolve" and the acknowledgment that truth-telling means accepting being called "a revisionist." The piece teaches its reflective mode early and anchors each reflection to the physical letter, though some middle passages lean abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered note-placements building to the bride's letter discovery and Elara's transformation. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with visible cost—the emptied inkwell and Elara feeling "lighter—not hollow, but clarified."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: the ritual → tape discovery → placement → staff recognition → posted notice lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Closure cost is felt (she remains hidden, risking slow hunger for recognition) and options reweight around “visibility without spectacle.” Orientation is clean early; no causality hiccups. The cost is subtle rather than biting, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear single‑POV arc with an accumulative/situational lens: observation → intent to cut → release → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost (destroyed journal, abdication of old posture) and a charged final image. The bioluminescent response tracks as consequence of her surrender within the story’s logic. A hairline convenience remains in the instantaneous “leaf waits for her” reveal, but causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative structure teaches its pattern early and pays off: discovery → dream/trace → journal → exchange. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the tide‑line trade alters her options (sleep returns; the brooch and journal are gone). Causality is clean and object‑driven; the rain trail and journal discovery motivate the decisive act. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when) and the lens holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean from the outset (clairvoyant in a musical crystal cave; a pilgrim arrives), and the pattern of sound/shadow intensifies to a cadence shift. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the forces redefined as part of the magic, punctuated by the pearl’s pulse and darkening. The cost is present but subtle (relinquishing control/predictive certainty), keeping this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: interviews → patterning → proposal → communal rite. Closure lands on the page with cost and a felt before/after—the town’s practice changes and loss is ritualized rather than erased. Orientation is clean from the first line; no lens ambiguity. The trumpet valve centering the chart and the rite provides a crisp on‑page cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of arrows → door → whisper‑detonation builds coherently to a conceptual repricing: the “fortress” is a chorus absorbed, not a place entered. Closure lands on the page with cost (the punch dissolves; self is “unraveled/remade”). Orientation is clean from the opening line, and the final silver needle image locks the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear single-scene arc with an accumulative lens: whale song → synchronization → conceptual reweighting of the tile as conduit. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis. The cost is present but quiet, rooted in her refusal to “solve” and acceptance of a service role. A bolder on-page pinch (risk or lost option) would have pushed this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: storm → magnetic crescendo → spatial mutiny → gateway → crossing. Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the escondite collapses, and he irrevocably steps into the “resonance” plain. Setups (magnetism, amulet’s nature) pay off cleanly without late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly: active waiting → opening the ink → testing it on a predatory contract → communal recalibration → charged exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the child commits to a nonviolent reckoning with the father, with cost signaled by the half-empty ink and ongoing duty. Orientation is crisp early (prep room, midnight), and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds to the end. The causal steps inside the scene remain coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: pattern of listening/noting deepens until the “Unknown Era” breaks it open. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she invites others by leaving the notepad, accepting a cost in control and authorship. Orientation is strong from the start; stakes tighten with the new resonance and returning footsteps. The price is legible in the final image and coheres with the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative structure is clean: the port labyrinth, satchel fragments, label, shoe vigil, and tide rhythm build toward a charged poise ending. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and the pattern is taught and kept. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to the work “until the tide took him or until the world admitted...” with conceptual cost. A decisive mid‑piece tightening is soft, but the cumulative deepening suffices for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetitions (retell → hum → compass) densify until the decisive repricing—“the core of her own silence.” Closure lands on-page with cost: the shell cracks, the compass dissolves, and she exits having renounced the prior drive. Orientation is crisp from line one, and the single-scene structure tightens without drift. The price persists into the final image (living beside riddles, not solving).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: small reorganizing acts accrete toward the final mural and communal mobilization. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a coherent before/after (private takeover vs communal re-claiming). The “final contract due” beat tightens the pattern into a decisive act. Cost is legible but modestly scaled (privatization stalls, not ends), just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative drive tightens around the 05:00 clock and the dawn thermal spike; closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate; cause/effect holds from the chemical design to the final grain. The cost is conceptual and felt: she witnesses a message no one can receive, then labels and departs. A minimal on‑page reversal keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene accumulative design holds cleanly: the clock (anchor) tightens, the refractive method recalibrates, and the drone’s flight completes a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the closure image (orchids unfurling as the horn sounds) lands on‑page. Cost is present but modest, with no meaningful setback before success. Still, causality is coherent and the closure effect is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: falcon’s fragment → condensation ritual → trek to ice → spoken seventeenth translation → spiral. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the “source” becomes a moment of alignment, enacted by the pen’s spiral and the refusal to claim it with a flag. Cost is legible as renunciation of glory and the end of a long hunt, reweighted in the line “worrying tranquility—replaced by something quieter, deeper.” Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and sustained without slips.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: the ritual walk densifies until a counterpoint emerges and the town hums. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page markers (rain, bell, arch knitting, fork placed) and a conceptual price (she cedes tool and presence). Orientation is immediate and stable. The cost is subtle rather than wrenching, preventing a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres from approach to activation to surrender. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—the vial shatters by “purpose,” reweighting rescue vs. resonance with visible cost (her death). Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint (oxygen clock) shapes the ending image (distress signal blinking out).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive holds: entry → discovery → insertion → summoning → sealing, each beat narrowing options. Closure is on-page and costly: he traps the witnesses in the lens and forecloses being believed in person, shifting truth into the lighthouse’s beam (a Conceptual Repricing with Earned Stasis notes). Orientation is clear early (lighthouse prison, reef, dusk), and the “before they find the bodies” clock is paid off by the search party’s arrival. No teleports or unkept setups; the lattice’s property is seeded and used.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: patterns (cameos, bead resonance, orchard sleep) intensify toward a clear RR closure when burden becomes heritage. Causality is legible within the lyric frame: appearance → transfer → infusion → awakening. Cost is on-page in the bride’s unraveling and permanent reconfiguration of the orchard’s state. Orientation is early and clean; no lens wobble at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: stitching deepens pressure as the environment responds, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the plate pulses and the storm/child animate. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the final vow (“return tomorrow…until the canyon remembered how to sing”) functions as closure with conceptual cost. Cost is more implied than dramatized—no hard obstacle opposes her in-scene—slightly softening impact. Nonetheless, the cadence shift is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries accrete toward the sundial’s reorientation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when shadows align and the orchard “chimes.” Causality is coherent—her purposeful wandering leads to context, which enables the final fit. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (diaspora ended; faith re‑tuned), though the price is more elegiac than sharply felt. Orientation is clear early (who/where/aim), with one continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds cleanly to a Charged Poise closure: she consecrates delay and ephemerality as the price of depth. Orientation is early and firm; the clipboard, arcade, and mission are clear by ~120 words. The “widow’s message” beat gives present-tense aim that binds reflection to action. Cost is legible but mostly conceptual; no decisive turn narrows options beyond the chosen method’s built‑in fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: flame shudders → synchronization → adjacent-layer reconnaissance → counter‑stitching → coup falters. Orientation lands immediately and holds; the lens remains causal through closure. The cost is implied (exhaustion, seizure of her workspace, risk) rather than dramatized as a concrete loss, but the decisive reconfiguration (“adjacent possibilities collapsed into one: hers”) is on‑page. Tight, legible architecture for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and ritual actions coherently escalate toward a Charged Poise closure. Closure lands on the page with cost—the letters dissolve, the shard is relinquished, and a new path opens—reweighting the premise without mechanistic tying off. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when/aim). The persistent price (moonlight healing erodes memory) shadows tactics and enriches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres: discovery of the cast → decryption → spoken ritual → visual reconfiguration → stance shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes pain as kinship with an on‑page image (the cast’s knots releasing, coral cooling). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the anesthetic constraint holds through to the end. Cost is legible as acceptance over repair, though the pressure is quiet rather than forceful.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery at dawn → oral histories → noon projection → communal response → reconfigured aim. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible price—the renunciation of “preservation” for rediscovery—on the page. Orientation is clean early; causal links are coherent and pay off at the projection and its aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery of reflected method → inward spiral chime → layered awakenings → mural’s migration into her. Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (loss of the nickel; identity relinquished; new constraint within her body). The causal chain is tight within the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens: planting → Dr. Vex’s recognition/help → communal uptake → charged final poise. The key on‑page turn is Vex’s decision to aid after the lullaby trigger; closure lands as a charged poise/CR with social cost implied. Stakes are legible, though the climax leans forecast (children singing later) over an immediate decisive act. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: recurring rituals tighten toward the postcard’s new line (“They’re listening. Keep singing.”) that reweights option and stakes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she remains sleepless yet alters song (psalm) with renewed purpose, cost intact. Orientation is crisp from the start (poet, shell, post‑war reef) and the ending image recasts prior beats without mechanical wrap‑up. The persistent constraint (insomnia, fear of audience) shapes the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the routine ascends to a focused ritual (naming Veyra) and resolves in a charged dawn image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she reaffirms covenant with the cracked chime, accepting the cost of preservation without resurrection. Orientation is crisp early, and constraints (no restoration; cracked aperture; wind as agent) shape tactics throughout. The cost is legible in “tending emptiness like a garden” and the renunciatory satisfaction of a vow kept.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: research → discovery of harmonic promises → choral test → charged silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: awe‑silence and prismatic ink denote a before/after with conceptual cost and a path forward. Because/therefore sequencing is intact, with on‑page consequences (chiming inkwell, chandelier tone, environmental response). The price is largely conceptual rather than punitive, but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: envelope glue → ash → amphitheater harmonics → decision to embed mercy into systems. Orientation is crisp from the opening and sustained through a single scene with a clean exit image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a plan to recalibrate with risk and a reweighted mission. The cost is conceptual and social more than immediate; still effective but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the meteorite discovery → mapping dust → harness redesign → Argent’s song → the letter arriving. Closure is an on‑page resonant reconfiguration with cost: she abandons her protective self‑forgeries and leaves the ledgers open. Setups (paper trails, skylight dust, pigeons) pay off cleanly without retroactive patches. The sequence reads motivated rather than coincidental, with one deepening turn sufficing at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bench → logbook → vision of maze → step into threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with cost (“not falling, but unfolding”), legible on the page. Causal links are mostly internal and symbolic yet coherent; the logbook reveal of her handwriting efficiently tightens options. A hair of convenience in the instantaneous maze sighting keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: image density builds to the fireflies’ schematic spiral and the open‑hand formation, culminating in a charged poise moment. Closure lands on the page with a felt reconfiguration—she leaves with belonging intact—while the feather cooling and sunrise seal the before/after. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no orientation debt. Cost is subtle (accepting solitude and departing the moment), yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres toward a conceptual repricing at the crater glass. Who/where/when are crisply anchored early; the drive lens holds through closure. The realization that “missing pieces were given away” reconfigures the goal into stewardship with on‑page follow‑through (gathering seeds, pendant). Cost is present but subtle; no causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the scene builds from setup to Act II cue to a charged final image (last coin heads‑up by the bishop). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—Elias remains in his “cathedral,” affirmed yet still choosing attention over applause. Causality is patterned by his orchestration of chance rather than linear turns, and the pattern is taught and kept. The cost is conceptual and quiet (refusal of grandeur; devotion to the in‑between) rather than overtly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the find → fusion → grueling dance → communal witness culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—blood, fatigue—and a conceptual repricing (“the nostalgia ban still ruled—but no longer reigned”). Orientation is clean from the outset. The moonstone’s discovery edges toward coincidence but is integrated through the “gaps” method, preserving coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual (rings/prism) builds to a quiet reconfiguration as he carries “noctilucent reckonings” into day and chooses Widow Hargrove’s window. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and pattern remains coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing, though cost is subtle (misunderstanding, aging body). No causal turns, but the density/cadence shift is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the recurring act of reading/answering builds to the charged decision to leave his own unsigned letter and walk on. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a vow to carry rather than bury, the box lighter through loss shared. Cost is legible on the page (grief kept, not erased; a continued burden accepted). Orientation is clean from the opening sentence; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: create → launch → observe → recalibrate culminates in the resonance cascade and small multiversal shifts. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the obsidian disc and needle swing reweight the system and options. Cost is implicit (ongoing, relentless labor without finale) rather than explicit on-page loss, slightly softening impact. Orientation is clean from the opening (grotto, gauge, trial balloons), and set-ups pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the bend, the diaries, the witnessing, and the moonlit negative tighten meaning toward a resonant offering. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she deposits her sketch with the diaries and leaves with a heavier heart. Cost is legible and on-page (she foregoes pinning the image and relinquishes her map). Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the single-scene structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: song → prism → mirrors reconfigure → relinquishment. Closure lands as a charged poise: she returns the heartbeat and leaves, foreclosing attachment; the tolling bell seals a before/after. Cost is conceptual but clear—self‑erasure and non‑possession are the price of her work. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: solitary preparation → ritual writing → communal signing → dawn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: peace is mustered, not won; cost is her sustained return and the imperfect mosaic of prints. Orientation is clean from the opening and causal throughline never breaks. The on‑page cost is conceptual/emotional rather than tactical, but it’s legible at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: setup → ritual → resonance → relinquishment culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Who/where/when are anchored early; the luminous cracks and thinning thunder escalate to a charged final image. The cost is on-page (forgoing possession and accepting future ruthlessness). No causality breaks; each move coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres; each untangled thread advances toward a clean closure when the last knot dissolves and the echoes release. Causality is rhythmic rather than plotty but holds: patience → partial releases → final recognition line triggers opening. The cost is conceptual and social more than visceral, yet legible through the Court and her chosen solitude. Orientation is clear early; the lens stays Accumulative/Textural through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: present‑tense rehearsal frame interleaves charged past beats toward a Charged Poise closure (earned serenity; intent to face Mira through art). Orientation is crisp from the opening; the stick and candle recur to scaffold causality. The cost is implied (risking rejection, abandoning lucrative moral evasion) rather than enacted, but it’s legible in the final poise. One tightening turn—the bottle incident reframed as punctuation—reweights the present stance effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: ritual actions layer toward the monarch’s benediction and her refusal. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she bows and withdraws, foreclosing touch and possession, with the cost legible on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the opening lines, and the final image reweights the premise. The rain/wind dissolution forecast ties the structure to cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught and held: find card, rebraid rope, cast, sound the helix, embed and depart. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (half‑unraveled relic, leaving the helix, self‑erasure). Causality is coherent within the ritual logic; no teleporting props. The only limit is the low external pressure—stakes deepen but rarely pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm → induced dream → symbol logic → epiphany → removal of the seal → collapse. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing (“You were always the path”) with the bunker’s surrender mirroring hers. Orientation is clean early; stakes stay coherent. Cost is present but primarily conceptual, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens toward Sirius’s descent and the tile’s hum, then resolves in a charged refusal to sensationalize (wrap, leave, return later). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: confirmation without spectacle reweights the covenant. Causality is steady (preparation → alignment → activation → preservation), with the cost seeded and carried. A hair shy of 9+ due to the low external counterforce, though the accumulative lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: silence, shifting walls, and the broken pin accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration as the melody internalizes. Closure lands on‑page with cost—the tool is retired as a “relic of surrender.” Orientation is clean from the outset and maintained. The beat architecture is simple yet coherent, avoiding outliney sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: breath → resonance → approach → capture. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act (the dream flows into the mirror) and a conceptual cost (final craft, boundary erasure that reconfigures her role). Orientation is strong from the opening; no causality breaks. Cost is more conceptual than bruising, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from scavenging to a charged retrieval (the daughter’s fresh vow) to a reweighted final image (footprints and green scrap). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she recommits to a costly path with new, specific hope rather than resolution. Causality is clean at the scale: honey → vow → stitching → sleep/dream → footprints → renewed ascent with “honey, thread, and hope.” The cost remains live on the page; reconciliation is not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orchard → bathroom inquiry → re-entry with reweighted rules, culminating in a resonant repricing of “inheritance” and self. Closure lands on the page via the word “Again,” the petal-visions of alternate selves, and the final charged walk—cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; pattern is taught and paid off. Slightly low external resistance keeps it from absolute top-tier but structure is taut and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative pressure culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: rescue becomes reconciliation, and the mountain responds. Orientation is clean early; causal beats thread well (arrival → discovery → listening → offering → message → reconfiguration). Closure lands on the page via the lexicon’s sentence and environmental reset; cost is conceptual (foregoing extraction, subsuming into the library). A slightly clearer on‑page consequence for Elira would elevate the decisiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds from prow to garden, with clear spatial progression and one deepening turn at the engine‑room descent. Closure lands on‑page as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she takes the name with the risk of fracture, reconfiguring options. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what) and world rules are learned through action (card opens the stair). The cost is legible in the hesitation beat and the fog’s “granting passage” seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single‑scene causal chain is clean: seal → braid reconfiguration → clock’s reset → door dissolves → archival logging. Closure reads as resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the anomaly disappears because meaning has been integrated. Orientation is crisp early; the accumulative/textural lens holds. The only shortfall is limited price paid; the victory is nearly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens from cacophony to tuned balance, culminating in releasing the hush to the largest being. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (storm tuned, not banished) with a concrete pivot on the page. Cost is modest but legible—the stone’s stored hush is surrendered—making a before/after meaningful. Orientation is clean and the one-scene structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive tightens from setup to the on‑page reconfiguration that the beacon is a receiver and she a conduit. Orientation is clean by ~120 words; star‑tracking and prism placement pay off causally. Closure carries cost via fragility (“one misaligned star…”) and the earned, careful handling at dawn. The cadence shift at Cassiopeia’s arrival and the prism’s heartbeat provide a decisive on‑page reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration: the Arch’s “impossibly short” shadow reframes time and culminates in her chosen stance of erasure and descent. Orientation is crisp from the opening. The cost is legible on the page (“did not look back,” hush internalized; vellum pulsing with ghosts).

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: chant → navigation by ambient awareness → footfall cipher → chord → star. Closure is on the page with cost: the rag is surrendered and the fortress seals, reweighting options after. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and supports the end. The persistent constraint (a night with no stars) shapes tactics and pays off in the cracked-cloud star.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “You don’t have to decide tonight.” Orientation is immediate; one continuous scene coheres. The ending’s cost—choosing suspension—lands on the page and reweights prior material (cicada/thresholds). Small risk: the decision’s external stakes remain softly sketched, but the closure still reads felt and concrete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of curated vs wild silence accrues until the closure image reprices “security.” Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration—an on‑page refusal to return and a sideways fall into a charged garden. Cost is legible (leaving father/security for risk and unknown); the gravity‑inversion coincidence sets the stage but does not resolve the conflict. Orientation is clean from the bunker into sky; cadence tightens as the hour wanes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of sound‑texture and storm‑glass responses builds to a Charged Poise closure as he welcomes the rage‑trembling man. Orientation is clean early and the single‑scene flow is coherent. The cost is quiet but present—his ongoing readiness and the woman’s release with a visible before/after. The reprise of “work continues” reweights meaning without flattening it into moral.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: decode murals → locate hatch → descend → sit → choose; sunrise pressure coheres the arc. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing with cost (orchard erased, flake spent, identity reweighted). Orientation is firm early and remains legible through the descent and return. One tightening (reality frays near sunrise) effectively narrows options without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via pattern (silence, scars, threshold) to a charged reconfiguration as the door surrenders and the lantern field replaces the room. Closure lands with cost—no reunion, the ring clattering, and a forward step that forecloses the old petitioning posture. Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups (doorknocker, threshold) pay off precisely. The constraint of silence shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: glitch texts → convergence night → anchoring with the bolt → crystallized lattice → charged morning after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost made legible when she channels betrayals into the seam. Orientation is clear early (mushroom farm beneath a tunnel) and the pattern pays off. The causal spine is simple but coherent and avoids soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene causal build lands a resonant reconfiguration: spinning the cylinder reveals identity, reweighting the mission and options. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the world rule (resonant gramophone) is seeded before use. Cost is implied (mission inversion, personal upheaval) rather than dramatized, but the ending’s charged poise is clear. The lens holds as a causal→textural hybrid, dominated by causal at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned movement deepens pressure until the thread‑descent and harmonization reconfigure meaning. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and carried through one continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual price (self as conduit, old self foreclosed). A sharper on‑page price would push it higher, but the cadence shift is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive lands a resonant reconfiguration: the button reframes the room’s purpose and the archivist’s role, validated by the supervisor’s response. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the pattern (reading dust, cataloging tenderness) is taught and paid off. Cost is emotional and conceptual rather than kinetic, but it’s on the page. The causal throughline from button → research → “Magnifications” → institutional uptake reads tight.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal flow: puddle‑map → hatch → Archive Engine → broadcast → enforcers. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—truth reenters the public sphere—though the on‑page cost remains conceptual more than personal. Orientation is clean from the opening. A single scene arc with one meaningful tightening (sirens/blackout) coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density rises (fog thickens, colors dim), culminating in the prism’s silent shatter and the prophecy’s dissolution. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when), and each move organically tightens pressure. Closure lands on-page with a conceptual cost—erasure over victory, a hush that must remain unbroken—anchored by the final dewdrop. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical, but consistent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → method shift → arbor’s deliberate reply → apparition and repricing (“prophecy is the past”). Orientation is clear early, and the beats build coherently. Closure lands on the page with the grandmother’s emergence and the charged recognition of responsibility. The cost is more conceptual (carrying others’ griefs) than dramatized, but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: coincidences → compass → descent → revelation → renunciation → re‑entry. Closure lands as conceptual repricing with cost (the watch) and a reconfigured vocation (“Tinkerer of Lost Directions”). Orientation is clear from the outset; transitions are legible and pay off. The final cadence coherently reframes prior beats without loose ends.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual steps intensify until the coin’s saturation/cracking and shattering produce on‑page closure. Cost is legible—she sacrifices the coin and accepts luminous regret as an ongoing price. Orientation is clean from the opening (foundry, after the search party). The ending’s reconfiguration (vial, new name, golden seam) lands with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: approach → confessions accrete → harmonization → laughter integration → charged departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the gorge’s melody softens and the ghosts integrate, with the price felt in “not lighter, but fuller.” Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when). No causality slips; the tool and environment pay off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and patterned callbacks (bracing, violet ripples, the strap) tighten to a Conceptual Repricing at the clearing. Closure lands when the strap is offered and dissolves, reweighting identity and the math/mercy premise with a felt cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the forest’s rule (resonance with pain) stays consistent. A hairline deduction for the openly stated thesis line that slightly reduces the need for the image to do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: market → acquisition/payment → activation/reveal → handoff → return/new commission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lens reveals witnesses and then dims, the narrator returns it and accepts a new charge; the cost (paid memory; relinquishing the lens) is legible. Orientation is crisp early, and set‑ups (Mara’s condition, the triptych) pay off. The cadence tightens cleanly toward dawn and twilight beats without causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → dust spiral → ceiling reveal → apparition → charged exit. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he affirms his role as witness; the building’s “vigil” reframes the haunt. Causality is coherent and props are earned; no teleports. Stakes remain intimate, but the final cadence shift carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: frost pattern → uncorking → rupture → aperture → selection → reconfigured library. Closure lands on page with cost—the library’s equilibrium is broken—and the final placement in “The Grammar of Collapse” seals the new stasis. The accumulative/textural lens holds and pays off through the density shift of moments into an object. No orientation debt; before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative drive holds: storms → veiled mirrors → stable glyphs → collaborative transcription. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: rebellion reframed as memory‑keeping, with the final haiku sealing a before/after. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of prior identity and in courting academic/political backlash. Orientation is clear from the outset; pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive holds: wilt → truth-seeking → song → embedding → reclaimed light. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the acceptance of guilt and a new vow—and the midnight clock pays off on the page. No causality breaks; each step flows from prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the compass ritual → inversions in the lagoon → journal → offering → sealing passage. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses inwardness; the stone sealing behind her makes the cost legible. Orientation is clean from the first line, and set-ups (compass, Seventh Descent) pay off. Slight deduction because the cost remains more conceptual than dramatized through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the slide vision → carving → projection → teaching choice → communal uptake. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she abandons ownership/market path for communal stewardship. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the brief “days later” shard pays off the pattern without breaking coherence. All set-ups (slide, projector, arch) pay off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: postcards → cathedral glass → return mural → nocturnal vigil. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses lifelong wakefulness and secrecy, paying with solitude and vigilance. Orientation is clean from the outset; the method and motifs tighten toward the final image. The cost is legible in the line “She left… her satchel lighter, her heart heavier with purpose.”

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: from mute lagoon → message‑making → phosphorescent response → chosen witnesshood. Orientation is crisp from the opening image; the zeppelin/lagoon axis never wavers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she accepts being “trapped” as witness and shifts the library’s function. The cost (ongoing binding, sleeplessness, relinquished institutional language) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: the pattern of nightly lantern emergences tightens and reweights stakes, culminating in a communal reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: revival as collective working memory rather than a return, with the bottle’s transfer crystallizing the before/after. Causality reads as because/therefore in a lyric mode (bottle → child → first lantern → gathering → shared authorship). Cost is legible (the town’s “soul” spent; the alchemist’s renunciation of control), though not dramatized in a sharp scene turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: foghorn silence → orchard ascent → immersion → prophecy revelation → activation → city seeding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes archiving into reintroduction of stored emotions with a new operational plan (“Cycle One”). Causality is clean; anchors are clear from the opening. The cost is subtle (risk and responsibility) rather than dramatized as immediate consequence, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres: acorn cap → dais insertion → entropy’s weeping reversal → sapling. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a before/after cadence shift and conceptual cost (surrender/consent). Orientation is clean from the outset; the lens holds. Cost is real but gently rendered, keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: careful setup, tremble feint, then the toll as closure. The “zero hour” cadence marks a charged poise where prediction meets presence, with the Great False Dawn backstory providing a stakes frame. Causality is clean: sensors → criteria → bell action. Cost is primarily conceptual (risk of silence until true alignment), understated but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ritual sweeping → visitor comet → efflorescence → earned stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reaffirms the vocation with a reweighted stillness after witnessing the comet’s surrender. Orientation is clean early (where/who/what), and the single scene with reflective braids stays legible. The cost is quiet but on the page (solitude, invisibility, renunciation of “glory”).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear from the outset and held: ritual, ghosts, and the box pattern toward a charged poise. Closure lands when the master beekeeper’s ghost meets her gaze and she bows—an on‑page reconfiguration that ratifies the covenant with cost. The persistent constraint (never opening the box) shapes tactics throughout and charges the final image. Orientation is clean and the cadence shift at the end is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear and held: listings → meeting → capsule response → letter → fusion → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page via the fused urn’s chime and Vey’s heart resetting, a resonant reweighting with conceptual cost. Orientation is strong from the opening image; world rules are learned through action. Minor softness in explicit cost keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the snapped string prompts a chain of presence, lullaby, and re‑making that culminates in a charged launch. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crooked kite’s flight reframes loss with a felt cost (the original kite is gone) and a reweighted premise. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph, and the motif chains pay off cleanly. The cost is conceptual more than dramatic, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure coheres: copper work → sparrow rescue → community uptake → final tying of the diary → death → legacy. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with on‑page cost (his death) and a clear before/after (personal craft becomes communal folklore). Orientation is clean early, and cause/effect holds within a lyric frame. The clock (“final month”) informs cadence without forcing contrived turns.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly: approach → waiting → resonance → renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (leaving the amber; relinquishing an isolated-equation worldview). Orientation is firm early, and the motif lattice pays off at the summit and descent. No causal slips; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: bird permissions, seed selection, ash/soil mixing, and tide cadence build to a charged poise. Closure lands in the final image—he refuses immediacy, accepts ongoing labor, and departs with attention fixed on the sown patches. The cost is endurance over time and the acceptance of slow, uncertain repair on a site of past violence. Causality is lyrical but coherent: signals → planting → resolve to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the cylinder discovery → handler’s voice → choice to go east → archive → nightly resurrection forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he forgoes the old vocation to become the keeper of voices, with the settlement reweighted around resonance. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the hunt and the toll of nights decoding. Orientation is crisp from the outset (scrapyard, post‑war), with no causal slips.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → sketching → anomaly → witnessing/closure. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the final reconfiguration (“echoed silence now companionable”) lands. Cost is conceptual/emotional (choosing isolation and the burden of being the anomaly) rather than decisively dramatized, but it is legible on the page. Quiet closure via witnessing the filament’s absorption reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: swap-by-swap pressure mounts, tremors answer, sky reconfigures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the board transforms, the sky rights, and Elric adopts a posture of play over victory. Cost is primarily conceptual (relinquishing the old truths, risking alteration), not materially dramatized. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds from the gallery’s rituals to the charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: refusing to bow, spelling “listen,” and the sovereign’s tremble reprice power and presence with a conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early; the pawnless board and penumbra return with intent. Cost is largely conceptual/ethical rather than materially dramatized, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: textures → feather ritual → archway → room of belonging. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis (“no longer translating the world, but belonging to it”) with on‑page consequence (stone stilled, environment reorders, gravity steadies). Orientation is crisp early, and the throughline from intent to sanctuary is coherent. The cost is subtle but legible as a relinquishment of stance and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural design teaches its pattern early (labyrinth, tapestries, hush) and coheres to closure. The mirror sequence delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: acceptance over erasure, with the persistent constraint (exile) intact. Orientation is clean from the first lines; cause/effect holds within the lyric logic. Cost is on the page: she leaves unchanged in status but altered in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early (refracting via canyon echoes) and paid off with an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing ending. Orientation is clean, and each beat compounds toward the ritual’s demand for unity versus her refusal. Closure lands on the page as she rejects the elders’ parable, with the spire’s dissolution reweighting the premise. The price is conceptual rather than materially dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual layers (cheek, brow, final tear‑gold) tighten under worsening fumes and structural failure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the altar effect reweights the premise and shows cost on the page (breath, tears, surrendered safety). Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern is taught early. No causality breaks; the persistent constraint (acid sea) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: the mirror crack precipitates the cave return, density deepens to the “I’m still here” touch, and the renunciation of the mirror/retention of ritual lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible (leaving the first finished piece, relinquishing the mirror’s authority, physical toll). Orientation is crisp and the single transition holds. The final image reweights prior material without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean, single‑scene, and cumulative: intention → activation (pressing the cork) → external confirmation (ships turn) → renewed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she commits to ongoing, quiet broadcast) with a tangible before/after. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout. Cost is present but subtle, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The closure image (full‑moon ascent, song to absences, seepage replies) lands with conceptual cost and a before/after reframing (“abandonment” → “recalibration”). Causal threads within the mode are coherent (hydraulics failure → silence → calls → final sending). Orientation is clear early and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: pressure accrues through the orchard traverse, the encounter with the traumatized trio, and culminates in renunciation. Closure lands on the page when she places the eye in the tree—an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost (relinquishing her regulator). Anchors (who/where/when) are established early and never lost. Persistent constraints (involuntary truth, unstable orchard) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of watching gaps → sensory shard on night four → conceptual reconfiguration and decision not to report. Orientation is clean from the opening; the closure lands as a charged withholding with conceptual cost. The causality is quiet but coherent—no outliney jumps or retroactive patches. Slight softness comes from limited external pressure, not structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: chip → ants → hidden door → arch → inversion → letter → departure. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (he leaves) and a resonant reconfiguration (promise reweighted by new rules of time). Magical causality is taught early and holds; the cost is present but light. No major orientation debt; the single transition is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene tightens cleanly from ascent to revelation to renunciation, landing a resonant reconfiguration closure (descend “not as queen. As witness.”). The accumulative/textural lens holds via recurring starlight/firefly motifs that reweight meaning at the end. The cost is legible on the page (forfeiture of identity/status and acceptance of grief). Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: confession → ritual → transfer of the shell culminates in a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who/where/when and stakes). The closure image (“paint the next chapter together”) reweights the scene’s logic without soft reset. No causality breaks; each move grows coherently from the prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens is taught early and held: the scroll resists, ink finally flows, the self‑hunts intensify, and closure reframes the grave and the flight. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with visible conceptual cost (“clean endings” relinquished), and the final “soar… through” pays the taught pattern. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (cabin, vocation, grave). The because/therefore chain is lyric but coherent: writing catalyzes apparitions’ fade and the cartography completes by dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the screw’s redefinition as fulcrum, its mounting, and Elara’s acceptance reweight the premise into a charged final stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a persistent constraint (anosmia) intact and conceptually priced. Orientation is clean early, and the final image (the clock on her therapy table) marks a before/after without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure teaches its pattern early (held breath; ink’s stress physics) and resolves with a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands on‑page when the final rune “breathe” breaks the suspended world, with the price acknowledged: scars persist as waypoints. Causality is tight at this scale (stress → crystallization risk → lullaby tactic → completion). Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the drive lens holds through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene causal flow holds: arrival → object placed → currents activated → memory-melody shared → annotated manuscript offered → request to write truth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible price: trust breach acknowledged, orchard loss pending, no facile reconciliation. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the accumulative texture deepens rather than stalls. The final image reweights prior beats with cost (bottle + manuscript beside the hush and imminent felling).

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and sustained: shelves by resonance, axioms, “hiccups,” and inversion sequences escalate to surrender and reconfiguration. Closure arrives on-page as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she becomes the lens/hush—with the cost of self and language legible. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~120 words), and the pattern of deepening is coherent. One could ask for a sharper mid-beat tightening, but cadence and density shifts suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the countdown, key turns, and station’s responses build toward the charged poise when “Time… held.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“clocks measured absence”—tied to on‑page action, with a subtle price in renunciation. Orientation is clean from the opening; pattern is taught early and pays off. The cost remains conceptual more than consequential, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean: approach → calibration via the button → threshold resonance → dissolution → rekeyed purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with palpable cost (letting go of the mother‑echo rather than breaching). Orientation is clear early and the drive lens holds to the final image. The because/therefore chain is lyrical rather than causal-forward but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: scrawls → reciprocal reply → father’s near‑recognition → clover token → charged return to the lantern and “Begin again.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing; the world’s rule‑set (contradictions as invitations) is reweighted with a gentler, earned poise. Orientation is clear from the outset (library, midsummer, post–heart attack). The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic but legible in what she withholds and accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via patterned vignettes and held through closure; the ending is a resonant reconfiguration as she applies the method to herself. Orientation is immediate and consistent; cause is less linear than patterned, but the cost is legible on the page. The librarian scene functions as a mid-piece intensification that tightens the pattern’s stakes. Closure lands without mechanical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene compounds sensory and thematic motifs toward a charged poise. Closure lands in the on-page resolve to continue (“She would return tomorrow…”) with the locket click and the child’s laugh reweighting the covenant. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when anchored), and set-ups (locket, ink, jetty, covenant) pay off in the final image. Cost is subtle but legible as chosen discipline/endurance over immediate grief discharge.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rumors and trades build density toward the man’s approach. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when both share loneliest memories and the rock returns merely warm—cost is the on‑page vulnerability. Orientation is crisp from the opening and remains stable. A hair of didactic framing in the last lines trims perfection but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern density builds (notes → chorus → stillpoint) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the pause of constellations frames the window. Closure lands on page with cost (placing the ring, no longer absorbing languages). No causality breaks; the scene flow is tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean accumulative structure anchored early (single POV at a gravitational anomaly) with one scene that tightens around the revision attempt. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “seeds… planted in the wrong tense” reframes the premise and her stance toward time. Because/therefore is secondary to pattern deepening, but the lens holds and the final image carries cost. Minor softness in on‑page price keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: gestures → framing click → the girl’s “Show me” → teaching under moonlight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: art as unarchived presence, with the cost of anonymity explicitly accepted (“That was the pact”). Orientation is clean and the one‑scene arc coheres. The causal thread is light, but the cadence shift when the child joins supplies a clear tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: her art‑breadcrumbing intensifies until the archive “answers,” culminating in the palm-press and choral release (a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing). Orientation is clean early; causality is lyric but legible (her actions → archive response → chamber). The cost is felt conceptually, though external resistance is minimal, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition builds to a resonant reconfiguration where the garden continues the rhythm and she redefines herself from subject to weaver. Closure is on‑page with conceptual cost—she accepts a self braided with others, foreclosing the path of solitary identity and institutional compliance. Spatial/temporal anchors are clean from the outset, and the pattern taught by anaphora pays off. The transformation is decisive without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean single‑POV progression: coin → map → keyhole → overheard confession → decisive handoff to Ruiz. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the “key” opens ears—with a quiet but coherent cost (giving up spectacle/credit and risking subtle channels). A touch of magical logic is accepted by the text and does not break causality. The arc tightens appropriately for length.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mist coalesces → she activates the shutters/mirror → the drowned woman’s response → star pierces. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: endurance affirmed, threshold work reframed by the unbroken starlight. Causality is coherent via ritual mechanics rather than plot turns, with no orientation debt. Cost is subtle but legible as ongoing duty rather than a decisive sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a clear escalation from private testing to town‑wide activation and a CR/RR closure as the town reorients toward “second thoughts.” Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when set early), and motifs return with structural purpose (midnight pulse → glowing arbors). Cost is implied (defying permits, social labels) rather than dramatized, dampening the closure’s bite. The cadence shift at midnight lands cleanly as the closing unit.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens is steady: maritime ritual → whale’s call → emergence → reentry transformed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; cost is felt in surrendering the scrimshaw and foreclosing the small‑life path. Orientation is crisp early; setup pays off cleanly. Slightly soft pressure/cost keeps it just below the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of whittling, narration, and turbine hush tightens into the decision to formalize grief for state approval, then returns to the ritual under new terms. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a clear price—sanctioned emptiness—culminating in the three‑second whisper during true silence. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and causality between visits, preparation, and compliance tracks. The circular return avoids stasis by reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is coherent: each pass through the colonnade deepens the pattern to a charged poise ending. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the closure lands via reconfiguration: the world remembers how to listen. Cost reads as conceptual (renouncing permission, becoming the threshold) rather than a concrete loss. One continuous scene with a clean cadence shift at “Unfold” and the final step onto the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: careful arrangements → resonant tone → subtle environmental response → Marta’s participation → “Tomorrow, we wake the kiln.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in agency and craft ethos. Costs are implied (abandoning perfectionist hierarchy, ceding mastery) rather than explicit. Orientation is clean from the opening line and all set‑ups pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual sequence (lens → fork → voice → release) coheres and culminates in a reweighted silence and the charged lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an on‑page image of cost/price (tears; a reframed quiet seeded with responsibility). Orientation is crisp from the outset; pattern is taught and kept. The cost remains subtle, hence shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent, and closure lands as a charged poise: the locket left, the crane placed, and the distant stir of the “curtains” reprice the pattern. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when). Cost is implied rather than dramatized—solitude and renunciation—so the final turn is quiet but legible. No causality breaks; the motif grid coheres to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → ledger confession → mapped convergences → visitor’s reframing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“They’re remembering forward”) with the tape’s reprise as charged poise. Orientation is clean from the opening; pattern-building escalates coherently. Cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through contact with the pagoda, flood of imprints, then the deliberate pattern‑breaking song. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the motes release and her stance toward grief changes, with on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and no causality breaks appear. The final decision to return to her daughter crystallizes the reweighted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → pattern recognition → conceptual reframing → precise act that reweights the dream-stream. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the closure is on-page—the stone installation triggers perceptible ripples and a reconfigured final stance. Cost is legible: a return of bite and ache to curated dreams; Elira accepts a continued vigil. The sequence keeps because/therefore logic without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: the reconstruction ritual tightens meaning until the charged poise of resignation/testimony/new sanctuary lands with cost. The tail‑as‑compass crystallizes a before/after, with explicit foreclosures of prior complicity. Timing (“three nights prior,” “Tomorrow…”) keeps the window legible. Closure is on‑page and reweights all prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: hourglass/ivy/coffee rings → tunnel → cathedral seed, culminating in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on the page with the seed dissolving into her scar and the hourglass’s spiral flow—a before/after reconfiguration. Causality remains coherent through plant telepathy and the coffee-ring clue. The price is implied (identity shift, accepting continuation) and felt, if not brutally explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build from psychometry to discovery to release, with a clear closure beat. The decision to mail the letters constitutes on‑page reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is established early (projection booth in a storm), and the pattern holds. The marquee’s unprogrammed message risks neatness but reads as charged poise rather than a mechanical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and coheres to an on‑page release: the winter fury escalates to mass tracing and liberation, then a spent aftermath. Orientation is clear (archway, aurora, instrument) and the causal pattern within the lyric mode holds. Closure lands with cost—voices released, she collapses to rest—qualifying as a decisive change. The single‑scene surge avoids outline-y “and then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: clock → seam → archive → selection → charm → return → tremble. Closure lands on‑page as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the second hand trembles, the dune brightens, and his stance eases slightly, signaling cost and continuation. Orientation is clear early and there’s no causality break; set‑ups pay off. The price is primarily conceptual/endurance, but it’s legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: forest signals → gear resonance → Edge → frequency‑keyed crossing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the gear as key to frequency and the Edge “inviting” reconfigure the premise with felt cost (abandoning the known). Orientation is clean from the outset; the pattern is taught and paid off. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pilgrimage pattern is taught early and intensifies toward the crest where artifacts reweight the quest. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the guides locate “unused courage” through modest relics, and the star‑holes seeded in town enact a conceptual cost/transfer. Orientation is clear from the outset (town, ridgeway, twilight) and the final image pays off established methods. The cost is contemplative—time, vigilance, and renunciation of pursuit—subtle but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual mornings, the staircase “oracle,” and the child’s appearance accrue pressure toward a quiet but decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the vow is breached and the structure is implicitly risked—as the stain flushes gold and dust shakes loose. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and the pattern it teaches pays off. Setups (bolt, stain, silence doctrine) are kept and repaid.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: seeding the library → witnesses converge → font revelation → public unmasking → refusal. Closure lands on-page with social cost and a clear before/after. The midsection compresses escalation (“Days bled into weeks”) and keeps most friction offstage, but it doesn’t break logic. The drive lens reads Causal with a quiet Accumulative cadence and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative drive: taps → lag → subroutine → dive → coral revelation → practice transformed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world and her work are re‑priced (listening as method and ethic) with a felt cost in solitude, time, and relinquishing the search posture. Setups (atlas, tapping, AI) pay off causally without hand‑waving. The chain maintains because/therefore linkage while preserving lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive builds cleanly from stargazing to stone‑hum to communal awakening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: rebellion reframed as listening, enacted by the aria and the bay lighting up as others arrive. Orientation is clear early (abandoned repair bay at twilight). The on‑page cost is subtle but legible as a renunciation of old modes rather than a decisive sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure builds cleanly from decoding to ritual to diffusion, with a coherent closure (conceptual repricing/resonant reconfiguration). Orientation is swift and legible; the lens holds through the quiet recalibration. Cost is mostly conceptual—she relinquishes singular control and risks defiance of the Council—yet present on the page. No teleports or outliney “and‑then” sequencing; cause flows via intent and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural arc holds cleanly: entering the arboretum → freeze → reweighting of the photograph → new practice (sketching, gifting) → charged final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost on the page (unmetered crying, risk of openness). Orientation is crisp early, and motif linkages (photo/pearl/stillness) pay off causally in the internal logic. Persistent constraint (trauma imprint) shapes the tactics and final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural build is clean: stitching → pattern resonance → library’s responsive turn → cocooning compression → reassembled box. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (compression, bone‑break metaphor) and a charged final object. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/why), and the motif chain pays off on the page. Minor ding: stakes remain largely interior, but the piece honors its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → pattern recognition → self‑experiment → disappearance, with coherent because/therefore links. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and closure lands on the page with cost. The brief coda through Ghostwing’s “understanding” shifts vantage but keeps the lens. No major setup is dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative lens: preparation → activation → citywide resonance → capture → aftermath. Closure lands through a charged reconfiguration—truth seeded into the populace at the cost of the archivist’s erasure. Causality is clean (device → broadcast → social ripple); the later montage expands consequences without diffusing the core line. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: a pattern of renunciation and care culminates in the child’s question and the charged gifting of a cutting. Orientation is clear early (glass dome, Scorched Belt, fallen tower), and motifs return with purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—continuity enacted—carrying conceptual cost against a brutal world. Stakes remain quiet, but the final act’s cost is legible in scarcity and refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: careful hunting → tonal key found → spike charged → inversion → release. Closure lands on the page with cost: the spike cracks, and she relinquishes capture in favor of carry/transfer (RR/CR). Setups (fragile chords, voicing silence, grieving constellations) pay off cleanly in the final image. Orientation is strong from the outset; no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑scene causal chain is clear: call → pattern recognition → telescope confirmation → compiled proof → dissemination. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she commits evidence to circulation, foreclosing silence. Cost is largely conceptual and implied (risk and blowback), not materially felt on the page. Orientation is strong from the outset; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑POV causal chain holds: letters → knowledge of Model L‑7’s curse → amber activation → song + blood‑ink tether → machine’s weeping and release. Closure lands on the page with cost (blood, self‑addressed letter, acceptance of culpability) and a reconfigured world image (time “stitching,” Cradle Major). Orientation is clean from the opening. A few magical leaps (firefly→glyph) are accepted by the taught rules but keep it just below 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (emergent hush, listening) and held through a single scene that escalates from tracing to resonance to unification. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes potential, charged by the tile’s on‑page fracture. Causality is clean within the lyric frame—her interjection changes the pattern and thus the sound‑presence. Minor neatness in the final walk‑home shard keeps it just shy of truly exceptional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: detail and ritual build toward a communal redefinition, paid off by the magistrate exchange and the survivors’ participation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—mercy redefined as practice with cost—on the page. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/after the fire) and the pattern is taught and sustained. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than plot‑threat physical, but it’s legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: coin as compass → thread selection → seven-note intervention → coin sacrificed to grow a sapling. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she foregoes haunting for rooted legacy, with visible cost in dissolution and relinquishing the coin. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and causal links are legible within the lyric frame. The brief postlude of outcomes pays off the echoes without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensations → mapping → rig assembly → frequency lock → conceptual flip (“true communion wasn’t chemical”). Orientation is clean early (studio, recall, geode) and the pattern teaches itself. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a charged final image and future-facing stance. Cost is present conceptually (abandoning pharmaceutical certainty for fragile, embodied risk) but not sharply tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: warming leaf → float → thermographic “question” → biothermal “song” → dissolution forms a coherent intensification. Closure lands on the page with cost (loss of the leaf) and a reconfigured purpose. Orientation is crisp from the start; no teleports or rule breaks. The final image reprices the premise (from mapping to relaying) without explanatory overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural build is taught early and coheres: hourglass → buttons → echo’s clarity → dissemination. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: “future is folded,” followed by a stance shift (sharing jars) and a charged final image. Cost is felt more as renunciation of fixed prophecy than personal sacrifice, but it’s legible. No orientation debt; pattern remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each concrete step (climb, hatch, pillbox, microfilm, burial) coheres toward a charged renunciation. Orientation is clean early, and the relay station/hatch set-ups pay off. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: leaving the truth to thaw with a visible cost (no retrieval, erasure of self). Persistent constraints (injury, weather, season) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: weather, fog, and the “gutter clock” build to a Charged Poise when the ticking stops, fog parts, and he offers the needle. Orientation is clear early; a single scene tightens cleanly. Cost reads as endurance and a principled refusal of control until the moment ripens. Quiet but decisive reconfiguration at the threshold image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thrum intensifies, visions layer, and the final act reconfigures meaning (soft vessel, unfired, glass nested). Orientation is clean from the outset (potter, kiln, beekeeping oasis, wasteland). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with the cost of relinquishing the guiding object. Causality is lyric but coherent, with because/therefore links through sun‑alignment and kindness‑activation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (garden → prisms → communal response) and held through closure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the neighborhood shifts from hush-as-suspense to hush-as-reverence as dawn arrives, with the prisms working unattended. Cost is legible in endurance (aches, soot in lungs legacy) and in choosing a modest, temporary remedy over grand fixes. Orientation is clear from the start; set‑ups (tooth, prism, moonlight) all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: pattern of calibration → crisis (cloud-tide, hum falter) → intervention → conceptual repricing toward genesis. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration as the sundial’s shadow shifts to “genesis,” reweighting the premise. Causality is clean within the lyric mode; the physical act (channeling) bridges into the conceptual turn. The cost is gently implied (risk of losing the coordinates, personal exertion) rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the twig spiral arrives, ritual intensifies (names to birds), the object responds (glows), command (“Rejoin”), and the on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as Aris dissolves and reconfigures into the temple’s pulse; the price is identity. Causality is clean and taught by action rather than exposition. No orientation debt; the pattern learned early pays off at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: detect → analyze → counter-broadcast → social response → withdrawal → renewed stance. The piece adheres to a single-scene window with one tightening as the tricksters “pulse with irritation.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive defeat, with a credible next-steps image (pinning the new chart). Cost is present but modest, more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑scene progression is clear: nexus → narrowing passage → chamber → embodiment, with accumulative pressure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the key as truth embodied) and is on‑page. However, the price of this change is soft—no visible loss beyond dropping the compass—dulling the decisiveness of the arc. Orientation is strong and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ribbon → vigil of textured portraits → man drawn in → masks unearthed → town’s reconfigured empathy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“The cold cases wouldn’t close in court”). One coincidence (the man appearing) is acceptable under the lens, paid off by pattern density and the ribbon’s charged placement. The dawn unearthing is slightly summarized but still integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is swift and clean, and causality holds: decode stanza → activate resonance board → question the storm → layer coordinates → jet stream shifts. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a conceptual repricing (“the storm is memory”). The primary weakness is the soft cost; resolution arrives without a concrete setback or trade-off beyond risk. Still, the arc coheres within a single-scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: tune → glass‑image shift → silhouette → renunciatory closure. Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The decision not to pursue and to step into “disbelief” creates a legible before/after. Causal links are lyric rather than mechanical but coherent across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and tactics (money, markers, train) accrue toward a conceptual repricing of failure. Closure lands cleanly as he transforms the train into a roaming think‑tank and accepts the loop as dance, with the cost of abandoning the startup legible. Orientation is clear from the outset; set‑ups pay off in the final image. Stakes are internal but coherently pressured by collapse and pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative drive holds: variable stars → telegram → dream rescue → reframed mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when she shifts from translator to burden-redistributor, with cost implied in accepting ongoing weight. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the two-shard structure (observatory/dream/return) is legible. Pressure is gentle and largely unopposed, which keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration: the seed’s circles culminate in heart‑level release and a reweighted world (“lake drained into sky”). Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when), and the closure cost is on the page (surrender of armor, cracked ribs as release). Persistent constraints (seed/lake/orchard) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: omen-rich approach → key action at the dais → cobalt eruption and merger. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and set‑ups (clipping, scars, node glade) pay off in the ritual. Closure lands as a charged poise/RR: the covenant stirs and she merges, reweighting the world’s rules. The cost is felt conceptually (surrender/anchoring, risk of awakening a suppressed pact) more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with a clear drive lens (accumulative/situational) and a legible closure beat (Charged Poise/RR) as Kael’s grip loosens and the roots begin to weave them together. Causality holds: Elira’s inlaying practice prompts the orchard’s collaboration. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, keeping it shy of a decisive turn. Orientation is strong from the opening line; no structural debt.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative drive is clear: object patterns and sensory echoes build to a resonant reconfiguration when he starts “Project Echo” and pins the motto. Orientation is clean from line one; setup (quarry, job, cloth, Milwaukee failure) coheres into closure with cost (risking renewed engagement with music). The final image crystallizes a before/after without false neatness. The causal chain is soft but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: ritual speech → symbol‑drawing → resonance → seed split → renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“She didn’t translate it. She bowed. And left.”), foreclosing the path of completion for a charged poise. Orientation is clear early and the causal thread (analogy → resonance → germination) is coherent. The final unknown sign reweights the premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual intensifies at the creel’s immersion and the acceptance of contradictions, culminating in a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when via atrium, task, moons), no debt. The final reconfiguration—shelving the creel under “Waning Wonder,” edges softened by a moonless phase—lands with conceptual cost. Slightly modest pressure keeps it below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: confessions intensify, glow deepens, cave vibrates, culminating in the crowning and inward burst. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she becomes the conduit, pearl gone, stakes reweighted with a felt cost. No broken causality; set‑ups (shell, activation method) pay off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: graffiti discoveries and measured rituals intensify toward Track 3 as threshold. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she inks a route “through the heart of her own neglect,” then plays louder and leaves without mark, the station subtly “rearranged.” Cost is on-page (raw grief and endurance; refusal of external absolution) and the persistent constraint (patched instrument, abandoned place) shapes the ending image. Orientation is clear from the opening; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (reversing stacks, propagation delays) and held to closure. The final turn—inscribing the silence and becoming the archive—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable cost. Setups (watch thresholds, self‑documentation, recursion) pay off cleanly in the mirror scene. Orientation is purposeful and supports the conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is clean: omen → divination → attunement to plants → resonant act → arrival/melting → reconfigured order. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the empire’s symbolic keystone dissolves into seeds that colonize imperial authority. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. The only soft spot is the ease of execution once the tactic is chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: preparation → infusion → pulse → release, culminating in a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what), and the emerald chip’s activation provides an on‑page cost/repricing: not saving life but preserving the liminal instant. The final image (chip set adrift) reweights the premise with conceptual cost and a foreclosed alternative (burial/mourning). No causal gaps or false turns; the sequence coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the climb → grotto hush → memory/breath work → breeze insight → hairpin placement culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost (“weight of release”) and a new stasis (belonging; returning to the grove). Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality breaks. Quiet, single‑scene structure suits the aim and pays off in the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure holds cleanly to closure: campfire → chimes instruct → resisted clasp → unhook → reoriented professional stance. The ending delivers a Decisive Change with cost on the page. Orientation and lens are clear early and maintained. The causal thread (mother’s code enabling present action) is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: stone toss → ripple reading → conceptual reveal → charged plan for tomorrow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a clear before/after in understanding. Cost is implied (risk of vanishing; Elira’s withholding), not fully felt on-page, keeping it shy of exceptional. Orientation is crisp early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds cleanly: observation → decoding → acceptance of the pulse → renunciatory stasis. Orientation is clear early (towers of bone in a canyon) and closure lands on the page with cost. The closing image reconfigures options (becoming landmark, not path-chaser) without causal breaks. Tight, single‑scene coherence with one meaningful tightening via the murmuration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: contact with the keystone opens the path; the walk leads to the figure and tree; the offering produces a reweighted ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he foregoes stature and keeps sharing small charms despite continued rejection. Cost is on-page (he leaves the keystone; institutions still exclude him). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is tight: key tag incites, dive intensifies, ledger revelation reframes, and the surfacing/bench handoff lands closure. The accumulative lens holds, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where his role changes with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and no causal seams show. The on‑page price is more conceptual than physical, but it’s felt in the renunciation and charged handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of chance‑driven listening → unbidden vision → chosen act; closure = Resonant Reconfiguration with a legible before/after. Orientation is clear from the ambered deck and coin routine; no causality breaks. Cost is conceptual but present (giving up her crutch to lead). Tight, one‑scene arc with a single meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: present‑tense ritual deepens until closure, where the atlas pulses and his stance reconfigures from heartbroken to heart‑carrier. Orientation is clean from the first lines and each beat compounds toward the prism‑lit act. Cost is legible in tears and the acceptance of stewardship. Quiet but definite RR; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single‑scene accumulative design coheres: the months of study → resin pour guided by dripping rates → refusal to ring → letting the bell go. Closure lands on the page with cost (releasing the restored bell), and the causal chain is legible without hand‑waving. Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and stable. The final image (fish breaching) reconfigures stakes from abstract balance to concrete response.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drought → resurfacing → photo‑trail → public mosaic → officials. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: he rejects expungement in favor of open archiving, changing his role with social cost implied. Orientation is clean within the opening lines; causality is coherent. The main weakness is consequence lightness—no sharp penalty for defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and holds; the scene climbs from preparation to starlings‑guided attunement to a reweighted self. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal is gone, the warmth lingers, and she exits “flameless but alight,” with journals echoing the dual lens. Cost is on‑page (absorption of the object, relinquishment of command) with a clear before/after in stance. Minor absence of external pressure keeps it in the quiet‑closure band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: silence arrives, communal fear rises, she selects a minimal, bodily‑coded chime, and we land in Charged Poise as she moves toward the next arbor. Closure costs are conceptual and social—the price of curating truth to sustain trust—made legible by the re‑clipped buckle as vow. Orientation is clean from the start; setup pays off precisely at the chime and reprise. No causality gaps; the stakes tighten once in a purposeful cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clean: accusations → harmonizing opposites → resonance → awakening → renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: custody becomes irrelevant as autonomy asserts itself, with a felt price in Kael’s relinquishment. Orientation is strong early; the lens holds through the end. Cost is more conceptual than tactile, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed → vow → rooms escalating in strangeness → spiral shoot → lifelong vigil → final line. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: “never meant to flower” reweights all prior beats with a cost (decades of waiting without bloom). Orientation is crisp from line one; set‑ups pay off (mystery seed, willow, silence as fortress). Slightly summary‑tilted midsection keeps it shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly: the tunnel visits accrue toward a charged poise where the laugh flickers and he recommits. Orientation is swift and legible (who/where/why) without expositional drag. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—he chooses continuation under the same constraint, reweighted by the “tiny, tinny, triumphant” laugh. No causal missteps; the single-scene frame remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive coheres: the pendant’s call → waiting with ache → warming sigils → placement in the statue’s hand → garden “breathing” → emissary stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing the pendant; choosing uncertainty). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern is taught and paid off. One tightening beat (the pendant warms as mist thickens) credibly precipitates the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative build from preparation to vivification lands a clean Conceptual Repricing (“It was deconstruction”) with a charged final image (portable twilight, burden/benediction). Orientation is immediate (ember nexus, obsidian floor, twilight), and causal beats cohere through ritual adjustments. Cost is legible on the page: he forecloses the path of perfection/arrival in favor of endless approach. The through‑line holds under an accumulative/textural lens without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens is clean: the moon’s perigee, the placed fragment, the hush‑pulse, and the city awakening stair-step toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure is on the page: towers reconfigured as instruments and the protagonist as conductor, with a charged final broadcast image. Causality is lyric but coherent; no teleporting props or rule breaks. The cost is mostly conceptual (a reoriented pursuit and self‑effacement), which slightly tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: vanishings → discovery of radio → pattern‑mapping → harmonic beacon → convergence. The accumulative lens holds; the braiding of signals, tides, and glyphs tightens toward an on‑page convergence that reconfigures the world. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (ongoing vigilance, acceptance of transience). Causality is intact with planted payoffs (hourglass, radio, grotto) activated at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned weaving → gallery resistance → eruption → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration when she releases the thread and the space restitches into a new state. Cost is legible but subtle—she accepts a reweighted self and forecloses the safety of detachment; the mirrored warnings and the “older, quieter” image mark the before/after. Causality is clean within the chosen logic; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: class → blackout awe → pedagogical reframing with the anchor → earned, resonant closing image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (adapting to “unfolded horizons”), with the cost of the lost sky and reliance on a new grammar made legible. Causality is soft but consistent under the chosen lens, with no orientation debt. The absence of a sharper in-scene test limits peak intensity, but the cadence shift is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to a resonant reconfiguration: the synchronized pulses and thinned mist close the waiting with conceptual cost. Causality holds—photo’s rhythm → tracking → discovery → counter‑pulse → handclasp → exit. The closure lands on the page with a felt before/after (panic/waiting to calm/movement). Cost is gentle rather than wrenching, but legible in the refusal of fantasy and acceptance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene tightens toward tidal nadir, activation, and a resonant closing ascent. Closure lands as a charged poise/resonant reconfiguration: presence is “returned,” fleck is spent, and the witness role reweighted. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds; costs (time window, loss of the fleck, near-flood) are legible on the page. A hair more on-page jeopardy during the return tide would push it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean: radio static clears → ritual unfolds → ghosts settle, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who/where/when), and the observatory’s logic holds. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (he remains “buried” socially, choosing arrangement over erasure). A hairline shortfall is the light pressure on options—no decisive narrowing beyond the ritual’s inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: birds arrive → diamond activated → canyon reconfigures sound → forward‑echo closure. Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules pivot when the canyon replies and carries her final word outward. Persistent constraints (the diamond’s hunger; canyon’s echo‑memory) shape tactics. Cost is legible in her weeping endurance and in the necessity to feed noise to save meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: arrowhead → gravity hiccup → SEND → metamorphosis → tattoo/phone loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (identity shift, surrender of bitterness, unknown obligations to the Dancer). Orientation is crisp from the opening sentence; the hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds. The price is felt but gentle, keeping this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: music accretes, shifts cadence, and reconfigures the system (statues to gardeners) with cost on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the shell’s dust and the apple’s handoff. The arc stays coherent with one deepening turn rather than reversals. Minor softness in jeopardy keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: heavier object → increased surveillance → tactical reroute → camouflage via storm-mimic grid → launch. Orientation is strong early; the lens holds through a quiet, earned closing image (child and thunder). Closure reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: options reweighted by a risky act with felt cost. The risk remains untested on-page, softening impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → awakening → completion, with a clean RR/Earned Stasis at the end. Orientation is swift and sustained (carpenter, mist, train), and payoffs honor early seeds (halo, wind bells). On‑page cost is mostly stamina/time rather than a narrowing dilemma, but the closure lands. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑POV, one scene plus a single crossing beat; orientation is swift and clean. The accumulative drive coheres to a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: stories as living orbs, her role shifting from retrieval to reawakening. Causality is clear (scroll → scarf → axiom → amphitheater → song → return), but the closure’s cost is conceptual rather than felt, keeping it below the highest band. No dropped setups or logic leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural design tightens toward the dawn-mixing act, yielding a clean on-page reconfiguration when the dream manifests. Orientation is strong from the opening; setup beats (method, components, stakes) pay off causally in the final brushstroke. Cost is largely conceptual/emotional (years of pursuit, the surrender hue) rather than a fresh on-page sacrifice, softening impact slightly. Nonetheless, closure lands with a felt before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: star → silver thread → door → mirrors → vow → release. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration—he frees the idea and carries it outward; the door’s “sigh of gratitude” seals the before/after. Cost is present but conceptual (renouncing inherited fear) rather than materially pressed. Orientation and pattern are taught early and pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear single‑POV structure with a coherent Hybrid (accumulative/causal) drive: mapping distortions → experiment under the warped skylight → triggered pulse → charged choice. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis; cost is legible in the line “let the orchard take the rest,” reweighting all prior beats. Orientation is strong early, with the greenhouse and ring of wrecks anchoring. A hairline limitation: the choice’s consequence remains implied rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens taught early and held: the shadow, tea geometry, and backward-walk pattern tighten toward a charged poise. Closure lands on the page—the shadow remains contained, exile stays reversible, cartographer’s map reconfigures—at a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. Stakes and rules remain consistent without causal cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single scene, accumulative lens holds: the present ritual tightens toward the seed’s cracking and the seam knitting shut. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the seed is “succored,” the seam closes, and options shift from peril to belonging. Cost is more conceptual than dramatized; still, the on‑page ritual and the quiet final image carry it. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens elegantly, with the volatile confession-knot as the decisive intensification. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the sanctuary’s light changes; the net becomes “just hemp and history,” and she refuses backward glance. Causality is clean (knot-by-knot release → sanctuary unknots → world quietens), and the cost is legible in the violent burst and her slowed, ritual reverence thereafter. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with one strong cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: evidence layers (1953→2019 footage, spiral map tear), culminating in the dusk silhouette and token offering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (refusing reconstruction, embracing witnessing). Orientation is clean from the outset; the pattern taught early is paid off precisely at the last‑light beat. Stakes stay coherent and narrow in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative arc holds: discovery → observation → patterning → conceptual reframing → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the narrator chooses to let the globe unmake, foreclosing the analytic path. Orientation is clear early and carries cleanly to the cliff. Setups (Earhart/library) pay off through the receiver insight and final act.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: encoding → reply → song → communion → outreach. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her stance shifts from guarded sanctuary to public invitation, with an on‑page price in vulnerability. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/why) and the pattern pays off without causal breaks. The final image (glowing sigils lingering) seals the after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: floors as cadence; light reveals cipher; vellum → diary; acceptance at the peak. Orientation is clean from the outset (elevator, spire, mission), and set-ups pay off (goggles, scattered light). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she descends with a reweighted aim, not coordinates. Cost is primarily emotional and subdued but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: one continuous scene where observation and inscription tighten toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (gondola, telescope, profession), and backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the cloud, the ledger). Closure lands in the act of memorializing the dissolving cloud, reweighting the premise with a felt price. The structure is quiet but coherent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, continuous scene with clear anchors (who/where/when) and a clean accumulative drive to closure. The demolition clock and the coin’s deciphering yield a steady because/therefore linkage: retrieve relic, translate touch into sky, finish before dawn. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she accepts no witnesses and the imminent loss. Slightly low on external turns, but cohesion and cost are undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean: discovery → demonstration → communal enactment → reweighted ending image. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, with a Conceptual Repricing at the end (“language” found). Closure lands, but the cost is mostly conceptual; risks or sacrifices aren’t stressed on the page. Causality is steady and orientation impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: approach → keys → interrogation by memory → constellation → renunciation. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: she abandons the chase to become “keeper of quiet mendings,” paying with the apron’s dissolution and the gears’ sequestration. Orientation is clean within ~120 words and the causal sequence, while lyrical, is legible. Cost is visible in the final beats and persists beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality tracks cleanly: chalk prompts → gathering at the third moon → bell rung → butterflies → nebula revealed → departure. Orientation is crisp early, and the pattern of set‑up/payoff holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (leaving the orchard for the unknown). While quiet, the causal line remains intact and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early (pane of hush, inward beacon) and intensifies through nested patterns to the on‑page RR/CR at the puppet eye’s chime. Stakes are tested and paid: the universe’s end arrives with reweighted meaning, not evaded. Orientation is clean from the first line; the lighthouse and chronometer ground the ritual. The cost is unmistakable in the tender extinguishing of stars and civilizations.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is immediate and clean; the causal thread (lost girl + frost clock → guidance tactics → handoff → return) holds. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he saves one and recommits to the burden as frost feathers the branches. The cost is present but quiet; the rescue resolves largely without frictive setback, which trims peak intensity. Still, the final image reweights the premise with restraint and price.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear from the outset, with the river/foam patterning deepening toward a resonant repricing at the end. Closure lands as a charged poise: acceptance reframed and a concrete future choice (Chrysalis Mesh) with emotional cost made present. Orientation is immediate and stable. No causality breaks or soft resets undermine the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (each sale as measured absence; burden redistributed). Orientation is crisp in the opening sentence and remains stable. The ledger quantifications pay off the stated method on the page. The final image (open ledger, seven incisions) crystallizes the before/after without tying a bow.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain reveals geometry, descent intensifies exposure, the basin plunge culminates in an on‑page reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the single continuous scene coheres. Closure lands with cost—the pavilion releases remorse as she emerges “hollowed but whole.” The because/therefore chain in this mode is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: ritual + architecture + object culminate in the elevator’s opening and community reorientation. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the silo becomes stage/sanctuary; the cuckoo weight is a lasting price/anchor. Causality remains coherent with tower mechanics channeling song to the valley. Minor softness in on‑page cost keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural design holds: the mirrored object prompts memory‑merging, which culminates in a reweighted final stance (RR/CR) as she pockets the mirror and commits to return. Orientation is clear early (canyon, moon, engineer) and the pattern teaches itself. Closure has conceptual cost—living with rewired grief—though the price remains more tonal than dramatized. The beats link cleanly without outliney “and‑then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: thresholds and inverted gravity create a patterned deepening toward the chamber. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (acquiring the Seed) plus a Conceptual Repricing (vigilance belongs in margins), and the chamber sealing and gravity snap provide concrete finality. Causality is clean—fragment fuse → sigil → door—within the lyric mode. The visible cost is modest but legible in the sealed chamber and collapsing window.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → study → construction → activation. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: silence repriced as potential, fracture as frequency, the grove participating in song. Causality is tight without over‑explaining; the insulator’s geometry dictates tactics and the final image. Felt cost is conceptual (months of absence, surrender to listening) rather than peril, but it registers at ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: eclipse approaches, field intensifies, he correlates silence, then reconfigures purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “not an end, but a reset,” and he chooses to teach correlation. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene coheres. The cost is subtle but legible in the renunciation of looking back and the recast of exile.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clean: attempts, adjustments, fracture, click, and aftermath. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis image (she stands against fireworks, having preserved silences) with conceptual cost. The causal thread is steady if gentle; pressure is time-bound by fireworks. Stakes resolve on the page without mechanical tying-off.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative structure tightens from dormancy to omen to bloom to village repricing, with closure landing as a felt CR/Earned Stasis hybrid. The “tide’s thought” turning coheres with the collective shift and sets the clock for the bloom and Elira’s choice to inhale. Cost is legible in the stench endured and in relinquishing control to surrender. Minor reliance on mythic coincidence (collective doubt crest) is thematically apt and does not undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is clean: inversion enables search → discovery → test touch → urgency → insertion → world‑song. The piece runs an accumulative/textural lens with a clear closure unit (resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing) on the page. The live clock (“minutes”) tightens the final push, and set‑ups (bio‑harmonic echoes, dew‑spirals) pay off in the ending image. Cost is felt conceptually (a new duty to listen) more than materially but reads.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clear, with orientation locked early and a coherent build toward a charged-poise ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he commits to triangulation and steps into the wind’s “learning,” reframing the threat. Cost is conceptual and anticipatory rather than paid on-page, but it’s legible. Setups (crane reposition, wind spikes) pay off in the closing resolve to map the next convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chime intensifies pattern toward a reconfiguration where the sheet’s role transfers into her body and the cavern. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing (“wonder…not as luxury, but as oxygen”) backed by enacted ritual and revealed changes. Causality is lyrical but consistent (strike → color/sound → thawed laughter → cavern revealed). Cost is lighter than maximal but legible in the surrender of the tool and chosen exposure to the outer world.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive holds: careful setup → seam crossing → autopsy of collapsed realms → renunciatory return. Closure lands on the page with cost: she forecloses restoration, redefines her role, and leaves the tool to decay, charging the final image. Orientation is clean from the opening; the between‑place shard is legible and paid off by the codex and monument. Causality is tight without over‑explaining; no stray set‑ups remain unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the halo’s draining, the vanishing stars, and the pamphlet cycle build to a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise ending. Closure carries cost—the halo’s final dimming and her walk into dark with the unsolved mathematics. Orientation is clear early (operator, workshop, night sky); pattern is taught and paid off. Slight distance from causal beats (key consequences happen off‑page) keeps this just shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: auroral cues → fork choice → market hush → renunciation. Closure lands on‑page with cost as she lets the pendant go—foreclosing her secret method. Orientation is clean early; causal threads (pendant resonance guiding choices) remain coherent. The ending’s CR/RR reweights the pact from private routine to public myth without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly from alignment of prism to the charged final images. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: proof redefined as resonance, choice to keep silent with conceptual cost. Orientation is crisp early (quartz arbor, car, frost) and all set‑ups (prism, frost, arbor) pay off. The causal chain is subtle but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: the rummage box → puzzle → rebuilt loom → solstice → self‑weaving ladder tightens toward a costly closure. Closure lands on the page with felt price (chair empty, last thread falls) and a charged payoff (amber bead reaches him). The coincidence of the rummage box is fable‑legible and paid off by consistent world‑rules. Orientation is clear from the opening and time/place shifts are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: daily descents, dwindling silk, and a final application to the oldest glyph culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: he exhausts the last silk and accepts forging without it. Orientation is clean from the opening image; setup pays off at the glyph and arches humming. The because/therefore is lyric more than causal, but linkages are consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑POV with one clean transition; the drive lens reads Hybrid with accumulative texture and causal turns. Orientation is excellent and the shard’s resonance links beats to a coherent closure. The revelation (data core) lands on the page with cost and reconfigures prior material. Slight convenience (friction‑free entry to “Archival Containment” and passive automatons) softens the chain of difficulties but not the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean, with a clear tightening when the lamp extinguishes and a subtle release at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he recommits to tending, reweighted by the lamp’s return and his internal warmth. Causality remains coherent under the lyric lens; ambiguity about the “ghost‑light” supports rather than breaks logic. Stakes and price are contained yet legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural design is taught early and sustained; the lantern-ritual deepens to a charged poise ending. Orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern coheres to closure. Cost is present (fatigue, eternal charge, love disguised as storm) but stays conceptual rather than dramatized in a decisive turn. The closure image—mirror/map/moment—cleanly reconfigures the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: repeated observation → angle insight → structural color insight → stance shift → charged final image. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/what) and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence. Causality is soft but coherent, motivated by pattern rather than event. The cost at the end is subtle, more epiphany than loss, which tempers peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens holds: patient handling → lunar healing → projection of dreams → decision to follow → forest offering → cartographer stance. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a before/after (technician to pilgrim-cartographer). Causality is clean and props are kept; the cost is conceptual/emotional rather than materially pressured. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural build is coherent: hum → communal joining → mica releasing light → communal dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the final mirror image repricing the world’s logic. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (relinquishing hoarded light/silence), not materially dramatized, which softens impact slightly. Orientation is clear and the pattern taught early pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the invitation’s rediscovery concentrates pressure to a clean RR/Earned Stasis at midnight. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the scene advances through linked images toward a decisive reconfiguration. Cost is legible: she pins the invitation and positions herself to face the Society at dawn. The structure is tight for the length, though the external consequence is deferred rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a sequence of gentle acts compounds toward a resonant reconfiguration at the hidden spring’s drip. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; one continuous scene tightens coherently. Closure lands as Charged Poise/CR (remembering how to ask; water stirs) with a modest but legible cost. A touch more on‑page consequence or foreclosed alternative would raise the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: tension accrues as the slide dims and vows emerge toward the “forgiveness” recalibration. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the slide’s power is consumed but translated, reweighting the premise with a felt cost. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/what), and causality is coherent. Tight single scene with one meaningful deepening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene with crisp anchors and a coherent drive lens (accumulative/situational) culminating in on‑page closure: the deal breaks. Causal throughline holds—her controlled approach and the fob brush precipitate the decisive shift. Cost is felt conceptually (risk and lineage exposure) though lightly rendered. The recognition turn is clean and earned by prior set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: the copper→ozone→honey sequence tightens until the vote/absorption lands with cost. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—weather as communal archive, doubt into trust, ring retired. Orientation is crystal early and prop/state continuity is tight. The forest’s decision is situational pressure; her participation and relinquishment keep causality honest.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive coheres: descent → mental sketching → animated faces → lock resonance → tool recovery → release. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (releasing her father, relinquishing the tombstone hoard). Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The ending image (“sovereign”) is earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: map → atrium echo → chest of letters → voiced witness → identity shift. Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing: the goal reframes from finding to becoming the archive, with cost demonstrated by prior wilting and solitary labor. Orientation is clean from the outset, and causal links remain coherent. The cost is evident in the endurance through ambient lies and the burden of carrying others’ truths.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual mornings → storm harmonics → child encounter → renunciatory absence → charged continuation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: her departure reweights the vigil with weather as conductor and a felt conceptual price. The causal line is gentle (no hard turn), but the before/after is legible and paid in the final image. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive coheres: storm/magnetic shift intensify pressure, leading to the ignition and reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the static harmonizes, box emptied, farm stabilized—with cost in irrevocable change. Orientation is strong from the outset (android in a glass dome during a magnetic shift). Minor softness in on‑page price keeps this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual visits and hearing culminate in the mailbox opening and Leo’s softened grief (a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost in patience and vulnerability). Orientation is clean from the outset and the locket-mailbox loop pays off on-page. The final image reweights the rules of the courtyard. Minor neatness in the ritual’s success keeps it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: motifs (dance, dice, journals) ratchet toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—she rewrites herself to encrypt liberation. Causality is legible through ritualized actions (vents, archives unlock, submersibles awaken) and a coherent final act that forecloses a path. Cost is on the page: she doesn’t board and triggers a harmonized collapse/veil. Orientation is clear from the outset; pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive tightens cleanly: whale → anomalies → calibrated ritual → doorway → crossing → reunion. Orientation is swift and coherent, and all set‑ups (journal, wildflowers, coffee‑mapping) pay off causally. Closure lands on the page (Charged Poise shading into Decisive Change) with conceptual cost implied (leaving her world) if not fully taxed. No key logic gaps or soft resets undercut the end.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual builds to a reconfiguration where doom becomes a plea and the wing ascends. Orientation is clean from the opening image; pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—she commits to returning, reweighting the premise. The cost is quiet and conceptual, not visceral, which slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive: teas → seal presented → key reveal → decision to descend creates a clean tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR—the world is redefined (sentient building; tool to write back) and the relationship discards its scaffolding of lies. On‑page cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening impact. Orientation is excellent from the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene under an accumulative/textural lens tightens toward a clean on‑page closure. The live clock (stars fading) and the shell’s warming/clarifying whispers escalate to the vow and relinquishment. Cost is legible: she forgoes healing for sovereignty and leaves the charged object behind. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no causality or lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: comet‑key opens vault → rewriting under resistance → final stroke triggers unraveling; closure lands on the page with cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric coloration and holds through the ending. Stakes are tested on‑scene by the scroll’s resistance and the time pressure of the dripping stalactites. No orientation debt; the Decisive Change (curse unravels) is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative drive lands a resonant reconfiguration: her song returns stolen resonance and reorients the entity from feeding to listening. Orientation is legible early (canyon, nexus, starlight) and the shell’s layered revelations tighten logic toward the lullaby choice. Cost is visible on the page (voice surrendered, throat raw) and the final image reweights the premise. Escalation is more textural than causal; a single on‑page resistance beat would strengthen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the dream cameos accrete until the decisive placement of the globe reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on the page with cost (“The child’s cameo appearances will fade now...”), and the “sigh” of release gives a resonant cadence. Orientation is clean from line one; no lens ambiguity. The mosaic ripples after the act reinforce the before/after without flattening the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a night of listening stacks toward a charged poise closure. The ending functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she chooses endurance and witness with an implied cost of invisibility. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and motifs recur causally toward the final image. Slightly modest cost on the page keeps it below the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens holds: orchard observation → letters’ reveal → diamond test → plaque discovery → renewed mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the “curse” recast and the network revealed. Cost is conceptual (risk, sorrow, burden) more than embodied; still sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean early and never wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: storm as veil → contact (“Send the cipher”) → harmonic broadcast piggybacking on Kael’s towers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (invitation broadcast), but the cost is mostly conceptual and under-explicit. Orientation is clean from the outset; pattern is taught and kept. One meaningful tightening occurs when the outside voice confirms she’s found.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the music box discovery/repair tightens the pattern, leading to communal exchanges and the charged child scene, then the final poem and disappearance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt conceptual cost (he’s gone; the jars and music box continue translating). Orientation is immediate and clean. Causality within the magical premise remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: ice sings → key activates → descent → sonic assault → counter‑resonance → absolution. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after and a modest cost (exhaustion, reconfigured world stance). No orientation debt; the drive lens reads Causal with lyric texture. Slight convenience in the total neutralization of threats keeps it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of moon‑tracking, coordinates, and the viaduct’s retuned resonance thickens toward a charged poise at the end. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the regime’s silence and her kneeling thanks reconfigure stakes without a loud decisive act. Cost is present (renunciation of spectacle, endurance across the freeze/thaw cycle) but remains mostly conceptual. Structure is clean, with one continuous frame widened by seasonal progress.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: a routine inquiry deepens into a memory‑field investigation culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending (leaving the lantern, accepting dismissal). Causality is inferential but consistent—empirical observation unlocks the 1852 surge reading and reframes the death. The final image carries cost and a before/after is legible. One more concrete obstacle in-scene would tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene causal spine with a clean tightening: months of failed attempts → storm‑lit insight → synchronized reassembly → earned stasis/CR in the ending. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (shop, vocation, object, vow), and the light‑triggered discovery reweights options rather than hand‑waving a fix. Cost is legible in the penitent grind and the relinquishing of force for listening. Quiet closure lands with the velvet‑wrapped exit and charged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: build the resonance through kaleidoscopic patterns to earn a bell response. Orientation lands early, and beats link causally (arrow → engine → kaleidoscope → humming → trigger → bell stir). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: not a ring but a charged whisper that reframes success with cost. The price is modest (strain, partial outcome), but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative drive is clean: recurring 0707 leads to a timed ritual in the deepest vault and a charged final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she becomes their anchor and redefines “deletion.” Cost is legible in the refusal to document/report and the implied personal risk. Orientation is clear early; causality is consistent within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the mirror‑sequence builds to the self‑confrontation and a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate (lighthouse orchard, ice floes), and the recurrent moves (beam, breath, shard) link beats coherently. Cost is soft but legible in the renunciation of fix/wholeness and the choice to continue carrying a “not whole” shard. The on‑page final question reconfigures the premise without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the pattern of listening culminates in the winch‑chime and glacier collapse, then reconfigures her stance (declining euthanasia). Orientation is clean early; the marina accident turns the pressure coherently. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (exposure, renunciation of a chosen death). One elegant, decisive tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single continuous scene under a situational/accumulative lens; pressure accrues through talk, demonstration, and a frost-sweet grape. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: Mara pockets the letter “as a map,” and Elias remains sentinel. The cost is chosen distance with reweighted meaning, legibly on the page. Slightly gentle turns keep it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through resonance, the parapet’s alignment, and the stabilization of clearings. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the pattern taught (ritual via peripheral awareness) pays off. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the place is consecrated; options reweighted; a price of attention and relinquishment is felt. No causality breaks or stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the sequence of photographs deepens a single stake until the latch “clicks like a promise kept.” Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits to the ritual with a felt but quiet cost. Orientation is crisp from the start (lavender field, rusted factory) and remains legible. The turns are tonal and conceptual rather than causal, yet coherent within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: ritual → anomaly (the “question”) → response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she relinquishes her practiced remove to speak, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clear from the outset and the object pattern pays off. The cost is quiet rather than dramatic, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rituals → directional driftwood → chalk screech → arrival at the tapes → auditory epiphany. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he hears it, drops the chalk, will forget; the driftwood and fog remain as priced residue. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the final image reweights earlier motifs with cost. Slight plot “stillness” is intentional and supports the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the spinning hand anchors a pattern that intensifies through synchronization (heartbeat → observatory → CMB) and resolves in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset; the moon’s shaking provides steady pressure. Closure lands on the page as time braids and the world stilled; the price is a surrender of linear causality and control. A hair of abstraction keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the hymns layer ordinary sounds until the shard sanctifies its own breakage and dissolves, reweighting the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—presence meets peace as souls reach for each other—and the tool is relinquished. Orientation is solid from the first line; the causal throughline is the ritual’s unfolding. Cost is legible in the letting‑go of instrument and role.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure coheres from discovery to ritual to threshold crossing to sealing partnership; the because/therefore chain is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she becomes “keeper of thresholds,” and noon now “casts a shadow on time.” Cost is mostly conceptual—responsibility and vigilance—rather than dramatized sacrifice, slightly softening impact. Orientation is anchored early (Vaelis, observatory, spoons) and held.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds from the riverbank revelation to the garden ritual, landing a resonant reconfiguration in the tooth’s final pulse. Who/where/when anchor early; one scene with clean progression. Closure cost is subtle but legible: she forecloses vengeance/clarity for a charged threshold. The pattern is taught and kept without lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: polishing → testing the glass against dim light → placement in the basin → communal witnessing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (quiet, public sharing of reflected light) with conceptual cost tethered to her vow and exile. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and set-ups (tools, mist, basin) pay off. The arc is subtle but coherent without causal stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural build is clean: the ritual progresses from entry to offering to the pivotal placement of the confession under moss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she commits to an ongoing practice (seeds, notebook) rather than cathartic finality. Cost is legible but quiet, hinging on public exposure she will carry forward. Orientation is crisp early; pattern holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural design is taught early and held; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes the talisman and begins anew on a pier. Cost is legible (“manuscript remained unfinished” yet she proceeds), with the shell and industry expectations as persistent constraints shaping the final image. Transitions are clear and the cadence shift lands decisively. No orientation debt; the lens remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural structure tightens cleanly: brittle tune → deepening hush → oak’s question → reclamation chorus → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the land’s song is rekindled and the wreath awaits the next singer. Cost is subtle—surrender to presence over spectacle—but legible as a chosen modality with a felt price. Orientation is anchored early; no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: the ritual’s patterned placements tighten into the blood‑seal, glow, hum, and pulse‑map realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with a living map and the world “resumes breathing,” a before/after shift with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp in the opening lines. Slight limitation: escalation remains gentle, with no sharp constraint beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece builds via patterned discoveries (11:03 glyph, 3:17 pulses) to a resonant reconfiguration where the broken timer becomes a fulcrum. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/what). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he leaves without repairing, archive complete, cost paid in renunciation and years spent. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, but legible in the final leave-taking and the silent, curated display.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure teaches its pattern and pays it off with an Earned Stasis: she turns the tool inward, accepting endurance over release. Orientation is clear immediately; causality lands via ritual mechanics leading to calcification. Cost is legible in “not to be free. But to endure.” A hair shy of 9+ only because escalation remains largely tonal rather than turning options sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: rain, tools, and kettle build toward a charged poise. Closure lands on the page when she places the half‑formed lion in light—an RR that reweights time and grief with the cost of inattention to the kettle. Orientation is clean from the outset. The throughline holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned collecting → confrontation → reweighting via the camera and letter. Closure lands on the page with cost when she surrenders the camera and accepts “frame, don’t fix,” shifting her tactic and self‑conception. Setups pay off (camera clicks, ghost’s lens-adjust gesture, spire). No orientation debt; the world and desire are clear early and used at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure advances coherently: observation → discovery (thermal flicker) → redirection → communal uptake → conceptual reframing. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a clean CR/RR at the end. Costs are modest but present (salvage, labor, partial decay persists), and the before/after is legible. It lacks a sharper pressure crest or cost at the close that would push it into exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly: discovery → installation → resonance → stance shift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he forecloses the cathedral-symphony path with a felt conceptual price and finds a new relation to silence. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when). Minor risk: the crystal’s agency is mystical but consistently handled, avoiding causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: one scene, pressure coheres from watchful waiting to a charged discovery and repricing. Closure lands as an earned stasis/CR—he shifts from chasing legends to honoring ruins—with cost implied in the relinquishment of pursuit. Orientation is clean early; set-ups (radio silence, sundial, salvage ethic) pay off. The cost is conceptual/emotional, not sharply dramatized, which keeps this below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative design holds: approach → offering → test of patience → instruction → redefinition at closure. Orientation is immediate (dock, fog, fulgurite), and patterning is consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“I’m collecting hands”), with a modest but present cost (commitment, endurance). Slight softness in explicit cost keeps it just shy of the 8.8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: one continuous scene, pattern taught early, closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis when the obituary is completed and buried. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent; the final act reweights presence/absence with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the outset. The constraint of “after the last ship” tightens timing without requiring a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive coheres: preparation → activation → world retunes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR—beauty stirs, birdsong returns, options reweighted though the egg remains uncertain. Cost is legible (years of erosion, risk of failure, acceptance of ongoing uncertainty). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: present‑scene ritual interleaved with backstory deepens pressure and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the coin is left submerged, and she commits to ongoing listening while re‑entering active service. Orientation is clear early (dunes, forbidden beach, obsidian lagoon), and each beat builds coherently to the figure’s witnessing and her binding act. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than perilous, but it’s legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: breadcrumbs → key → box → release → reweighted city. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the oldest fountain finally drops a bead of water and silence becomes presence. Cost is somewhat soft (the box is “lighter,” gratitude residue), but the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated pings, the gear’s shift, and the nebula’s brightening culminate in a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what) despite the lyric mode. The closure image—gear as “lighthouse without flame”—lands with conceptual cost (fragility, invisibility) on the page. The structure coheres as one scene increasing in density to a clean cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: butterflies arrive, Silas’s presence deepens, ribbons multiply, culminating in the grandmother’s ribbon and a repriced stance. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the closure is an on-page resonant reconfiguration (joining the current, beginning the next stone) with felt cost. Causality is poetic, not mechanical, but linkages are legible and purposeful. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, yet sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive holds: storm → discovery of hidden words → pause → renunciation. Closure lands on the page with cost (“not as a winder, but as a witness”), and the pendulum’s resumed swing reconfigures meaning. The rake‑inscription causality is clean and timely. Stakes and options are legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: cemetery → descent → tapestry decoding → stitching release → reconfigured worldview. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: graves become thresholds and her practice shifts accordingly. Causality within the lyric frame is clean (silo’s call → case’s needle → action that triggers the release). The cost is subtle but present in the renunciation of her prior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene accumulative design is coherent and anchored early; the drive lens holds through the ritual progression. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when “Begin.” dries and the spire pulses—an image that reweights the stakes from prediction to invitation with conceptual cost. Because/therefore linkages are lyric rather than causal, but the pattern teaches and pays off. Orientation is clean; the final image is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clean Decisive Change: receiver-to-transmitter. The escalation chain is tight—hotter dial → self‑naming lyric → tears as activation → she composes and cloaks her own broadcast. Cost is legible (emotional mourning, singed thumb, outlaw risk). The pattern is taught early and paid off in the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene under an accumulative/textural lens lands a clean Charged Poise: candle, shimmering powder, motionless chair, mask not removed. Orientation is clear from the opening, and set‑ups (chair’s timing; ash as ritual) pay off. The cost is conceptual/emotional but unmistakable on the page. Tight causal/effective links are modest yet coherent for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: layered discoveries, Council pressure, and the bell‑tower act culminate in a Charged Poise/CR ending (sundial shadows moving underwater). Orientation is early and clean; the piece coheres as one window with a patterned mosaic. Cost is legible on the page (refused reintegration, chosen exile) and the final image reweights the central stake (depth vs height). The water’s slight shift is an apt, quiet cadence change rather than a plot solve.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens is clear: density of silence and motifs deepens until the creak, then the question, then the invitation. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she chooses to continue by teaching one student, with the cost of long waiting and vulnerability implied on the page. Orientation is firm from the opening sentence. The tightening sequence (listening → approach → consent to teach) is clean and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pruning → planting → sprout → reweighted greenhouse. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the sapling entwining iron and the community implication. The cost is subtle yet legible; the once-in-a-lifetime alignment and “rust meets root” prophecy bind causality without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causal chain is clean: riddle → guided ascent → discovery → reframe. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“It collects belief”) supported by prior particulars. Orientation is immediate and the pattern holds to the final image of humming drones. The felt cost is subtle rather than acute, slightly limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: placement → hush → sensing houses → release of the cottage’s grip lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words (who, where, when, method). Closure cost is present but subtle—the dissolution by tide and her ongoing, chosen burden of noticing. The pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each revelation tightens into the act of breaking the ampoule, leading to a conceptual repricing and felt cost. Closure lands on the page with the statue’s dissolution and the historian’s charged mandate. Orientation is clear early (underwater garden, statue, diver), and the causal throughline (discover → decode → decide → cascade) is clean. The persistent constraint of the environment and plinth fracture shapes tactics at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated attempts (carve → speak) tighten into a cadence shift where the staircase ripples and he touches the origami‑folded moment. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/what). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he relinquishes the relic to internalize the missed chance, without halting the climb. The price is felt on the page in the die’s disappearance and the chosen endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated glyph‑acts build a field that culminates in the teen’s arrival and the collaborative painting—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. The moon/brush constraint persists and shapes tactics, and the billboard/compelled kindness beats pay off prior set‑ups. Cost is quiet but present: she relinquishes solitude/privacy to extend the work beyond herself. Orientation is crisp from the opening line; no causality breaks in the magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a pattern of offerings (bread, lens, glimmers) intensifies to a community performance and a reweighted ending. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the city shifts from elegy to renaissance—capped by “We are becoming it” and the waterfall’s “approval.” The cost is conceptual and social (risking grief, the labor of ongoing practice) and is present on the page. Minor reliance on summary over dramatized turns keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: yoyo core → mainspring → lighthouse reversal → stone bloom → gear retrieval → world-scale reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when), and the drive lens holds to a decisive on-page change. Closure is strong: he alters the world and accepts a personal burden as the stone dissolves and the lighthouse fissures. No major plot amnesia or convenience patches.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/causal throughline is tight: dictionary → incantation → charged pause → unbosoming → confrontation with mirrored Fear. Orientation is clean from the first lines (post‑resuscitation, funhouse). Closure lands with a decisive internal reconfiguration and visible cost. Setups (clasp, luminance, “reflection”) pay off in the final dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: cloud‑score → wave‑xylophone → blackening sea → root‑note and fruit percussion → apprentice’s strike. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the system releases into harmonic rain and the tide turns inward. Causality is legible within the world’s rules; the price is modest but present (exhaustion, transfer of instrument/role). Orientation is crisp from line one; no lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern language work → watcher’s head turn → decisive plan constitutes a coherent tightening. Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost signaled (“become part of the legend”); while not enacted, it reconfigures options and stakes. Orientation is clean early and remains stable. Minor limitation: the decisive act is deferred, keeping cost largely implied rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: discovery → interpretation → plan → charged poise in the final image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the petal drop and spring release reweight the myth with a felt social cost, though the price is largely implied. Causality is clean and contained in one scene with a forward‑looking strategy. Limited on‑page opposition keeps turns modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual note‑placing densifies until the pivotal copper tube discovery and the “last drops” copying, producing an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible on the page (ink exhausted, emotional unarmoring) and reconfigures meaning: the pavilion “sighs,” now layered with witnessed absence. Orientation is clean from the opening groaning drawbridge through dawn resurfacing. The ending tightens options—she chooses a path of ongoing devotion rather than extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery of the ledger → architectural anomalies → preserved Master Index → vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a felt, if primarily conceptual, cost (surfacing to speak against suppression under blackout). Orientation is crisp from the first line; no causality breaks. Slight softness in on‑page price keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: basilica hums → shadow ascends → Silas shatters lanterns to feed it dreams → final sapphire polishing and drop. Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost and an earned reconfiguration (shadow gone, crane embodied). Orientation is firm despite the lyric texture; the pattern is taught and paid off. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric accumulation that never muddies turns.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: simulations fail, residuals yield coordinates, she commits and launches—closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the causal chain is crisp without artifice. The price is emotionally legible—solitude, grief, and irrevocable pursuit—but not materially tested beyond departure. One deeper on‑page complication before launch could have tightened options further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene structure moves cleanly from breach to discovery to activation to repricing, with the closure landing on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration (choosing presence over pursuit). The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held through the harmonic and memory beats. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forecloses the external‑hunt identity for a quieter stance. Minor limitation: external stakes foreshadowed (spectral resonance) do not materially constrain the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure holds a tight single-scene arc with a clear accumulative-to-causal deepening: terrace → shore → carving → memory → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she reframes her father and forecloses her old trade with visible cost. Setups (watch hand, carvings, hush) pay off cleanly without late rule‑changes. Orientation is crisp from the first line; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene situational design coheres, with an RR/Charged Poise closure when they exchange relics and walk off together. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph, and the persistent constraint (history, guilt) shapes tactics. Cost is felt in the demand to name the erased and in giving up talismans. The closure is quiet but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image patterns (poles, compass, tide) intensify and reweight the stake until the charged final act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she launches, using the compass as witness rather than guide, and the needle points to her stern. The cost—abandoning star‑precision and accepting imperfect motion—is legible in the final beat. Single scene coherence, no causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clues → descent → water’s reveal → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the seeker releases the baseball and chooses to climb without it; cost is the relinquished talisman and forfeited certainty. Orientation is clean early (where/who/why), and the world rules (lake “remembers choices”) are taught through action. No causal breaks; the pattern pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: spices → shimmer → spark → hybrid phoenix. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by the first paragraph, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“not out of the orchard, but into its deeper truth”). The cost is subtle but legible in the chosen in‑between state. A touch more tightening around a single pivotal beat could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual intensifies into the saucer-threshold and the archive, culminating in a reconfiguration (grief → grace) with on‑page cost. Orientation is taught early (midnight glade above clouds; cartomancer; satchel) and remains coherent. Setups pay off (saucer crack opening, hand-tracing returning as spectral hands). Closure lands cleanly with the saucer healed by surrender and a reweighted final option (descend as mother).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: set‑ups (photos, Tear, emotional gravity) pay off causally in the final stitching. Closure lands on the page with cost—the Tear dissolves, the ship is relinquished—and options reconfigure decisively. Orientation is clear early and the gate scene is legible. The persistent constraint (emotional calibration measured in “grams of levity per heartbeat”) shapes tactics through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clean and held: sequential releases deepen pressure and meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the world’s hush, volcano sleeping, final trail: “HERE. NOW. YOU.”) with a conceptual cost—the acceptance of belonging and lost paths. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when set in opening lines). A slight softness remains in concrete on‑page price, but it’s sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece tightens from rampart watch to courtyard action to rooftop charged poise. Closure lands in a quiet, resonant final image (dawn seep; copies in workers’ hands) that reweights prior imagery without tying knots. Cost is implied more than felt; still, the pattern coheres and the ending reframes options. Orientation is early and clean; setups (blackout, bell clock, sundial) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is coherent: set the pattern, draw the eels, receive the memory, reprice the curse, place the final stone. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the curse shifts from seconds to patterns and the promise is redefined as method, not answers. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when, frictionless rule), and set-ups pay off (painted rocks, grandmother’s maxim, star dust). The only softness is the relatively low overt cost, though it is thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the timer’s countdown and storm’s crescendo pattern a tightening that leads to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The before/after is legible at zero: she refuses action, accepting cost and preserving the vigil. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks. A minor softness: the central conflict remains purely internal, limiting structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene with coherent accumulative drive: waiting → alignment → decoding → decision. Orientation is immediate (atrium, sundial, brook) and causality within the puzzle is clean. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: they choose to perform the recovered Accord and leave the tool behind. The price is conceptual rather than dramatized—more vow than sacrifice—keeping this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: poem → candle → reading → seeds → song, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset and sustained in one continuous scene. Closure lands on the page with Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses the cynic’s stance and enacts rebuilding at personal risk (“sirens wailed… silence held court”). The final charged image (lullaby in a ruin‑cathedral) reweights prior material decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive (causal/accumulative) holds: music → compasses → clock ticking → final chord → dawn rupture is cleanly motivated. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the rules are learned via action. Closure lands on the page with cost (film reel sacrificed; time unfreezes) and a decisive shift in world-state plus charged poise (laughter behind her). Setups (compasses, clock, instruction) all pay off without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene causal flow is clean: early bloom → urgency → ritual → tremor/awakening → autonomous archive. Closure lands on-page with cost (“The knowledge fruit seed was gone”) and reconfiguration (self-correcting archive). The drive lens reads Hybrid with a dominant Accumulative/Textural cadence paid off by the ridge’s charged final glow. Minor soft spot: the operation faces no significant external obstacle beyond the tremor/doubt spike.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual density increases, the color rises, then diffuses, and the compass calms. Orientation is clean early; the Severance context integrates without stalling. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (redistribution of sorrow; renunciation of hoarding regret). Cost is quiet and could be sharper, but the before/after is legible.
