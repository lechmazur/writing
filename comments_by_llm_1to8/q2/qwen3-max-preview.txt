  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through dust-pattern observations that reweight Elira's understanding from neutron-star scale to terrestrial decay. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the "I found them here, in the dust" realization) with conceptual cost—she has abandoned her field and repurposed her career. Orientation is clear by paragraph two (who, where, post-flood). One tightening: the logarithmic spiral discovery that mirrors her neutron models, narrowing her interpretive stance. Cost is conceptual and felt in the career pivot, legible in the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (canyon, stars, glass artist). The closure unit—gifting glass to those who "listen to the canyon's breath"—lands as conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("not emptiness, but the echo of everything worth keeping") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or choice. The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode, yet the final reconfiguration relies on summary ("she realized") and visitors who arrive off-page, weakening the on-page proof of cost. The ledger's "map of survival" revelation is coincidence that complicates without forcing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates emotional thermals and tuning-fork activations toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist realizes she can "hear" through skin and bone). However, the closure moment lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply gains capability without trade-off. The thermal-mapping method is recounted in past tense ("she'd spent months developing") rather than tested under present pressure, weakening causality at the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: weary undertaker, drowned Vaelith, underwater library refuge. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered signals, soul impressions, and the final transformation of distress into belonging. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the undertaker's choice to walk deeper rather than surface forecloses rescue/escape with visible cost (his hands no longer tremble, he commits to more signals). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the lens broadcasts rather than breaks, tightening his stake from burial to release.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accretes through repeated basket deliveries and the bell's shifting presence. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (arbor, Elira, exile community, sanctions). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the bell's ringing and the passing of baskets, but the cost remains abstract; no specific option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The piece teaches a pattern of accretion but the final image ("passed into other hands") declares rather than demonstrates the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within bounds. The quest ("find the pilgrim") follows the tear's trajectory using breath modulation, establishing causal linkage. However, the ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the reservoir is sung, not stored) without visible cost: the artist receives the answer, the viaduct blooms brighter, no option foreclosed. The piece teaches an accumulative lens but the closure reconfiguration lacks felt price or trade-off on the page, reducing the landing to reception rather than transformation with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive immediately (maze designer, living bridge garden, halo fragment above), and the story teaches an accumulative-textural lens by midpoint. The closure unit—Elira's final tactile cataloguing of time's texture—operates as Conceptual Repricing: the garden has consumed her photographs and she shifts from external anchors to direct sensory contact with duration itself. However, the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized in a decisive image; the photographs "disintegrate" and she weeps, but the final paragraph lists discoveries without showing what she forfeited or what path closed. Under an accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, yet the closing catalogue feels like summary of findings rather than a moment that reweights prior pressure with undeniable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (chained liberator, carnival, raiders). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression and charged final images. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the liberator's walk scatters seeds and reweights the opening captivity into inevitability ("quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative"). However, the cost remains more asserted than felt—no on-page sentence shows what she forfeits or loses by walking into dawn with chains still on. The mechanics of vault-opening and seed-scattering advance causally, but the final image's cost is oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (greenhouse, aurora, shipwrecks by line 2) and the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery—forge fed by absences, color-sounds, cellular countdown—culminating in the crack of trust breaking and the forged memory-catcher. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she leaves with the device, her work done because she's "harvested the silence and turned it into a compass," foreclosing return with visible cost (body thin, spirit scarred). Cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she hears the crack and pulls the device free, narrowing her task to completion. The lens holds without contradiction, though the "cells divide" motif and marrow-scope feel ornamental rather than causally integral to the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (emerald station, moonlight, thief's role) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the thief deposits moonbeams and flowers at two stations, creating parallel reunions that demonstrate her method without a causal linkage forcing escalation. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"she wasn't altering fate—she was translating it"—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action forecloses a path or imposes a felt price. The final image (jar nearly empty, soul brimming) asserts balance without dramatizing what she renounced or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early; the temporal frame ("during ice melting") remains atmospheric rather than a tightening constraint. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sphere-creation builds density and the final reprise of the bookmark and child reweights the opening abandonment motif. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the glassblower smiles, her heart already transformed, with no path foreclosed or price paid on the page. The child's future discovery is projected, not dramatized, weakening the RR's on-page legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layering gothic imagery, metaphorical language, and backstory fragments toward a thematic climax), but the piece does not tighten or deepen pressure meaningfully—beats are additive loops of discovery rather than escalation. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerge slowly through ornamental description, though the library anchor eventually lands. The closure—burning the reel and walking away—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("baptized in trembling certainty") rather than felt through a forfeited relationship, resource, or choice that narrows future options. The Conceptual Repricing hinges on the protagonist's internal reframing, yet prior causality does not compel this exact resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece attempts closure via density and recurrence. However, the ending offers no decisive change, no visible cost, and no clear reweighting—only a tonal assertion ("marbled hush: striated, calm") that the oracle "vanished into the night she had drawn." Orientation is present early (oracle, ridge fort, storm). Causality is absent: the oracle's actions (tracing pages, whispering summaries) never narrow options or alter her situation; she simply walks away at the end without dramatized consequence or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held throughout: loops accrete fragments until a pattern break (the whisper from within) triggers the pivot from external to internal search. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—the robot's question transforms into "a quiet hum of belonging"—with visible cost (the violin melts, the external quest is abandoned). The loop structure is signaled by paragraph six and paid off systematically. Orientation is swift (sentient robot, frozen courtyard, post-procedure, twilight). One meaningful deepening occurs when the voice redirects the search inward, narrowing options and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (thaw via transparency) intended. The closure image—lens cracking, keepers embracing, tickets fading—signals resolution, but the cost is abstract: no prior tactic or relationship is visibly foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off; the lens simply "works" without friction or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—she refuses compliance, the garden "consents," fireflies spiral in recognition—with felt cost (isolation, bureaucratic opposition). Orientation anchors who/where/when early (vine dresser, garden maze, post-luck-measurement era). The accumulative lens holds: density increases through polished marbles, each commemorating a victory, culminating in the altar moment and firefly response that reweights the premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she refuses the intern and the garden answers, crystallizing reciprocity versus measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—proving lateral time—is signaled in the first third and drives the lever-pull at midpoint, which triggers the adjacency vision and the final recalibration. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensor logs, glyph discovery, and the nexus convulsion, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when Elira names the phenomenon ("Time doesn't move forward here. It breathes sideways"). Cost is conceptual—she maps adjacent presents no one else will understand—but the final image (synth-tea steam curling "like a question mark") charges the closure without a felt interpersonal or opportunity price on the page, keeping it mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered imagery and the program's gradual revelation, culminating in a wordless "performance" that dissolves the ghost. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost gains peace, she gains purpose), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—what path is foreclosed, what price paid? Orientation anchors (musician, flooded opera house, lantern, present night) arrive early. The escalation from study to performance is a single meaningful deepening, sufficient for this length, but the final image ("the flood...had composed its masterpiece") tells theme rather than letting action reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elira endures her brokenness and begins to "weigh the truth...in breaths reclaimed, in steps forward," forecloses the path of continued silence with visible cost (exposure to cold, pinning the illustration to weather). The Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held: the smudge, the oracle's responses, the auroral light, and the pinned illustration accumulate and reweight the dominant stake. Orientation is prompt (station, fever breaking, dawn) and the lens remains coherent through closure. Cost is legible in the act of pinning the illustration and stepping back inside altered.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (explorer, tunnel, post-confession timeframe). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she recognizes the "ghost shift" as her own grief machinery, reweights the valve wheel from haunted object to personal prop, and accepts the burden ("not lighter, but steadier"). Cost is visible—she must carry her father's truth forward without phantom alibi—and the lens is Causal-Hybrid with accumulative texture. One meaningful tightening occurs when the radio plays her own voice back, collapsing external haunt into internal recursion. The piece slightly over-explains the thematic mechanism ("guilt rewinds time") where image alone could suffice, edging toward tell at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear late (the keeper's role and the obsidian refuge are named early, but spatial and temporal grounding remains vague past 120 words). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered imagery and the final act of writing offers a reconfiguration of stance. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—what option was foreclosed by witnessing is not legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (entry into the refuge's interior and emergence), but the before/after change in the keeper's capabilities or choices is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    The eclipse arrives as coincidence and provides spectacle but not causal pressure. Elara's actions (singing, showing the curl) do not narrow options or test her mission; the gathering happens to her rather than because of her choices. The ending image (curl in the girl's palms, humming as she walks away) offers a mood but no decisive change or visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized. Orientation is clear early, but the closure lacks felt consequence under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the historian packs tools and commits to descend, crystallizing stakes ("realign the stories...so the world might remember how to stand upright") with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The accumulative lens holds—discovery stacks pressure through diary fragments, tapestry cross-reference, wall whispers—and one meaningful deepening occurs when "the displaced axis wasn't random. It was a wound." Minor orientation delay (historian's name "dissolved into footnotes" without grounding who/where until "silo library") costs −0.2, but the effect pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece signals early who/where/what but lacks a single continuous causal spine; it's a mosaic of anecdotes (widow, teenager, analyst arrival) without clear escalation or a decisive change at closure. The analyst's arrival and hiring feel like an additive coda rather than a reversal that narrows Elias's options or reweights prior stakes. The final image—"kept transposing life into a new key—one cookie, one tide, one heart at a time"—restates the premise rather than reconfiguring it with visible cost. No moment forecloses a path or crystallizes a choice; the lighthouse "swept on, indifferent," but so does the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (rhetorical excavation as defense) and maintains coherent symbolic pressure through layered questions and the indigo palette. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the priest realizes the possession "wasn't invading—it was answering," then disperses it into the question itself. The cost is conceptual (the possessed entity unraveled into stillness) and legible in the final image, though the emotional or relational price remains oblique. Orientation is secure by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered memory-mapping and mirrored imagery, but no decisive tightening or cost emerges at closure. The ending presents a smile and a warm shell—essentially a mood statement—without visible forfeiture or reconfigured stakes. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words of abstract meditation. The "before exhaustion hits" timeframe is mentioned twice but never pressures a tactical choice or final threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with deliberate spatial disorientation (hovering atop viaduct, procedural corridors) that never anchors who/where/when by ~120 words; causality remains opaque throughout. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via confession-driven merging, but the shift from running to speaking lacks on-page motivation—no because/therefore link explains why confessions now dissolve echo-selves. Cost is asserted ("cracks spiderwebbing") but the protagonist pays no legible price; the tablet blooms and echoes rush to merge without forfeiture or stance crystallization. Drive lens wobbles between lyric accumulation and causal problem-solving without committing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure lands on-page with Charged Poise: Elara no longer fears the void and carries it as potential, the filament now "resilient, now radiant," and the final image (hands on drums, needle on groove, "The world, reversed, ready to be felt") crystallizes the reconfigured stance with cost implied through her prior numbness and the risk of facing pain inside-out. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through the backward-song experiment, the cavern's resonance thickens, and the ending reweights the dominant stake (defeating numbness) via cadence shift and image charge. Minor orientation slip: "the faint rustle of turning seasons" arrives late and functions more as atmosphere than clear temporal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Situational (Elias faces mounting pressure that crystallizes his stance). Orientation anchors are present early: courtyard, dusk, Elias home from work. The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—he steps into the rail yard with tools and covenant, options reweighted, cost felt in the forfeiture of official channels and the embrace of lateral investigation. One meaningful tightening: the message tube narrows options from passive observation to active, unsanctioned inquiry. Cost is legible ("letting his meticulous nature become his camouflage," abandoning Bureau safety). No causality breaks; the sequence of discovery → decision → movement holds under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.9)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural through the grotto nights, but the village-square climax pivots to situational without teaching the shift. The rope's "revelation" (frays = record) is told by narrator assertion rather than dramatized through the poet's changing tactics. Closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (the rope becomes a bridge metaphor), but the cost is purely social and off-page; no felt or visible sacrifice by the protagonist anchors the final image. Orientation is present but vague: "seven moons" and "the week the energy beings descended" float without concrete anchor to present action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early and remain stable. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lira's playing gathers intensity through linked images (vines stir, hatch opens, child descends) toward the petal moment, which reweights prior material. However, no decisive on-page reversal narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost—the petal floats as affirmation, not costly choice. The closure reconfigures mood but lacks the pressure or cost test required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing at this rubric's standard.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and sustains it through layered sensory and conceptual density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Vael smashes her vials and redefines her role from dealer to conduit. The cost is legible: she forfeits market standing and patron network, and the final image ("Bring me your broken feelings") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "at dusk" and "as the transformation completes" create mild temporal fuzziness that resolves without harm. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, and the closure lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias receives the locket, replicates it, delivers five envelopes, witnesses responses, receives a reciprocal envelope, and delivers again. The closure—standing under stars listening to communal joy—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts the role of architect), but the felt cost is minimal; no live option is foreclosed, and the cycle's continuation feels thematically declared rather than pressure-tested. The causal chain is legible but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; when is gestural ("beyond the murmur of lost languages") but does not obscure the present scene. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sculptures accumulate, tags and notes layer, culminating in the arbor ritual that crystallizes Lira's acceptance. Closure (arbor dedication, figures emerge, sculptures shift function) lands on the page, but cost is implied through vocabulary ("no longer pleaded") rather than a visible forfeiture or altered tactic. The deepening is present but diffuse across many micro-beats without one sharp tightening that narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (rooftop canals, giant's nap, illustrator) arrive early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory layering and the pattern of time-borrowing until the chamber scene reweights the stakes. However, the closure—releasing echoes and closing the sketchbook—feels like a forecast fulfilled rather than a reversal or deepening that narrows options. The cost (pendant heat fading, borrowed time anchored by illustrations) is asserted but not dramatized in a single legible image, weakening the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elira, cavern orchard, post-silence) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density rises as equations, glass eyes, and fruit-light converge into Aris's hidden message and Elira's comprehension. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she grasps that the shared language persists and will seek Aris with new understanding—but the cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible path is foreclosed on the page. The midpoint realization ("silence wasn't emptiness. It was resonance.") deepens the stake, and the final fruit-as-compass image reweights prior material, meeting the RR bar for this length. Minor causality slip: the orchard's glow strengthens "because she finally understood," which leans toward reward rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening beat; no penalty applies. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning toward visibility) with felt cost: the dweller remains hidden yet achieves connection, foreclosing pure isolation. The dominant stake (becoming visible to those who need you) is signaled early and tightens when she places the fragment where it will be found. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of sensory echoes and cached objects builds pressure, and the staff notice completes the reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in her decision to defer full emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure—Lindy's transmutation and the protagonist's behavioral shift—occurs off-page during the storm interlude; we see only the aftermath ("Lindy was gone—not fallen, but transmuted"). The dominant stake (decoding the leaf's persistence) is signaled early but the resolution bypasses causal linkage: the protagonist's weeping and page-tearing do not mechanically cause the leaf's glow or transformation, and no on-page cost is legible at the moment of change. The final image reconfigures the nursery arrangement, but the conceptual price—what she forfeited to arrive there—remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (insomniac painter, tidal island studio, post-water-wars). The accumulative lens coheres: rain trails guide discovery, objects accumulate meaning, and the journal revelation deepens rather than reverses the brooch's significance. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—the exchange ritual and subsequent sleep reweight loss into legacy with visible cost (brooch, canvas, brush surrendered). The felt price is legible when she trades her work for rest, though the seaglass arrival risks softening that cost with a prompt return gift.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The piece offers a resonant reconfiguration where the clairvoyant understands the unseen forces were always part of her sought magic, but the closure unit leans on retrospective epiphany ("she had forgotten") rather than forward pressure that forecloses a path. The cost—accepting what she unknowingly summoned—is felt but arrives through explanation rather than dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elira gathers fragments (valve, memories, notations) that accrete into a navigation chart of absence, culminating in the seasonal naming ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the town adopts a new tradition that reweights loss as coordinate rather than void—and the conceptual cost (accepting absences as permanent yet navigable) is legible in the final image of the untouched valve. The two-shard structure (archive work, then council presentation and first ritual) remains coherent within one contiguous post-exile window. Orientation anchors appear early (ivory harbor, Elira's role, post-exile timeframe), and the escalation—fragments to scroll to ritual—tightens the dominant stake (honoring loss without erasure) through one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story provides early spatial anchoring (starlit vault, flagstone) and a coherent descent structure. However, the closure unit—the obsidian door shattering into whispers—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; "she was remade" is told rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or altered capability. The causal linkage between pressing the punch and the door's dissolution works under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the final transformation lacks the sharp before/after that makes cost unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established clearly (tower, cliff, dusk, Elira alone with the tile). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the tile unfolds memories, the whale song syncs with the pulse, and Elira transcribes a "score" rather than solving a mystery. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she completes the transcription and leaves it for "the next one who needs to hear"), which reweights her purpose from personal discovery to communal gift. However, the cost is largely conceptual and implied—her skepticism softens, but no on-page option is visibly foreclosed or sacrificed. The causal linkage between touching the tile and choosing to archive the parchment is thin; the decision feels meditative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (immortal, prismatic escondite, solar storm) land by the third paragraph. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern break—"spatial mutiny" inverts geometry as the amulet fragments, then the final step and kneel deliver Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize in "the pulse of final goodbyes, gentle as a breath, relentless as tides." Cost is felt in the collapse of his sanctuary ("winked out") and the vulnerability of kneeling. The lens holds without contradiction, and the closure reweights the premise: wonder returns not through spectacle but through endings' "quiet thunder." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: the child waits in the prep room, uses the ink, witnesses its effect on others, then departs with intent to find the father. Orientation anchors (funeral home, midnight, the child alone) arrive early. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—the child walks out "the mathematics of fair trade humming beneath their ribs" and plans to bring the pen to the father—but the cost remains abstract and future-facing rather than paid on the page. The escalation from solitary use to communal ritual to architect-of-fairness is more thematic accumulation than causal tightening, and the ink's magical properties resolve opposition without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who: gilded-leaf stationer; where: mountaintop bonsai forest; when: dawn after town silence) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through the discovery of an "Unknown Era" that wasn't her invention, then the realization that others have planted fictions here, culminating in the offering of the notepad—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she leaves her archive open and walks deeper, reconfiguring her solitary collection into potential collaboration. Cost is legible: she relinquishes exclusive control and the certainty of her invented histories. One minor causality question—how the fluorescent lamp "carries frequencies" is told rather than demonstrated—but the overall arc holds under the accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer toward a reconfigured stance on erasure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the first two paragraphs. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final declarations ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting"), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture, tactical shift, or sacrifice is legible. The ending recapitulates the opening stance without a felt before/after or undeniable pressure that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who, where, and what early. The closure unit—myth buster stops seeking answers, walks away with shell fragments—qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost (courage to stop seeking) is asserted rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible price. The compass shattering and shell cracking function as symbolic markers rather than causal beats that narrow tactics. The riddle's answer ("What do you bury when you refuse to speak?") arrives as epiphany without prior friction that made silence a live stake.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: murals bloom overnight, pressure builds through graffiti campaign, and the ending reconfigures the city's stance via collective action. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—privatization stalls, contracts unsigned, developers meet organized resistance—but the cost is diffuse and institutional rather than felt on Lira's body or choices. The before/after is legible (from pending privatization to postponement), yet the resolution arrives through collective off-page action ("hundreds gather," "their blueprints graffitied") rather than a decisive on-page choice by the protagonist that forecloses a path with visible personal price. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's lyric catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the inspector bears witness, the hourglass completes its cycle, and she descends carrying the knowledge with visible cost (the isolation, the futility). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery and the chemical mechanism, culminating in the label and final whisper. The Orientation Test passes cleanly (who/where/when by opening lines). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final grain falls and she realizes the message was meant to be unheard, reweighting her vigil from archival to communion. Cost is felt in the final image: "You outlasted them all."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece accumulates sensory texture and the anchor-lifting frame, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the drone is broken, then fixed through uncontested steps. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the drone's flight reweights Elara's purpose), yet the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or trade-off is legible in the final image. The transition to the music box gesture nods at continuation but does not deepen prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: condensation blooms, fragments accrue, and the final spiral reweights the search. However, causality is thin—why does whispering translations cause condensation to map watersheds? The phrasebook's mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the protagonist stops editing and starts witnessing), but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The ending image recharges prior material, yet the path from fragments to spiral lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered imagery (footsteps → ripples → flickers → embodied echoes) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tuner leaves the fork and the town "breathes" in shared balance. Cost is felt in her departure and the fork's abandonment, which forecloses her return. The orientation anchor is late (dawn, archway, Virelle named, but "who" remains cryptic past 120 words); apply −0.3. The accumulative method holds, and the closure image reweights "collapse" into "continuity."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance as Earned Stasis) at closure, and the cost—death—is legible on the page. However, orientation anchors arrive late: we learn "distress signal sender" and her submersible setup before her name, agency, or immediate spatial position are clear, creating minor disorientation in the opening ~150 words. The vial's activation functions as the single meaningful tightening, and the temple's response provides causal payoff. The closure image (fragments as "seeds of remembrance") attempts to reweight the sacrifice but edges toward thematic summary rather than pure dramatization, slightly weakening the final beat's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse beam now carries unsilenced truth, reweighting the premise of the "cry wolf" legacy with undeniable conceptual cost (the boy will be called mad, but the truth is sustained). The causal lens holds—each action (finding lattice, wedging it into mechanism, pressing it into lens) narrows options and changes what the light can do. Orientation anchors arrive late: "lighthouse prison" and "iron gate" appear early, but "who" remains unclear until the father's legacy is mentioned at line 4, past the ~120-word gate. Apply −0.3 for delayed anchoring that forces re-reading. The tightening is meaningful (spectral witnesses → sealing them into light), and the cost is felt in the final image of the boy slumped, called mad but triumphant.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric preamble, triggering the −0.3 penalty and the Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure unit—fruit bearing runes, Elara tasting nectar—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (debt passed as gift), and cost is legible in the bride's dissolution. However, the causal chain from bead-touch to Elara's epiphany to orchard awakening relies on summary assertion ("the bead warmed instantly, its resonance syncing") rather than dramatized pressure, weakening the earned quality of the turn. Under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative atmosphere → thin Causal hinge at the bead exchange → Accumulative closure), the closure holds but the middle hinge is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery meant to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within acceptable range. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the plate's transformation and the weaver's vow to return, but no visible cost appears on the page—the plate "warmed," "pulsed," succeeds without trade-off or forfeiture. The final paragraphs summarize future intent ("she would return tomorrow") rather than landing a decisive present-moment change or charged poise with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening ("Elara, a diaspora returnee") but the dominant stake—restoring communal faith versus personal belief—remains diffuse until the sundial reassembly crystallizes near the end. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (petals, roots, artifacts layer meaning), but the closure lacks a decisive tightening: villagers arrive with seeds and songs, validating Elara's effort without on-page cost or trade-off. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies: "catacomb orchard" and "sundial base" are named early, but their spatial and temporal relationship to Elara's excavation remains vague past 120 words, and the effect does not charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but no causal turn or meaningful tightening occurs. The piece describes a ritual already complete—chalk laid, widow's message encoded—without dramatizing a choice that narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending ("Already half-gone, half-alive, waiting...") offers a thematic Echo rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. No before/after in stakes or stance is legible; the protagonist remains in the same contemplative posture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only gradually across the first third, though the pattern is eventually legible (−0.3 applied here; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated stitching beats and the flame's tremor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she sleeps beside the completed work. However, cost at closure is asserted rather than shown on the page—"They called her a fool still, even as they bowed" tells us the outcome without dramatizing the felt price of her renunciation or exhaustion. The causal chain from adjacent-layer witness to counter-pattern sabotage to loyalist victory relies heavily on summary rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (shard, letters, leaf-windows, moonlight) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors who and where early, but "when" remains vague (night, but no prior situation or pressing clock). The closure—letters dissolving, shard planted, path revealed—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallized, cost felt in memory erasure), but the cost is told retrospectively ("each mended tear steals a memory") rather than dramatized in the ending beat. The causal chain is thin: moonlight heals, letters vanish, path appears—more sequential magic than because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final stance—carrying pain with grace, kinship blooming in fracture—reweights her initial goal with felt cost (she neither heals nor escapes, but witnesses and breathes). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the atrium mist, coral warmth, and cast scribbles layer toward a cadence shift in the final paragraph that deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by paragraph three (Mira, atrium, anesthetic hum, twilight). The cost is legible in the shift from "lotus-hearted ache" as grief to kinship, and the quiet acceptance that the wound remains but is now carried differently.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Elira in the ruined orchard, her art form, and her discovery of the fresco fragment. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: gathering oral histories deepens context, the noon projection accumulates sensory and emotional density, and the final image reweights the fragment from relic to key. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fragment's meaning and Elira's purpose shift decisively) with felt cost (she pockets preservation in favor of future creation). One friction: the oral-history sequence (Havel, Liora) functions as strategic telling that compresses research but does not generate on-page friction or reversal; the escalation arrives only at the projection beat, making the middle feel like setup rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors WHO and WHERE by the opening lines; WHEN emerges via the framing phrase "pause between question and reply" but remains metaphoric rather than situational. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory layering and the nickel's escalating involvement until the mural "awakens" and migrates into Elira. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights her stance from restoration to curiosity—but cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint is dramatized on the page, weakening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a Situational lens (pressure from the surveillance state forces stance crystallization) but delivers closure as diffuse social change rather than a single crystallized moment with on-page cost. The gourd seed is planted, Dr. Vex becomes an ally, and the piece leaps to a future where "the Bureau finally noticed"—but that noticing happens off-page, summarized rather than dramatized. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence in the final beat shows the protagonist paying a visible price or foreclosing a path. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, tax regime, protagonist role) arrive clearly within the first 120 words, waiving that penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early). The dominant stake—transmuting pain into beauty through song—is signaled and sustained. The postcard's new line ("They're listening") registers as a micro turn, and the final image (continuing to sing, postcard humming, reef glowing) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she chooses to persist in her vigil with "something like rest" in the spaces between words). However, the cost is conceptual and implied rather than legible on the page; no concrete option is foreclosed, no visible price paid in the closure beat. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending reprises the opening posture without a decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly within the opening moves and teaches an accumulative/textural lens through recurring motifs (chime, light, names). However, no on-page decisive change, renunciation with visible cost, or meaningful reconfiguration occurs—the caretaker performs the same ritual at story's end as at the beginning with identical satisfaction and no path foreclosed. The closing image of the chime "nestled against her chest like a sleeping bird" reprises the status quo rather than reweighting it. Accumulative designs require a cadence shift or density break that alters stakes; here the ritual simply loops.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: who (linguist), where (archive), when (after the Great Silence). The causal lens holds: she deciphers glyphs → discovers musical notation → reconstructs vows → conducts the restoration. The closure lands on-page with the collective singing and the glass ink well's final chime, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (trust begins to rebuild). Cost is present but muted—years to rebuild fully—rather than a sharp forfeiture in the climactic moment, and the path from solo scholarship to communal performance compresses quickly without visible friction or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with strong spatial anchors (amphitheater, volcano) and establishes a central question (reconciling rigid calculus with fluid mercy). However, causality is weak: the adhesive analysis leads her to the amphitheater, but what she does there—humming, copying symbols—does not demonstrably alter her options or knowledge in a way that changes the floodgate problem on the page. The ending narrates future recalibration as intent rather than showing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, recurring motifs), but closure depends on a summary of off-page actions rather than an on-page reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (dust motes, meteorite, pigeon flight) toward a pattern-break closure when the melody returns and Elara stops reinventing herself. Orientation anchors (attic, pigeons, Elara) land by paragraph four, within acceptable range. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise): "The ledgers stayed open, ink drying in honest lines. Her history wasn't a forgery anymore—it was a composition, still being written, still being flown." The cost is conceptual—she forecloses the escape of reinvention—but it's legible on the page and the accumulative lens holds. One meaningful deepening (meteorite integration) tightens the stakes, satisfying scope.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain hazy: the terrace's spatial relation to the valley, the timeline since "Before," and Elara's current goal emerge piecemeal past the 120-word gate without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure (−0.4). The closure unit—Elara stepping into light and "unfolding"—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual and off-page (she becomes structure like her father); no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing is legible. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (grain patterns, weather code, threshold imagery) but the final image does not reweight prior material through a visible price; instead it restates the abstract premise. The logbook's child-scrawl twist introduces a time-loop mechanic in the final third without prior setup, breaking earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the astrologer drifts through chambers, encounters fireflies, and ascends with "wonder intact." The firefly sequence offers a micro-turn, but the closure—ascending with the feather "no longer an ending"—reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a visible or felt cost that forecloses a path. The conceptual repricing is signaled but not earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a quest structure (discover why paths disappear via seeds), then shifts to a thematic reconfiguration at the crater glass. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: paths weren't lost but "given away…as gift," reweighting the premise. However, cost is oblique—no on-page action or option is foreclosed by this realization; she simply "carries" the insight and scatters conjectures. The cadence shift and lyric reprise of "before memory fades" charge the ending, but the felt price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a decisive on-page closure unit. The ending returns to the opening frame—Elias sitting beside the bishop, stars overhead—without reweighting stakes or introducing felt cost. The vignettes (barista, runaway, physicist) are additive rather than escalatory; each transforms independently without cumulative pressure that narrows Elias's options. The Orientation Test is waived (anchors arrive early), but the absence of a legible before/after change or conceptual repricing at closure prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a lyric pattern—dance as inscription, memory as rebellion—and the moonstone speck provides a concrete turn that deepens the dominant stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the villagers' arrival reweights her exile from solitary to communal), but the cost remains largely asserted rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words in; the "nostalgia ban" and "court choreographer" are introduced late), triggering a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The ending image of teaching the child reconfigures her stance, but the price—what she forfeits by returning to community—is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—dawn ritual → stone drop → prism removal → departure—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the glazier's state at the end is indistinguishable from the beginning. Closure requires a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with cost; here the final image ("compass points") restates the premise without reweighting it or foreclosing any option. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence shows a felt or conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates through reflection, celestial witness, and the ritual of reading letters, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the box becomes lighter; he leaves his own letter as Charged Poise). Orientation is clear by the opening lines. However, the closure's cost is asserted ("lighter now, as if its fractures had let some of the burden breathe") rather than made undeniable through a concrete on-page choice or forfeiture—removing the conceptual claim would leave the walk and the letter-leaving intact, suggesting the reweighting is decorative. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and holds it, but the final image does not crystallize a visible trade-off or foreclose a path with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pattern creation and trial-balloon launches build toward the obsidian disc's arrival and resonance cascade. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the multiverse exhales, timelines realign) but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—adjacent-stream improvements are told, not shown to foreclose a live option for the dreamer herself. The orientation anchor (grotto, tide-polished, moonlight) lands early enough. One meaningful deepening occurs (silver balloon returns with solution, then emerald balloon triggers cascade), sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cartographer moves through discovery, reads fragments, sketches echoes, and departs with reweighted purpose. Orientation anchors (ivy-veiled passage, post-climate-shift world, her role) arrive early. The closure—her recognition that "legacy's burden was not meant to be carried alone"—lands as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her mission from solitary mapping to an act of transmission. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she leaves her work behind, but the forfeiture feels more ritual than renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diaries reframe her task, satisfying the Accumulative requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" remains "the elusive mirage painter" without grounding identity, and the terrace location lacks spatial anchors beyond "marble tiles" and "prism parapet" until well past 120 words (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density of image, pattern of mirrors revealing possibilities), but no meaningful tightening or cost appears—mirrors "shiver" and "crack" without resistance, and the painter simply withdraws her hand and leaves. The ending offers no legible before/after in her stance or situation; she was already complete, she remains complete. Closure form is absent: no Decisive Change, no Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, no Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (terrace, midsummer, triple moons, Elira alone). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered ritual preparation (clipboard, ink, pen, writing clauses) culminating in soldiers arriving and signing. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—peace is "mustered" via ceremony, and the final image ("not because peace had come, but because...it had been mustered") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost (decades of failure, "the courage to return"). The cost is felt in her history and the smudged thumbprints, though the physical act of signing is done by others, slightly externalizing agency. One meaningful deepening is present; escalation coheres under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and sustains a single POV across one continuous scene. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation/release) with visible cost: Elias leaves the egg, relinquishes possession, and returns to his destructive work, the choice foreclosing retrieval. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered backstory, the map ritual, and the resonance event, then shifts cadence in the final departure to reweight the atonement gesture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ground trembles and the echo rises, reweighting his silent crusade. The cost is legible: he gives the artifact away and accepts that tomorrow he remains "ruthless." Minor penalty: the map's mechanics and the glowing cracks feel late-introduced and their causal link to the egg's placement is asserted rather than prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: threads untangle in sequence, echoes spill out. Closure effect is a Conceptual Repricing—the prism empties, the courtesan becomes "keeper of the unraveled"—but the cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; no tactical shift or forfeited option appears in the final beats. The transition from opening courtyard to prism work is smooth, but the "harvest of echoes" remains metaphorical noise rather than stakes that narrow choice. Orientation is clear early; one meaningful deepening (thread resistance → knot dissolves) occurs but without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear: who, where, and when anchor early. The story follows a single-POV reflective mode; the dominant stake (ethical accountability via storytelling) is signaled and the protagonist's decision to return to Mira with a new show provides a Charged Poise moment where options crystallize. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the protagonist's smile and earned serenity read as resolution without demonstrated sacrifice or foreclosed path. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; instead it summarizes his transformation. The structure is reflective-led with ~40% backstory, which anchors to the present stick but doesn't generate on-page micro-choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (moth wing, monarchs, moss-thread) toward a final density shift. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the structure dissolves as intended, and the monarch lifts with "the weight of a history briefly, blindingly, remembered"—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized on the page. Orientation is clear early (grotto, clouds, alone). One meaningful deepening occurs when she ties the final knot and the monarch alights, reweighting the ritual's solitude into a shared benediction, but the price (dissolution by morning) is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered ritual description toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where the helix becomes a vessel for collective memory. The closure moment—"I step into the light, technically gentle hands empty now, heart full of names"—offers a clear before/after with conceptual cost (surrender of signature, transition from sculptor to medium). Orientation is delayed; who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the opening third, and the causal chain reads elliptical rather than because/therefore. The meaningful deepening occurs, but the cost feels asserted more than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: storm approach, dream descent, symbolic vision, and final emergence accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara "becomes the road." However, the closure unit lacks legible cost—she walks out unsoaked, saluted by trees, with the bunker collapsing conveniently behind her. The final image asserts transcendence but does not dramatize a forfeiture, refusal, or price paid on the page. The orientation penalty is waived (anchors present early), but cost proof at closure is absent, triggering the −0.6 deduction specified in the Cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (astronomer), where (ziggurat terrace/Sky Chamber), and when (between regimes, Sirius's descent) within the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual preparation, schematic layering, and the tile's hum, culminating in the log entry and re-wrapping. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he will return tomorrow with fresh chalk—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral on the page; the piece asserts sacrifice in backstory without a present forfeiture that narrows options. The final image reweights prior material but the pressure feels more asserted than dramatized in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the "scheming pacifist" label and "soundless sanctuary" are named early, but no concrete spatial or temporal grounding emerges until well past 120 words; the "while reality shifts" frame remains abstract throughout. The closure unit—humming melody internalized, box left on moss—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("Its purpose had shifted") rather than shown through a forfeited path or altered tactic. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode (density increase, pattern break) but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the "ghost of a chime" and walk into mist feel more like thematic echo than closure with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (mirror maker, ruined orchard, fog-bound twilight) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (sextant fragments, frost glow, apple blossoms) and the cadence shifts at the dream's descent, reweighting the dominant stake with a final capture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mirror maker completes her craft, boundaries dissolve, and the fog thickens again, crystallizing her mastery with felt cost (finality: "no dream would dare flee from her again"). One persistent flaw: the dream's arrival and capture feel coincidental rather than motivated by the protagonist's earlier micro-choices, weakening causal texture even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors early (quartz-eye mender, cathedral orchard, post-Guild-expulsion). The accumulative lens holds: vow-gathering intensifies through the ribbon-stitching beat, and the green fabric arrival offers a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the mender's solitary labor. Cost is visible in her solitary vigil and the daughter's hesitant, incomplete return. The daughter's footprints and fabric, however, arrive without prior causal setup—coincidence complicates but nearly resolves, blurring the line and preventing full 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (curator, astral orchard, asteroid) land by ~80 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (blossoms → scrolls → bathroom glyph → petals with names), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where "nonlinear inheritance" shifts from archival puzzle to lived resonance across possibilities. The cost is conceptual but legible: she becomes "someone she no longer recognized" in one remembered outcome. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cameo splits and she touches the petal, reweighting her understanding. Closure lands on the page with felt cost in the line "remembered succeeding and becoming someone she no longer recognized."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure where the lexicon's lesson reweights the rescue premise, but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late, past the 120-word mark, with "after the time traveler arrived" and the mountain bookstore clarified only through accumulation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, taught through layered imagery, but the final reconfiguration lacks a felt price that alters Elira or Kael's options in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the protagonist descends through layered spaces (prow → belly → engine room → garden) as memories and identity fragments accumulate toward a final reconfiguration. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she takes the name *Lirien* into her palm and the ship "trembles...from recognition," reweighting her dual nature with the line "trapped freedom...was still freedom—if you chose the bars." The cost is legible (she becomes "lighter yet heavier") and the emerald card's spent state signals irreversible passage. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the floor splits and she descends into the garden, narrowing her options to confrontation with the lost self. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean early (who, where, why by the second paragraph). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the door dissolves, the clock chimes true—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the archivist gathers fragments, reconfigures the rope, and the room settles into harmony. However, the "door that shouldn't exist" resolves too neatly; it vanishes "because it was no longer needed," which is asserted convenience rather than dramatized consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (the rope responds, the pendulum swings true), but the stakes never narrow—she succeeds without impediment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orientation is clear by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the hush blooms radially, spreading through ice and beings in a density increase that reweights the storm. However, the closure image—Ripple-mark turning "toward the next cavern"—offers continuation rather than a decisive change or meaningful repricing; no visible cost forecloses a path. The echo stone's release to the largest being is the story's strongest closure candidate, but Ripple-mark's own stance does not crystallize or shift there. Under the Accumulative lens, the final cadence should reconfigure the dominant stake with felt cost; instead, it extends the pattern without a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors early (custodian, pavilion, post-collapse world) and accumulates pressure through the prism ritual until the final image reweights her role from wanderer to summoned keeper. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the beacon-tower's purpose is revealed as receiver rather than guide, and the cost is conceptual—her life reinterpreted as conduit with visible constraint (she must maintain the beacon). One meaningful deepening occurs when star-pulse strikes and memories unspool, tightening the stake from abstract proof to lived convergence. The causal chain (seven winters mapping → alignment → vision → realization) holds, though the final leap to "summoned" feels asserted more than earned through prior dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough. However, no meaningful closure unit is legible—the archivist ascends, measures shadows, writes conjectures, and descends without on-page decisive change, renunciation with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material. The "preemptive nostalgia" motif recurs but does not shift meaning or options. The piece reads as a single atmospheric tableau rather than a pressure sequence with before/after stakes, violating the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens: Lira walks, decodes tiles, performs a sequence, and achieves a star-lighting climax. Orientation is present early (blooming fortress, dusk, wandering designer), and the mosaic cipher provides a clear goal. However, the closure—star flickers, holds, fortress seals—lands as spectacle without a visible cost that forecloses a path. The kerosene knot dissolves "into pigment, scent becoming song," but what option did Lira sacrifice or what stance crystallized? The cost remains conceptual and unanchored, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration claim.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: the chronicler seeks understanding through observation, and the companion's arrival intensifies the pause. Orientation is solid (grotto, starlight, tidal pools by ~100 words). The closure—"simply letting transition be what it was"—reads as Charged Poise, with the cost felt in the deferral itself ("You don't have to decide tonight" / "The tide turned"). The final image reweights prior material, but the turn is more lyric deepening than causal tightening; the companion's shift from argument to shared pause lacks a concrete on-page moment that narrows options or raises stakes. Situational pressure coheres, and the ending reconfigures meaning with felt cost, landing the closure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. The piece signals its mode early (silence as texture to be tasted) and closure reconfigures the child's relationship to silence with a final image of "thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid." However, the gravity-inversion mechanism arrives without prior constraint—tools float, the child runs upward—making it feel like a provided escape rather than a turn earned by the child's prior choices. Cost is implied in the line "They would not return unchanged," but the on-page action (falling through a fold, landing softly) avoids visible forfeiture or irreversible loss that the earlier dread promised.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through storm-glass swirls (gold ripples, syrup thickness, gray fog, silver eddies, clear mountain air, golden pulse) that track emotional barometric pressure across two passengers within one continuous terrace drift. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the operator re-clips the vial, turns the craft, lifts the glass for the next passenger with "not in warning, but in welcome," crystallizing his enduring role with felt cost (perpetual readiness, no destination for himself). Cost is conceptual but legible: he ferries others to clarity while remaining in transit.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbolic imagery (bioluminescent fruit, nano-filament ivy, solidified memory steps) toward a Conceptual Repricing at the throne—"the throne didn't grant power—it granted perspective." Orientation anchors arrive late (~160 words before "lore keeper" and clear goal emerge). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she chooses comprehension over possession), but cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture of a live option, and the ruby flake's spent state is told, not shown to foreclose a path. The "orchard collapsed into pixels" line gestures at consequence but the protagonist emerges unscathed "before sunrise," undercutting the declared temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece does not teach a coherent pattern by the midpoint; instead it layers metaphors without a stable organizing principle. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) remain vague past 120 words: "tender shadow keeper" is a title, not a name; "ashen charcoal sanctuary" is metaphorical rather than spatial. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted through abstraction ("the lesson is complete") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or altered option on the page. No meaningful tightening narrows options or changes knowledge under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "who" (Elara, pyramid survivor) quickly, but "where" (repurposed subway tunnel farm) and "when" arrive late, past the ~120-word anchor window. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through glitchy texts, the bolt's warming, and the seam's crystallization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lattice of "resolved tension" and the final text exchange reweight her stance from survivor to active tender of thresholds. Cost is felt but oblique—she gains rather than loses, and no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sensory memory, standing-wave method, cylinder as charged object). The closure—walking toward the clocktower—lands as Charged Poise: options crystallize, the mission inverts, and the cost (leaving behind her "ender" identity) is felt. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract; no on-page forfeiture of a concrete resource or relationship makes the price undeniable in a single image. The gramophone "spinning of its own accord" introduces a late rule (autonomous mechanism) not cued earlier, weakening causal grounding at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors are present by the opening lines (knight, greenhouse, night). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery and the final pirouette-and-threads sequence reweights the premise. However, the closure—threads descend, knight laughs, walks transformed—lands as assertion rather than dramatized cost; we cannot point to a specific forfeited path or visible price paid on the page. The "murmured allegiance fulfilled" is told, not shown through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through artifact discoveries that reweight the archivist's understanding of her work. Orientation anchors clearly (file room, three years post-emancipation). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she transforms her mission from cataloging loss to magnifying kindness) with conceptual cost visible in the line "she healed by magnifying small kindnesses" and the recurring button-as-compass image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button unlocks Corporal Vance's story, reweighting all prior artifacts. However, the cost remains largely conceptual/emotional rather than a felt forfeiture, and the supervisor's easy acquiescence ("he didn't object") softens what could have been sharper institutional resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors by the lagoon opening; the piece follows a single-POV causal track (key → lagoon clue → hatch → Archive Engine → broadcast). The closure is a Decisive Change: counter-narratives pulse into the regime's infrastructure, altering the information landscape. Cost is conceptual and social (regime will hunt her, indifference cracks) but the vanishing-act ending diffuses felt stakes—she escapes cleanly, leaving only a calling card. One meaningful tightening occurs when sirens wail and she chooses to stay and watch the broadcast rather than flee immediately, but the escape itself arrives unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered sensory intensification (fog thickens, dewdrops form faster, prism flickers) that deepens until the prism shatters and the prophecy dissolves. Orientation anchors quickly (grotto, saxophonist, mist). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the prophecy unravels, leaving only "the memory of light") with conceptual cost legible in the final dewdrop image and the mandate that "some silences...must never be broken again." One meaningful deepening through the melody's pressure on the grotto suffices at this length, and the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within acceptable range, but the inferred lens remains ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal seed-to-revelation without teaching a stable pattern. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (transformed always), but cost is asserted rather than shown: Elira "still sorts seeds" with no visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. The grandmother's emergence and knowledge-flood bypass prior causality, functioning as exposition rather than earned turn. Multiple story-lengths (decades of folklore, traveler influx, monument evolution) compress the 600–800 word window without legible transitions or a coherent pressure arc to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern accumulation (third pigeon, fifth customer, seventh kettle) teaches the mode early, and the closure reconfigures Elias's purpose through the underground journey and final image of leading others through the greenhouse. Orientation anchors are present (workshop beneath iron bridge, autumn, his trade). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias returns transformed, reopens with a new purpose, and the final image charges the premise. Cost is implied but somewhat abstract: he tosses his father's watch, yet the forfeiture doesn't tangibly constrain later action on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (descent, journal discovery, return), satisfying the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coin-breaking ceremony accumulates symbolic density through steam, names, and kintsugi imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shattered coin as Charged Poise—Elara's acceptance of fracture with visible cost). Causality holds within the single-scene window, and the final image reweights prior material. The closure cost is felt but slightly abstract; the "weights lifted—not gone, but transformed" moment would gain sharpness with a single concrete forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered confessions and the harp's realignment constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gorge's dissonance softens, ghosts integrate). Cost is signaled but abstract—"luminous ache," edges "blurring into stone"—without a concrete on-page forfeiture that narrows her next choice. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (gorge, sunrise, her task), and the lens holds, but the closure image reweights atmosphere more than it forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; when is signaled ("anesthesia wore off") but remains static throughout. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the forest responds to trauma, violet ripples spread, paths open, symbols coalesce. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the mathematics of mercy is "not to be calculated, but lived"—but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a legible forfeiture or reweighted choice on the page. The strap's dissolution into light is a symbolic gesture, not a price that alters later options. One meaningful deepening occurs (the forest's response intensifies toward the clearing), but the final image lacks the sharp before/after cost required for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accrues details (market, memory-trade, lens fragment, triptych reveal) toward a final image where the historian recognizes ancestors. Orientation anchors are present early (market, translator role, quest object). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the historian's recognition reweights grief into continuity), but cost remains ambiguous: the translator pays a memory to Mara, yet this transaction feels ornamental rather than foreclosing a live option for the protagonist. The ending's conceptual repricing ("truth isn't shouted") tilts toward theme statement instead of an image that demonstrates cost on the page, weakening closure legibility under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, ceiling artifacts, and the ghost silhouette build density toward a final witnessing. Orientation anchors early (who/where/when clear by the opening). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he documents, releases the ghost, and accepts his role as witness—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "lighter now" tells us the effect without showing a foreclosed option or visible price paid by the protagonist. The final image ("keeping vigil," "witness it had been waiting for") reconfigures meaning, yet the protagonist's stance was unchanged from the opening, reducing the felt weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes who (operator), where (glass orchard library), and when (after reality becomes negotiable) within the opening paragraph. The escalation—frost pattern signals urgency, she uncorks the whisper, rupture occurs, she seizes a compressed moment—follows a clear sequence, but the causal linkage is thin: no prior obstacle or cost prevents her from acting, and the "expected" destabilization undercuts genuine reversal. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the library is "beautifully broken," chaos as midwife to meaning), but the cost is asserted ("perfection was ruined") rather than shown through a forfeited option or changed relationship. The ending promises repetition ("Another rupture. Another eternity to compress") without visible consequence that alters her stance or capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through discovered glyphs, the superstition-turned-method of covering mirrors, and the collaborative transcription, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts that the real rebellion is "against forgetting"). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, baroque asteroid salon, post-visible-time epoch). The closure lands with felt cost ("alive, not in triumph, but in translation"), and the haiku reprise reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening is present, though Voss's unannounced arrival and immediate validation feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered metaphors (resonance chamber, covenant of rust, dancer's reformation) toward a final image where reclaimed light repels shadows. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the song doesn't stop, seeps into walls/bones) with felt cost (he carries the tune's weight always). However, orientation debt is present—"who" is established early but "where" (vaulted attic) and "when" (tonight/midnight approaching) require assembly across dispersed lines past the 120-word mark, and the causal chain between singing → chip glowing → dancer reforming → shadows defeated compresses multiple metaphysical moves without clear mechanics, risking opacity even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elira descends, performs psychometry, reads the journal, and walks deeper—each beat layering scent, silence, and mineral memory to reweight her understanding of belonging. Orientation anchors (factory, fissure, lagoon, passage) arrive promptly and the closure image ("the stone sighed around her, sealing the way behind") offers Charged Poise with undeniable cost—she cannot return. However, the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page; the final image asserts alignment rather than dramatizing the friction of surrender, and the psychometry revelation arrives as exposition ("hinged awakenings began") rather than a causal turn that narrows options mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the GPS failure, archway setting, slide viewing, and carving beats layer toward a final image of communal lantern-lighting. However, the closure unit (villagers holding hands at the archway) occurs largely in summary ("Days later… people didn't panic"). The cost—Elara's shift from solitary artist to community teacher—is told rather than shown in a final beat where options narrow. The ending lands thematically but lacks a discrete on-page moment where a visible price is paid or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the journey gathers density (postcards → cathedral → discovery → mural → garden) and the final cadence shift ("The world sleeps. She stays awake. The flowers bloom.") reweights the opening mystery with conceptual cost—her perpetual vigil. Orientation anchors early (artist, pavilion, autumn). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses ongoing observation over solving, forecloses explanation, and accepts the cost of nocturnal solitude. Minor weakness: the cost is felt but not dramatized in a concrete choice that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery around lagoon/debris/diary accumulates toward the final wading scene. Orientation anchors arrive (zeppelin, lagoon, archivist) but remain abstract; "floating library," "obsidian lagoon," "saltbox beneath dunes" function as lyric gestures more than grounded space. The closure image—archivist waist-deep, arms outstretched, humming—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted in elevated language ("unbearable, searing reverie") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (arranging debris → lagoon glow → becoming archive), sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the final cost remains conceptual and diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and motifs (lanterns, amber bottle, discarded objects) toward a conceptual repricing of "revival" as collective becoming rather than restoration. Orientation is clear early. The closure—lanterns emerging from collective memory, the bottle now "belonging to the becoming"—offers a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. No pointed sentence makes the price of this transformation legible; the accumulation teaches a pattern but doesn't impose visible sacrifice or tradeoff, keeping this below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard hums, petals fall, memory spills into air, building density toward the release of emotional spores. Orientation anchors (Elira, rooftop garden, post-foghorn dawn) land early. The closure—releasing petals to reintroduce archived feeling into the city—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting her role from passive archivist to active cultivator. Cost is present but oblique: the city's forgetting accelerates even as she seeds empathy, and she commits to an indefinite cycle ("She would keep archiving. She would keep speaking."). The prophecy mechanism and the orchard's responsiveness are taught, but the causal link between child-Elira's words and the garden's dormancy feels asserted rather than explored, creating minor motivational drift.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (eggshell, acorn cap, weeping ice, sapling) and a cadence shift at closure reweights the stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the atrium transforms, vines uncurl, sapling appears) with conceptual cost legible in the line "The vortex inheritance wasn't a burden passed down; it was a door held open by those who dared to decrease entropy with tenderness." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The main friction is that the acorn-cap insertion and the resulting thaw occur without visible resistance or tactical adjustment—Elara's reverent act succeeds on first attempt, which softens escalation under any lens and keeps this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (trust restored, villagers listen rather than panic) with conceptual cost legible in the 17-year gap and the tester's patient ritual. However, the causal chain is more textural than because/therefore—sensors trigger the bell, but the protagonist's agency at the peak moment is passive observation rather than active decision, weakening the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (janitor, tracking station, Andromeda Drift) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the comet's arrival and dissolution deepen the established pattern of "flourishing stillness" rather than creating a causal reversal. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the janitor's recognition and return to sweeping), but the cost remains largely emotional rather than visibly foreclosing a path or altering tactics. The rogue comet's unlogged bloom charges the ending image, yet no on-page decision or renunciation creates a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (the recluse) and where (abandoned oasis) by the second paragraph, though when remains vague ("after ghosts become visible" sets a threshold but not a ticking clock). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered ghost-stories and the box's charged reprise, culminating in the beekeeper's grateful gaze and the honey-gold glyph image. However, the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the beekeeper turns, gratitude is acknowledged, light refracts meaning) whose cost remains oblique—no explicit path is foreclosed, no tactical option visibly narrows. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) is waived because the disorientation serves the timeless, ritualized atmosphere that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues sensory imprints and symbolic fragments toward a final reconfiguration where Vey's heart beats steadily and their role shifts from measuring to curating. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fused urn, the steady heartbeat, the new listings) with conceptual cost visible in the renunciation of counting seconds. Orientation anchors (emerald silo, Vey, salt flats) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragments fuse and the translucent moments appear, reweighting the capsule's function and Vey's understanding. Causality is loose—Lira's arrival and the letter's instructions feel coincidental rather than motivated—but under the Accumulative lens this is permissible as complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density accrues through layered imagery (lagoon, feather, kite) and the final image—boy running with patched kite—reweights the opening stake (beauty in the incomplete) with visible cost (the original kite is sacrificed, the new one is "crooked" but alive). The causal chain is modest but legible: kite breaks → Elira intervenes → she reframes loss through woven reconstruction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the feather is gifted and the boy's grief shifts to curiosity, altering his stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dawn labor → sparrow rescue → spiral stair completion → death as closure image. The final moment (Arlen tying the diary to the branch, lying down, dying) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he completes his monument and accepts death), and the cost is visible—his life ends. However, the Orientation Test is barely satisfied (barefoot in orchard, diagnosed six months ago) by ~120 words, and the piece never tightens options or forces a trade-off; Arlen's work proceeds without obstacle or escalation. The closure unit lands but feels inevitable from paragraph one, lacking a meaningful deepening or pressure point that narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when) in the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through layered imagery (fly amber, footprints, tower ascent) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration: she becomes part of the reaction rather than its observer, leaving the amber as coordinate. Cost is conceptual and felt—she abandons the quest for quantifiable data and accepts emergence—but the final image makes this reweighting legible. One tightening occurs when the spectrometer registers nothing and she shifts from hypothesis to lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the coachman arrives, performs a ritual planting at three sites tied to war dead, then departs with a promise to return. Orientation anchors who and where adequately by the second paragraph, though "blooming jetty" and "gloom-hill" remain atmospheric rather than spatially legible. The closure—"some journeys are measured not in miles, but in sprouts"—offers conceptual repricing but lacks on-page cost; the coachman's options and stance are unchanged, and no visible price is paid or path foreclosed. The ritual structure coheres but does not tighten or deepen meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The piece accumulates density through cylinder discoveries and voice resurrections, then offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final paragraphs: Bracken's role shifts from hunter to keeper, the settlement from salvage to resonance. However, the closure beat ("the lost were no longer gone—only waiting to be heard") is stated rather than shown through a final dramatized act with visible cost, weakening the RR's felt price. The escalation is a steady deepening rather than a narrow tightening, which fits the lens but leaves the ending more declarative than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through recurring images (compass, sketching, stars) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the violet filament vanishes after being witnessed—a Charged Poise moment where her act of attention reweights meaning. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The cost is conceptual and felt: her isolation and the peaceful absorption of the anomaly register as stakes resolved. One weakness: the turn from sketching Orion to the violet filament is a deepening rather than a tightening of options, and the final vanishing feels more like affirmation than foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and offers a closure image (sky mending, pieces moving) that reads as Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens. However, cost remains abstract: the world "stirs awake" but no specific price or foreclosed path is made visible on the page. The swap itself encounters no resistance, and the sundial map's instruction ("SWAP THE PIECES") provides an external directive rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Closure reconfigures the premise but the felt cost required for high-band entry is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The interregnum frame is signaled early and the piece accumulates gestures (baker weighing flour, child bowing, widow unbinding) toward a final image where the protagonist spells "listen" before the new sovereign. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sovereign trembles under the penumbra's gaze, options crystallize, but the cost remains conceptual and felt rather than concretely paid on the page—"the terror of being truly seen" does not visibly foreclose a path or alter tactics. One meaningful deepening is present but the price is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and motif recurrence rather than causal turns. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (arrival/sanctuary), but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or trade-off. The stone cracks and the room appears; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it delivers rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early (frozen village, platinum labyrinth, compressed silence) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the mirror dissolves into acceptance, tapestries reknit, and the village exhales. Causality is clear—her decoding work releases the woven hush—and the cost (exile remains irrelevant, not revoked) is legible on the page. Orientation anchors are present by the second paragraph. One weakness: the labyrinth's mechanics (how winnowing frayed threads unlocks time) remain abstract, relying on metaphor over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the artist refuses singularity, holds her fragmented truths aloft, and the spire dissolves—acknowledgment without absolution. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early through the canyon-echo mechanic and paid off when her own refracted apology becomes the ritual's answer. Orientation anchors (bone tower, canyon, ritual countdown) appear promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from strangers' regrets to her own. Cost is legible: the elders expected a unified parable; she offers fracture and the spire's dissolution confirms the price of that defiance. Causality holds under the accumulative lens, though the mechanics of why the spire dissolves remain atmospheric rather than rule-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through thickening fumes and sinking workshop while the alchemist completes her lacquer ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the workshop shifts from "raft on oblivion" to "altar"), but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized—she neither loses nor renounces anything concrete on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece commits to its accumulative design and the final image reweights the opening stakes, but the lack of visible trade-off (she completes the work and survives) softens the closure's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with a Charged Poise final image): she renounces the need for the mirror and the painted shell, crystallizing her stance that "reflection wasn't in glass, but in motion." The piece establishes Accumulative/Textural pressure through image accretion (mirror, shell, cave painting, tides) and a cadence shift at the end reweights the promise with conceptual cost (leaving the shell behind). Orientation anchors emerge clearly by the second paragraph; the lens holds through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a single-POV continuous scene with clear orientation (cobalt lighthouse, dawn, post-heat wave) and a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's whispered thanks and the wind's reply crystallize her stance with felt cost—exhaustion, kneeling, the empty vial as proof. However, the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than a decisive tightening that narrows options; the ships' course corrections feel inevitable rather than won through visible friction. Cost is present but diffuse across the ending rather than concentrated in a single image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who she is, her goal, and the operational logic of the cryptic calls remain abstract well past 120 words, triggering the −0.5 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The piece reads as accumulative/textural but never tightens—beats recycle the same actions (rubbing the censer, whispering coordinates, waiting for flickers) without a turn or deepening that changes options or knowledge. No legible closure: the final singing and flicker-answer repeat prior material without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing. The "reverse migration" premise is theme-stated but never forces a tactical choice or alters her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (orchard, mycelium, glass eye, survivors) and a cadence shift at the ending where she releases the relic and walks on, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—she chooses trust over control, foreclosing the path of carrying safety as possession). Cost is legible: "her silence no longer armor but invitation" and the act of leaving the eye behind. The motivational through-line from self-protection to communal trust is causally earned by the survivors' acceptance and the child's laugh, though the reflective density in the middle third slightly softens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of sensory fragments and memory-residue that accumulates toward the final pinning gesture and lantern lighting. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (opal dock, Silas, three nights prior). One meaningful deepening occurs when Silas experiences the shard-memory on night four, reweighting the boutonnière from mystery to signature. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Silas chooses not to report, accepting witnessed isolation as the cost; the lens holds. The cost is conceptual and felt but could be more viscerally legible on the page—"Some truths belong to the sea" verges on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation arrives clearly (Elias, his shop, midsummer afternoon), but the closure—discovering his sister alive via a letter dated three days hence—lands without visible cost or causality earned by prior beats. The doorway grants wish-fulfillment; no on-page choice forecloses a path or reweights options. The matrix chip's mechanics (fusing to skin, generating coordinates) emerge as late rule changes that solve problems they did not help create. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the because/therefore chain of chip → ants → cavern → arch), the ending delivers Decisive Change in circumstance but not in agency or price—he receives rather than chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the timeframe remains vague ("after twilight," "dusk curling") without a legible clock that tightens tactics. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the queen accepts starlight and commits to witness/vessel), but cost is implied through metaphor ("Let the starlight bleed through your words") rather than a concrete forfeiture or action on the page. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in its lyric density, yet the ending instruction from the figure tells rather than dramatizes the shift, weakening the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the alchemist is and what the ember nexus does remain abstract past the opening third. The closure unit—giving Elias the glowing columella and proposing a co-created "next chapter"—offers conceptual repricing but the cost is asserted ("guilt is the pigment I've been missing") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or altered tactic. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens via layered imagery, but linkage between Elias's confession and the alchemist's ritual feels illustrative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and past-self encounters toward a closure moment where the protagonist "braids the threads" and the scroll "has a shape"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. Cost is legible in the line "The grave is still there, waiting, but it's smaller now, less a verdict and more a footnote," and the renunciation of "clean endings." The orientation is present (cabin, after seeing grave, chronicler trade), but the string of past-self encounters lacks a clear tightening mechanism under the accumulative lens until the final third; the middle reads more as repetition than intensification, weakening the escalation that should reweight the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog-thinning, object-handling, and sound-mapping accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her sensory limitation as method rather than deficit. Closure lands on-page with the therapy-table placement and the vow to "map the emotional terrain," reweighting her prior "fraud" stance. Cost is felt—she surrenders the fantasy of restored smell—but the weight is mostly conceptual; no live option is dramatized and foreclosed in the ending beat. Orientation is clean and the lens holds, lifting the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase and cadence shift reweight the scars from shame to story). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—scars remain but are alchemized into rhythm and ballad—with felt cost (the scars do not vanish, only transform). Linkage is motivated by her choice to revisit superstitions and write each rune deliberately, though the final image "stories alchemize pain" edges toward direct thematic statement rather than pure image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink softens and the platform hums in resonance, but the absence of a harder-edged tradeoff or foreclosed path keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who (gossip-column exorcist), where (archive), and rough when (eve of orchard felling) within the opening paragraphs. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the scent device and manuscript layering build toward a tonal reconfiguration rather than a causal because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—two estranged figures stand in shared silence, the orchard waiting—with felt relational cost. The cost is legible in "two broken things…humming with the same flawed frequency," though the final beat lacks a sharper image or renunciation that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: the witness enters a library to perform spiral arbitration, and pressure accumulates through atmospheric intensification. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first third. However, the closure—"she was no longer witness. / She was the hush after"—delivers metaphysical merger without visible cost or a legible before/after in options or knowledge. The "spiral arbitration completed itself" passively, and no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization with felt price appears on the page. The resonant reconfiguration remains asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with strong spatial anchoring (fjord, granite cliffs, basalt promontory, horizon measurement station) within the first third. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: philosophical density increases through the backward count, and the final stilling of pistons at 299 offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize—"Time, for a breath, held"—with conceptual cost legible in the shepherd's stance. However, causality is thin; the whistle-blow, count, and key-turn do not narrow tactical options or create a because/therefore chain, and the ending reconfiguration lacks a visible price paid on the page beyond atmospheric suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the scrawls and lantern accrue symbolic weight, and the final image ("Begin again") seeks resonance through pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words (library, Elara, post-heart-attack). However, closure lacks on-page cost: the green-ink line reframes but does not foreclose a path or crystallize a trade-off with felt price. The father's clover and marker exchange is a micro turn, but it doesn't tighten options—it affirms connection without dramatized consequence. Escalation is textural (more scrawls, deeper interpretation) but never forces a renunciation or alters tactics in a visible way.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the operator loops her own call into the disc, crystallizing her role as both curator and subject. However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("began, quietly, to end her own") rather than legible in a decisive forfeiture or change in options. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the disc gathers voices, the tunnel hums, the method repeats until the final self-call reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a mosaic structure (operator's shift, man/librarian call, examples of wrong-number friendships, self-call) with clear transitions, but the causal linkage between beats is loose—each vignette illustrates the method without tightening pressure until the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through recurring imagery (locket, ink, jetty, covenant) and cadence rather than causal because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the archivist commits to return "tomorrow, and the next twilight" in an act of sustained witnessing that forecloses retreat, with cost legible in "gently thorough" devotion and the acceptance that regeneration is incremental ("stitch by ink-stained stitch"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (metaphor-dense reflection interleaved with sensory anchors) and sustains coherence to closure, though the accumulative deepening is gradual rather than sharply tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Elara, station, present-day setup). The accumulative lens is signaled early and holds: each story exchange adds density until the final moth-eaten coat exchange crystallizes the pattern with felt human connection. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (the station's transformation from monument to abandonment to murmured communion) with cost made visible in Elara's tears and the man's steadied hand. One meaningful deepening occurs when the moon rock ritual shifts from rumor to genuine reciprocal witness. Minor slip: the "story had changed" declaration in the final paragraphs edges toward thematic echo rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, seeking a stillpoint. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sensory imagery and musical notation toward the stillpoint encounter. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the discovery reweights grief/joy as harmonics), and the ring-placement gesture carries conceptual cost—she leaves the compass behind, trading external guidance for internal tuning. One tightening: the convergence of notes into chorus narrows her path to the glade, though the protagonist's agency in navigation versus passive following remains ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with the anomaly as medium for reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive within the opening but remain abstract; "gravitational anomaly" and "edge of spacetime" function as lyric placeholders rather than navigable geography. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (seed metaphor returns reweighted: "planted in the wrong tense"), and the final image sequence (letters unsent → conversations had) articulates conceptual cost. However, the escalation is diffuse—no single tightening moment narrows options; instead, the middle unfolds as a series of editing examples that accumulate texture without a decisive pressure point. The causal chain is loose: she traces a glyph, edits emerge, she lowers the pen—none of these steps foreclose prior paths or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit under any lens. The piece circles a conceptual premise—silence as music—without a decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The girl's arrival in the final third introduces a new receiver but no reversal or tightening of Elara's stakes. The ending asserts that "music echoed" in hearts and wind, but this is told resonance without on-page pressure or sacrifice that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who she is, where precisely she stands, and what concrete obstacle she faces remain vague past the 25% mark. The "forgotten promise" functions as abstract MacGuffin with no causal setup—she seeks it because the text declares it, not because prior scenes established its stakes. The closure—stepping into light while voices sing—offers no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing; she simply receives validation without altering options or paying a price. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applied; also cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean within the first paragraph: experimental survivor, auric lagoon, starlight, entangled memories. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through drumming, the garden responds, and the final image reweights the protagonist's stance from solo sufferer to collective weaver. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): she stops drumming, the garden carries the rhythm, and she breathes with the universe, accepting the graft with cost legible in "weary" and the permanence of the entangled chorus. The cost is felt but oblique; the line "she felt whole" risks tidiness when the prior suffering was so acute.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discoveries (coin → map → keyhole → overheard confession) toward a conceptual repricing: the "key with no apparent lock" reweights the premise from physical tool to metaphor for truth-gathering. Closure lands with Lena's deliberate non-confrontation and the map's transfer, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible in the choice to work through silence rather than direct action, forecloses spectacle. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening when the keyhole's purpose inverts from mechanical to metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the guardian's repeated light-weaving accumulates into the drowned woman's response, then the unbroken starlight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the drowned woman's gentler descent, the star piercing through) with felt cost visible in "smiled—first time since her wedding day—and sank again." Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt dock, hooded guardian, canal). One meaningful deepening: the drowned woman's touch transforms rejection into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Elira enacts a plan, and the grotto's effects accumulate across town. Orientation anchors (cobalt library, mist, Coach Elira) appear early. However, the escalation is thin—she tests the grotto once, then executes the full display without meaningful resistance or complication. The closure image (new arbors glowing, Elira walking home "cradling not an object, but a possibility") reads as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her rebellion from hidden artifact to visible network, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no visible sacrifice, no path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (Lira, dock, post-violence world) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the scrimshaw glows, the island surfaces, Lira wades deeper, and the whale's call peels back "layers"—a density increase without strict because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (she returns softer, her role shifts from hauling cargo to "mending souls"), but the final cost is asserted rather than shown: we're told "violence didn't return" and that her touch now carries the whale's echo, yet no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a live option with felt consequence. The shift feels declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of erosion and hollow compliance early, sustains it through whittling/narrating beats, and lands closure when the protagonist seals the bouquet in the box, receives certification, and returns to whittling—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where endurance forecloses authentic mourning with visible cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Compliance officers arrive and the protagonist must perform sanctioned grief, tightening the pressure between survival and authenticity, which pays off in the final image of "whittling absence into artifact."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when drift through metaphor past the 120-word threshold without concrete anchoring. The closure unit—stepping onto ice and "the world…remembered how to listen"—lacks visible cost; nothing forecloses a path or changes options on the page. The drive lens remains ambiguous (lyric accumulation or situational poise?), and no because/therefore linkage tightens stakes. The ban-lifting frame sets expectation but never tests the poet's agency against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (glassblower's courtyard, Elias, post-phoenix setting). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through plant arrangements and the courtyard's gradual awakening, culminating in Marta's mirrored action with the sunflowers. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Marta's recognition and the pact to "wake the kiln" crystallize shared stakes with undeniable pressure. The cost is conceptual and relational (Marta shifting from merchant to student, both committing to root-and-rust methods), legible in the final exchange and the courtyard's hum of agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory echoes and questions to reweight the premise of connection. The midpoint tuning-fork strike and the singing beat deepen density, and the final charged lens offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize—Elira now carries "seeds" forward. However, cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action forecloses a path or changes her tactical options. The Cost proof test fails: the closing glow in the lens is metaphorical warmth, not a legible price paid. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by ~90 words). Apply −0.8 for cost ambiguity at closure under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and what she does emerge gradually, and the "timeless observatory" remains abstract (no spatial anchors by ~120 words). The piece operates in Accumulative mode—density and resonance rather than causal linkage—but the closure lacks a decisive reweighting or visible cost; she performs her ritual as she has before, someone unfolds a crane offstage, and she continues. No on-page alteration of options or knowledge occurs. The final act (burnishing coordinates, leaving the locket) mirrors prior actions without a cadence shift or deepening that charges the ending with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within the opening paragraph ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "rain-beaded skylight loft," "after the cryptocurrency crashes"). The accumulative/textural lens is taught through layered images (cards, measuring tape, journal, maps) and a pattern of observation-cataloging-connection that builds density. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration: the visitor's line "remembering forward" reweights the cartomancer's labor, and the measuring tape's final unspooling signals Charged Poise. Cost is felt conceptually—the endless, solitary labor mapped across pinned constellations—but the ending does not foreclose a path or impose a visible trade-off, which limits the sharpness of the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern-breaking (arrhythmic song vs. nostalgia's expectation of ritual mourning) reweight the stake, and the final release of atoms constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (weeping, darkened veil, daughter still silent). One meaningful deepening occurs when the historian shifts from scholarly detachment to singing her daughter's tune, narrowing options and charging the closure image. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening and tracks a clear investigative arc: Elira hunts the shadow, discovers its metamorphosis, then embeds the stone to ripple texture back into dreams. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she accepts the shadow's adaptation and ensures roots persist—with conceptual cost legible in "luminous regret" and the acknowledgment of what was lost. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through lyric layering, the stone and shadow reprise, and the final act reweights the premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the shadow "was not a glitch...it was hope's chrysalis." Cost is felt but oblique; the exact price of her embedding the stone (what she forecloses) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early; the dominant stake—whether to stay complicit or rebuild with integrity—is signaled clearly. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the reconstruction ritual deepens pressure through layered choices (mixing pigments, drafting care plans, testifying). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the tail in the glass case and her decision to open a true sanctuary reconfigures her stance with visible cost (savings, anonymity, solitary work). The tightening is subtle but legible; cost is felt rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (scars, ivy, hourglass, coffee rings) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors who and where adequately, though "after anesthesia" remains vague on clock and consequence. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the seed dissolves into her scar, rewriting "tragedy to threshold"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized (no visible sacrifice, loss, or foreclosed option on the page). The narrative moves by accretion and lyric juxtaposition rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens, yet the final image lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price required for high-band Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (booth, rain, film strip). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discovery (film → napkin → letters) and the final image reweights "unused love" from stored to released. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the decision to mail the letters, transforming the premise from vault to motion. Cost is stated abstractly ("only carried, only set gently") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or consequence that alters her options. The marquee message and "glitch or gift" moment borders on convenient validation rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: recurring images (stardust, archway, tracing) and tonal density build toward the winter climax. Orientation is delayed—who she is, why she does this, and when "now" occurs—past the 120-word mark without a taught pattern that pays off at closure, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she "finally, truly, rested" after releasing the voices), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no visible forfeiture, no tactical shift, no legible price in the final image. The lens holds, but the closure lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (guard, dune, chess clock) and follows a single continuous mission sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dimly flickering sphere is charmed into coherence, and the chess clock's trembling second hand offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the opening stalemate image. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid by the guard himself; the "weight lightened by a single breath" is asserted, not shown through a constrained choice or loss that alters his next move.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (mechanical rainforest, mid-air awakening). The piece accumulates textural density through the forest walk and Edge sequence, building toward the gear-as-key realization and the void crossing. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the protagonist steps into the void without forfeiting anything on the page, and the "reconfiguration" of reality is asserted rather than dramatized. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and the final image charges prior motifs, but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the guides sit in vigil and the star-punches chart "inner constellations." Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (ferry guides, dusk, ridgeway). The cost is conceptual—waiting, reverence, shared burden—but legible in the final image of star-holes punched into doorframes by dawn. However, the tightening is modest: the discovery of the shoe and whistle deepens meaning but does not narrow prior options or force a tactical shift, keeping the escalation gentle rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt fortress, bellhop, piano bolt backstory). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the staircase ritual, phantom guests, and recurring silence accumulate toward the decisive act of replacing the bolt and playing middle C. Closure lands on-page—he breaks the self-imposed silence, the fortress does not collapse, and the stain flushes gold—marking a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost. The final beat reconfigures the safety/silence binary without a tidy resolution, and the cost (years of muting the fortress, the risk of structural collapse) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece signals its pattern early—cryptic messages across weeks—and the closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she declines the throne with visible cost). Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph (diminutive titan, ancient temple library, exile mission). The causal chain is legible: planted messages → converging witnesses → fountain revelation → pretender unmasked. However, the "days bled into weeks" ellipsis compresses all escalation off-page, and the final renunciation lacks a visible on-page forfeit that closes a living option; the cost is asserted ("hollow echo") rather than shown in a tactical sacrifice or relational fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments—coral skeletons, tidal logs, testimonies, journal, code—accrue density until the submersible descent crystallizes the reefs-as-dormant revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the paths "submerged" rather than vanished) that reweights the opening stake with conceptual cost visible in Elara's shift from searching to revealing. Orientation anchors quickly (station, Elara, post-ban setting by paragraph two), and the 17-second delay discovery creates a meaningful tightening. One substantive weakness: the descent and the final teaching montage compress abruptly, summarizing rather than dramatizing the ultimate encounter and its immediate aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: the stargazer's realization that rebellion is about listening, not winning, and the gathering of others crystallizes options with felt pressure. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or constraint is made legible in the final image. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density increase through sensory layering and the stone-circle hum), but the escalation relies on environmental responsiveness rather than protagonist agency, weakening closure anchoring. Orientation is clear by the opening lines; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (parchment → glyphs → vines → embryo → dissolution → seedlings) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the embryo's essence seeded into the land rather than held by one). Visible cost appears in the amber's dissolution and the grandmother's physical expenditure, and the final image reweights the opening premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vines answer her call, narrowing her path to communal rather than solitary power. Minor causality gap: the vines' sudden appearance and the embryo's cooperative dissolution feel convenient rather than earned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by ~80 words (arboretum, seaside cliff, survivor context). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated visits, sketches, and the pearl-of-stillness motif, culminating in "I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—the protagonist reweights grief as compass and continues witnessing with visible cost (the tears, the daily return, the secret gap in the fence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the freeze becomes "a frequency I'm finally tuned to receive." Cost is legible: the crumpled photograph's weight shifts, tears are counted no more, and the arboretum becomes collaborator rather than escape.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the protagonist gathers fragments, stitches parchment, and the final image (painting on eyelids, box reassembling) reweights prior material. However, closure lacks visible cost—the box reassembles "not perfectly, but functionally," walls remain "intimate with collapse," yet no specific path is foreclosed or price paid on the page. The moment she steps onto the tapestry triggers inversion and cocoon, but causality is metaphorical rather than motivated by prior choice; luck or magic resolve the transformation without her agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens: the tracker investigates a phenomenon, discovers the key (time slows for the witness), then tests it on herself. Orientation is clean by the opening lines (who, where, temporal anchor). The closure—her disappearance into "the ink's final pattern"—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the choice to step into the answer she sought. However, the cost is conceptual and abstract; the final image lacks the visceral or relational price that would make the before/after undeniable on the page, leaving the closure legible but somewhat ethereal.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: the archivist's act triggers a felt emotional contagion that reshapes the city's consciousness, foregrounding a Conceptual Repricing where confession-as-frequency supplants document-as-object. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (cryo-wax, phantom voices, frost on glass) and the final reconfiguration ("truth doesn't need volume... only a heartbeat") reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors promptly (archivist, library, frozen capital), and the sequence progresses causally from artifact placement to transmission to societal ripple. Cost is legible: her erasure from records and legendary status, the regime's scramble, the populace's limbic infection. The piece sustains its lens through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as closure: Elara's ritual of sheathing the knife and offering cuttings to strangers forecloses violence with visible cost (her father's legacy, isolation in a charred world). Orientation anchors are present early (glass dome, desert rose farm, post-tower setting). The final beat with the child reweights prior material but adds no new pressure or tightening; the story's stakes remain static from opening to close. Cost is conceptually legible but emotionally diffuse—no single moment makes the price undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density and sonic imagery building to a cadence shift when the spike cracks and releases the echo. Orientation is delayed—we learn who/where/what gradually through the first third—but the pattern teaches disorientation as texture, so waiving the penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the echo absorbed by constellations, the fisher carrying shards forward), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, weakening the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is anchored early (observatory, after the call, newsprint heiress). The piece follows a causal lens: journalist's call → her investigation → proof by contradiction → email dispatch. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (she triggers exposure, foreclosing silence). However, the decisive act (emailing the folio) arrives without on-page resistance or micro-turn that narrows options; the tension is pre-loaded rather than built through scene pressure. The cost is felt but the final image (watching smoke, waiting for callback) diffuses rather than charges the moment, reducing closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is and where she stands spatially remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—tethering the glyph to the machine—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than shown: "the firmware wept" and "static dissolved into sighs" are metaphorical claims, not dramatized consequences that alter her options. The causal lens is ambiguous: the amber insect's transformation and the letter-writing feel like parallel symbolic gestures rather than because/therefore linkage. The father's voice emerging "clear and warm" resolves the guilt without visible price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (chalk artist), where (grotto), and when (during the unlearning) by the opening lines, satisfying orientation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds toward a pattern-break when the mandala whispers synchronize, then dissolve into recognition. However, the closure unit—her standing, smiling, and later pausing at the street musician—lacks legible cost on the page; the tile flake cracks "softly" and she "didn't mourn its fracture," bypassing rather than foregrounding the price. The cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what she forfeited or what path closed. The ending gestures toward Conceptual Repricing ("meaning isn't found in the fixing of broken things, but in witnessing how they break") but delivers it as meta-commentary rather than a final image that reweights prior stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the renaming ritual accumulates density through the survivors' participation, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elira's new definition of mercy crystallizes communal purpose. Orientation anchors quickly (plaza, Elira, post-fire). The closure reconfigures the plaza's identity and Elira's relationship to her past, but the cost—what she forecloses by committing to "aberrant mercy"—remains conceptual and undramatized; we see purpose but not visible sacrifice or trade-off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ghost weaves echoes and sings, the orchard responds, and the final tree-planting image reconfigures her own dissolution into ongoing possibility. Closure is present—she releases herself by rooting others—but the cost is asserted rather than felt; "her form thinned" appears suddenly without prior dramatization of what she sacrifices or forecloses. The fractured-timeline premise remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not narrow options or create a legible turn. Orientation is clear early (hedge maze, ghost, orchard), so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: "who" (Elira), "where" (light painting studio), and "when" (after the static shock) anchor by the third paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—somatic markers accumulate, fractals recur, biofeedback patches together—and the final image (somatic glyphs, opening doors) offers a Conceptual Repricing: true communion is somatic, not chemical. Cost is conceptual but not viscerally legible on the page; no forfeited relationship, resource, or on-page vulnerability dramatizes the pivot. The FDA recall shapes backstory but doesn't narrow live options in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory mapping beats until the fossil's activation crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist shifts from solitary recorder to active participant/conduit). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (coastal cave, post-hibernation timeframe, sensory mapper role). The closure lands on the page—"her purpose no longer solitary"—with felt cost (the fossil dissolves, the solitary mission transforms). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fossil floats and she responds by modulating her own output, narrowing her stance from observer to co-creator.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with mosaic structure (warehouse work → echo speaking → jar distribution → teaching → final image). Orientation anchors arrive late—"hourglass turner," "amber warehouse beneath cliffs," and her cataloging practice emerge across the first third without early spatial grounding. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing ("prophecy was stitched in silence"), but the cost remains abstract; no specific choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page. The escalation is density-driven rather than causal, which fits the lens, but the final image recycles the opening ritual (sand falling, echoes humming) without reweighting prior stakes through a visible pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Elira climbs, plants evidence, and departs, with the final image reweighting her entire arc from burned spy to "quiet gardener of justice." Orientation is swift (who/where/when within opening lines). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): she surrenders to legacy rather than survival, foreclosing revenge with visible cost (walking away, trusting seasons she won't see). The cost is felt conceptually but could be more visceral on the page—no physical or relational price is shown in the final beat, only asserted through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the fog crossing, yarn needle, and palimpsest promise accumulate density through recurring images, and the final exchange attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (gesture of invitation/recognition). However, cost remains implied rather than legible on the page—neither character's options visibly narrow, and the needle handoff does not demonstrably foreclose a prior path. The crossing itself lacks causal pressure; the horses "step onto solid ground" without on-page obstacle or choice that tested the coachman's resolve. Orientation is clean, and the lens is inferrable, but closure lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation anchors early (potter, kiln, oasis, heat). The piece deepens pressure through layered images—thrum, bee, lantern glow—that reweight the oasis's resistance from physical to resonant. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unfired pot and glowing glass crystallize a stance where "fractures heal not by sealing, but by letting light through." Cost is oblique but legible in the choice to leave the vessel soft, porous, vulnerable. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length; the ending reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the harbor and fire escape setting, though "seventeen springs" arrives late as backstory. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the prism placements layer toward a tonal shift from "quivering hush" to "reverence," supported by the child's laughter and the gardener's smile—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize without a decisive external act. Cost is felt (grief acknowledged, mission completed, departure signaled), but the final image "leaving the prisms to their work" is more quiet exit than reweighted pressure. One meaningful deepening present; no causality breaks, but the RR effect is softer than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered memory, recurring brass instruments, and the hum motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Veyra shifts the sundial shadow "not toward extinction, but toward genesis." Closure lands as Charged Poise—she realigns the library's purpose with felt cost (her own atomic resonance channeled into brass, prior self's dissolution acknowledged). Orientation anchors (tidal library, Veyra, cloud-tides) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cloud-tide floods and she must secure Chamber Seven, forcing her from passive witness to active realignment. Cost is conceptual and felt but would be stronger if a specific path were visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors WHO and WHERE by the opening third; WHEN is gestural ("after the cloud bursts"). The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: rituals layer (twig arrival, name-writing, origami birds, water-stepping) toward a metaphorical reconfiguration. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into living installation), but cost is asserted rather than legible on the page—Aris's dissolution into light and water reads lyric but lacks visible forfeiture (relationships, autonomy, specific memories sacrificed). The "rejoin" command and subsequent transformation feel convenient rather than causally earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Elira isolates the subsonic payload, threads a counter-frequency, and the campus calms—each step narrows options and raises cost (the tricksters notice, "writhed, weakened, then retreated"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure is Charged Poise: the tricksters retreat but will return, and Elira pins new coordinates with "Try me again. I'm listening," crystallizing the ongoing stance with felt cost (sleepless vigilance, the campus "breathing" but not healed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the signal "pulsed with irritation" and she realizes "they were watching," which narrows her tactical window and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the organ melody, moving stars, and spiral key build density toward a final image of spatial liberation. Orientation anchors (nexus, five arches, starlight) arrive early. Closure form is Conceptual Repricing—space's "right to bend" reweights the premise—but the cost remains oblique: the compass clatters, the passage widens, and Elara walks out "no longer claustrophobic" without visible forfeiture or tactical constraint. The final image lacks the sharp edge of felt price required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (quarry, Elira, ribbon fragment, cold cases). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and the gallery of faceless portraits build toward the confrontation and collaborative unmasking. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (collaboration replaces accusation; empathy awakens in the town), and the cost is legible—no legal resolution, only communal mourning. One weakness: the killer's emergence from behind the crane feels coincidental rather than causally motivated by Elira's actions, blunting agency at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: Elara decodes the stanza, activates the resonance board, and the storm shifts. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the exile ends because she succeeded, not because success required a meaningful sacrifice on the page. The jet stream "settling into a gentler path" is a solution delivered without the felt price or foreclosed option that a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration requires. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final image offers reward without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, held through the ending. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the fiddler steps forward into possibility, "never" reweighted as "a space waiting to be sculpted," with the cost felt in his years of holding still. Orientation anchors (bridge-song fiddler, mountain pullout, after hitchhiker vanishes) arrive early. The piece accumulates through description and reflection rather than because/therefore linkage; one meaningful deepening occurs when the glass flake warms and shifts, reweighting the hitchhiker's fate. However, the causal chain between playing, the flake warming, and the fiddler's internal shift is associative rather than motivated, and the ending cost—permission to begin again—is conceptual and oblique rather than a visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers retrospection, symbolic objects, and reflective beats toward a final image of the lit train and dancing in the loop. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the circling path reweighted as meaningful—but cost is oblique; no single choice on the page forecloses a live option or imposes felt sacrifice. The Orientation Test is satisfied (character, abandoned circus train, and timeframe anchored early), but the five-year span compresses into summary, obscuring causal linkage between startup failure and think-tank pivot. The final image resonates thematically but lacks the on-page decisiveness or visible price that would secure higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the song and the final invitation to others, but the cost remains diffuse—emotional labor implied rather than a specific path foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The middle deepens through the telegram and the dream encounter, but the turn hinges on off-stage song mechanics rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options. The final image of pressing a fresh daylily gestures toward continuation without a decisive before/after that makes a felt price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established (druid at cursed lake after failed magic trick), and closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed's revelation process. However, the accumulative lens remains ambiguous—the expanding circles feel more metaphorical than tactical, and the causal chain from kneeling to transformation to "catching" light lacks clear because/therefore linkage. The cost is asserted ("She was no longer guarded. She was revealed") but not dramatically foregrounded in a specific forfeiture or changed option. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the closure unit remains somewhat diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density building toward ritual completion). Orientation is delayed—"root-bound visionary" and "cobalt glade" anchor location/character archetype, but "after the future arrived early" and the covenant backstory create conceptual fog through the first third without clear who/when grounding (−0.4). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ritual unseals the covenant and links witnesses, reconfiguring the dream-reality intersection. However, the cost is entirely abstract—no on-page forfeiture, no tactical price, no visible consequence that makes a before/after legible beyond mystical imagery. The final image ("letting her dream-self rise and meet the others") asserts transformation without showing what was surrendered or altered in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure effect—Kael's grip loosening and the roots weaving destinies together—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the stakes between vengeance and grace with felt pressure. Cost is implied through the image of roots binding rather than shown through a forfeited option or irreversible choice on the page, which keeps the ending in the RR register but limits the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds density through fragments (speaker cloth, harmonica, catalog ritual) and shifts cadence at "Project Echo," landing a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Jasper's new stance crystallizes with felt cost—he abandons emotional insulation. Orientation is clean (quarry trailer, dusk walk). The cost is legible in the pocket placement and the final listening posture. One minor weakness: the "echo valley longing" meta-phrase risks over-articulating what the images already carry, nudging toward a stated theme rather than letting the final beat resonate alone.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recursive symbolic acts (reciting tablets, drawing signs, adding forgiveness) until the seed splits and tendrils emerge. Orientation anchors clearly (magnetic arbor, post-spirit departure, Elira present with seed). The closure—seedling writing a new sign, Elira bowing and leaving—delivers Earned Stasis with visible cost: she relinquishes authorship and walks away from potential monument. One meaningful deepening (forgiveness sign invented on the spot) tightens the stakes sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates lyric density and ritual steps rather than because/therefore turns. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (titan-gear librarian, tidal atrium). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her readiness to continue the ritual cycle, and the creel's pulse promises ongoing wonder. However, the cost is conceptual and atmospheric—no on-page choice visibly forecloses a path or alters her options. The ending reweights prior material through tone and image rather than a decisive change or trade-off with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening line; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the inspector becomes a conduit, the pearl dissolves, the caves glow. The escalation proceeds through the confession ritual with one meaningful deepening (each confession intensifies the glow and connection). Cost is legible: she empties herself of shame and becomes a vessel. Minor causality slip: the pearl "was gone" without clarity on whether it was consumed, dispersed, or transformed, leaving the mechanism slightly vague at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after several paragraphs of lyric description, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through graffiti discoveries and accordion play—but the closure unit (playing louder, rearranging ivy, leaving) lands as atmosphere rather than decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost. The piece teaches a pattern of ekphrastic mapping and does pay it off with the final note-less departure, yet the cost remains oblique: we don't see what path was foreclosed or what she can now do that she couldn't before. Linkage is present but the closure doesn't crystallize a before/after with felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (pass). However, the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between Accumulative/Textural (mist patterns, glyph collection) and Causal (the quest structure)—and never stabilizes. The ending claims a transformation ("She became the archive") but offers no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing; the mirror-crack and mist-fold are gestural rather than definitive. The recursion reveal is told as explanation rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly (observatory, Elira, midsummer, pre-dawn arrival). The closure unit—violin melting into seeds, Chancellor kneeling, garden sprouting—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallize, the empire's weight is transferred to roots). Cost is conceptual (empire's narrative perforated, Chancellor silenced by vines) but the physical price to Elira is absent; she steps back unscathed, which dilutes felt consequence. The causal lens holds through the middle (coffee-stain prophecy → plant telepathy → violin resonance → seeds) but the Chancellor's transformation lacks a because/therefore hinge; his reverence arrives as aesthetic tableau rather than motivated shift.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual's steps deepen until the emerald chip "holds" the scholar's threshold moment, and the protagonist envisions joining the "silent constellation"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her own future stance. However, cost is asserted rather than shown: no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page, and the scholar's consent ("He had requested this") preempts any tragic trade-off. The closure image reweights the opening slightly but lacks felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs (Elara, grotto at dawn). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she replaces the hairpin, reclaiming belonging after forgiving betrayal—a renunciation of revenge with felt cost (the weight of release, the refusal to let the wound define her soul). The single meaningful deepening (understanding contentment as a return rather than a discovery) reweights prior material under the accumulative lens. Weaknesses: much of the pressure accrues in reflection rather than scene pressure, and the final image, while resonant, could have been charged by a more visceral present-moment constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: unhooking the cloak is a physical renunciation that forecloses her old identity, and the closing vow to offer questions instead of certainty reweights her profession with visible cost. Orientation anchors (lighthouse balcony, barefoot, dawn) arrive early. The Accumulative lens holds: sensory beats (salt air, chimes, mirror shard) build pressure toward the decisive unhooking. One tightening suffices at this length. Cost is legible: she risks client loss and professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the stone-toss creates ripples that become temporal notation, and the final vow crystallizes Kael's readiness to vanish. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Kael's bow and Elira's promise to descend frame the next step with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (floating platform, Elira, Kael, starlit grotto) arrive within the first ~100 words. The cost, however, is largely deferred ("tomorrow"); the on-page price is implied through atmosphere rather than a forfeited option or visible trade-off in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when remain abstract past 120 words; "harmonic stone skimmer" and "tower of bone" are never concretely anchored in a legible present moment. No on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost occurs—the final paragraph ("would not move… let the world move around it") restates the opening stance without dramatized closure. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is never taught or paid off; the piece asserts thematic weight but delivers no tightening, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is prompt: who, where, and when are anchored by the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery and the mist-walk deepens rather than reverses in a causal chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shift from chasing grandeur to sharing imperfect charms) with visible cost: Lior leaves the keystone beneath the cloud-tree and sacrifices his quest for mastery. The cost is legible on the page and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keystone unlocks the mist-walk and the cloud-tree blooms.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist stops searching and begins "signifying," with visible cost in the shift from seeker to witness. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (lanterns, dive, ledger, signature) toward a cadence shift at "no longer searching, but signifying." Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (pier, midnight, lamplighter). One meaningful tightening occurs when he finds his own name pre-signed, reweighting all prior wandering. Cost is felt in the renunciation of active pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with its layered imagery and static-burst pattern, holding coherent pressure through the coin-handling ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she steps forward without drawing lots, crystallizing a stance that forecloses her prior surrender-to-chance path. Cost is visible—she abandons the method that has governed every choice since the collapse—but the mechanics of how the backwards prophecies work and why *this* vision triggers the shift lack on-page grounding, weakening causal motivation at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis): the reaper names terrors to distribute weight, crystallizing his new role. Orientation anchors quickly (reaper, observatory, dusk, post-discovery). The crystallization ritual deepens pressure through the naming sequence, and the final "heart-carrier" image reweights prior material. Cost is conceptual—accepting eternal witness-bearing—but the passage lacks a dramatized moment where he visibly forfeits an alternate path, keeping the cost somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes meaning through repeated motifs (dripping rates, the bell's fracture, the sea's silence) and pays off with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the fish's breach and the mage's quiet departure crystallize cosmic balance restored through patient devotion. Closure arrives with felt cost (he releases the bell, relinquishing proof of success). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the resin knits the bell and the sea stirs in response, narrowing the question from "will it work?" to "has balance shifted?"

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds density through the trail of photographs and relics, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise: Elias refuses erasure with visible cost when reassigned permanently). Orientation anchors are present early (Elias, ridgeway, Hollowmere resurfacing). The closure lands cleanly with felt cost: his defiance forecloses his original mandate and binds him to perpetual archival work. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "his task wasn't to erase memory, but to honor its shape," reweighting his role and charging the final shrine tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final reconfiguration), but the closure unit—"they danced for me. I remembered how to see"—lands as told epiphany rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material with legible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or narrowing of options; the orchard ritual proceeds without friction, obstacle, or trade-off, and the ending grants fusion without visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the Watcher chooses to continue bearing the burden, re-clips the buckle as private vow, and walks toward the next arbor—foreclosing flight with visible cost (the weight of ongoing vigilance). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated images (buckle, silence, signal) and a cadence shift at the chime moment that reweights the stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arbor trembles and she reads the silence as signal, then acts to stabilize the villages—narrowing options from panic to trust. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: "she would carry it… That was the burden." Minor gap: the causality linking the chime's ripple to village acknowledgment is slightly elliptical but remains plausible within the piece's taught world-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered contradiction and resonance rather than because/therefore turns. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, Kael, brain jar) arrive early; the custody battle and history rewrites frame the situation. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kael places palms on the jar and energy arcs, shifting the duplicate from dormant to autonomous—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the brain's refusal to inherit pain forecloses the custody contest and Kael's numbness shatters. Cost is visible in the dissolved battle and warmth's return, though the final image's conceptual repricing of identity-as-choice could be sharper. The lens holds, but the rewrite-history mechanic remains atmospheric rather than causally shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives early (tunnel, dusk, the conductor alone), and the piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: grief ritual accumulates density through repeated visits and the tunnel's acoustic feedback loop. The closure—"begins again"—functions as Earned Stasis: he commits to endless iteration with the cost of isolation and unrequited longing legible on the page. However, escalation is minimal; each visit mirrors the last without meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. The "giggle ricochets" beat offers a micro-turn but does not fundamentally alter his stance or tactics. The cost (loneliness, neighbors' judgment, the ghost never truly returns) is felt but not sharpened across the arc, resulting in a closure that reaffirms rather than reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (transmutation of dimensional homesickness into compass/lens). Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the "veil of sleep" timeframe remains soft but acceptable for lyric mode. The closure unit—offering the paw, the garden exhaling, homesickness transmuting—lands on the page with felt emotional cost (loneliness acknowledged, vulnerability accepted). One meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian places the pendant in the statue's hand and the ice "breathes" rather than melts, reweighting prior stakes. Causality is elliptical but legible under the accumulative lens; no breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through ritual layering (moonstone, bronze, blood, failed stone shard) and the crozier's transformation provides closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (the serpent head reborn, Elric becoming "the road"). Cost is conceptual—he abandons hope-as-destination—but the final image charges prior failure motifs. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by line 2). The escalation is a cadence deepening rather than a causal tightening; the reconfiguration lands cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who and where by the opening paragraph (interpreter, tower, gorge), satisfying the Orientation Test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through image layering (fragment, moon, towers) toward a final reconfiguration where the city awakens. However, the closure effect—towers singing, city broadcasting—lacks visible cost; the protagonist simply "packed her coil" and descended with no path foreclosed or trade-off legible. The accumulative pattern is present but the Resonant Reconfiguration does not land with felt consequence on the page, capping this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the first paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure unit—seven ferries converging, the deckhand whispering "Welcome home," then resuming work—qualifies as Earned Stasis under an Accumulative lens: he accepts the cycle of fraying and reknitting without pressing for permanence. However, the cost is conceptual ("permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth") rather than felt loss on the page, and the lens wobbles between causal problem-solving (tuning the radio by instinct) and accumulative mood-layering. The story teaches a mystical-technical pattern (glyphs, frequencies, hourglass resonance) but the mechanics remain decorative; the deckhand's actions feel like following a predetermined script rather than discovering under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the gallery "erupting" as the closure beat, but the escalation feels decorative rather than causally earned—walls ripple and portraits blink without narrowing options or forcing tactical shifts. The Orientation Test passes (architect, gallery, "walking" established early), but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the architect releases the thread and it "floats, then branched, then wove itself into the air" without foreclosing a path or making a felt sacrifice legible. The final corridor opening reads as reward rather than consequence, and no prior choice meaningfully tightened her options or reweighted what she could lose.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers setting, backstory, and thematic imagery toward a final classroom moment meant to crystallize purpose. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (benthic city, instructor role, post-alien world). However, no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the anchor chain link is introduced in her quarters, brought to class, and used to illustrate a pre-formed thesis without altering her stance or options. The ending restates the opening premise with added symbolic weight but no felt cost or foreclosed path—closer to thematic echo than Resonant Reconfiguration. The "by semester's end" summary skips the dramatized closure moment entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the girl moves from paralyzed waiting to walking toward the exit, and the photograph's pulse calms—visible cost is the relinquishment of her vigil. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere, rhythmic pulses, mist thinning) with a single meaningful deepening when the tracer kneels and offers the counter-pulse. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One substantive escalation when the tracer finds the girl and broadcasts the counter-pulse, though the turn feels more atmospheric than causally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the descent through the facility layers sensory detail, memory fragments (grandfather's journals, the child's drawing), and atmospheric pressure toward a resonant final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The phase-transition chamber sequence delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—figures flicker into presence, gratitude is conveyed through stillness, and the gold fleck completes its purpose by crumbling—but the cost remains largely conceptual (the fleck's depletion, the protagonist's "heart heavy with quiet triumph") rather than a visible forfeiture that alters her options or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Aris, observatory, 3:17 a.m.) land early. The ink-bloom defragmentation sequence serves as the primary tightening, reweighting the digital ghosts from chaotic to "settled" and Aris's understanding of error from obstacle to residue worth honoring. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Aris rises, the ghosts are patterned, he will return to a world that thinks him dead—a stance crystallization with felt opportunity cost (he remains legally erased). The cadence shift from static to settled charges the final image. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns accumulate (echoes, flock choreography, diamond's filtration) toward a final reconfiguration where the dead language is revived through the canyon's response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the canyon echoes her final word forward, reweighting silence into transmission—but the cost is implied rather than sharply legible on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The single meaningful deepening (diamond awakens, language emerges) fits the length, though the causal chain from flock patterns to speech feels more asserted than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive within acceptable bounds, waiver granted. The closure unit—Elara's metamorphosis and the Dancer's release—occurs on the page, but the cost is primarily metaphorical (bitterness "transmuted into gravitational giggles") rather than a legible forfeiture or stance crystallization with visible consequence. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density → pattern break → cadence shift), but the final image distributes weight across cosmic spectacle instead of tightening around one unmistakable price. The arrowhead splitting and phone shattering function as ritual set-pieces; no prior on-page choice by Elara narrows her options or forces a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density and pattern intensify as the music spreads, statues crack, and the orchard shifts from metallic to organic. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard awakens, the violinist commits to her mission), but the cost is asserted in retrospect ("its purpose spent") rather than shown as a visible forfeiture that alters her options on the page. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("The tarnished wonder... was molting") replaces scene pressure with declared meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, the storm-in-a-bottle motif, and the drone-border constraint, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the bottled storm is released as a signal of maternal promise kept. Orientation anchors (mailman, cobalt arcade, twilight) arrive early. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—the storm that could spike alarms is weaponized as mercy—and the final image reweights "broken promises" from loss to flight. One tightening occurs when the drone ascends and the storm's dual nature (threat/signal) crystallizes. However, the escalation is linear rather than deepening through reversal; the plan succeeds without meaningful friction once Marla's grid trick is explained.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, halo fragment, wind bells, and carousel details layer toward a final image of restoration. Orientation anchors (carpenter, morning mist, circus train) appear early enough. The closure—carousel turning, halo spinning—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the work crystallizes into sanctuary. Cost is conceptual (beauty left incomplete as "wound") but not viscerally dramatized; the carpenter pays no visible price on the page, only completes what was always his intent. One meaningful deepening occurs when he sets the halo and begins his silent song, but the inevitability undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she reawakens stories, patrons feel warmer pages)—but the cost is conceptual only, not felt on the page. The seven-year search and the scarf's activation create setup, but the amphitheater sequence unfolds without resistance or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (stepping through tessellation into the story-place), yet no visible price alters her tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive late and remain vague (whispering archipelago, odd-hour shifts, stilted outposts) past the 120-word mark without deliberate payoff, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.3). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the dream made tangible), but the causality leading to it is weak: the precise coral light appears conveniently on "one dawn, thinner than mist" without prior struggle to locate it, and the palette's mechanics are told rather than dramatized across beats. The evaluator infers an Accumulative/Textural lens (layering light and memory), but the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material—it delivers exactly what was promised without friction or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (cosmic imagery, lullabies, ribbon motifs), but the closure lacks legible cost: the idea is freed, the door sighs gratitude, and a future child will speak love—no price paid, no option foreclosed on the page. Orientation is vague (who, where, when remain cosmic placeholders past 120 words; −0.4), though the pattern is taught early enough to waive the Q3 cap. The final image asserts consequence ("no one would try to lock it away again") rather than dramatizing the locksmith's renunciation or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The causal lens holds: her research uncovers the greenhouse mechanism (stellar distortions → ship disappearances → memory theft), the mushroom placement triggers the pulse, and memories seep back—a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (she understands the orchard's survival need and chooses to stay). The closure crystallizes her choice with the recognizable price of feeding her remaining memories to the orchard, though the cost could be made more viscerally immediate in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: tea-leaf geometry, backward movement, and the trapped shadow accrete meaning until the cartographer's laugh signals closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where mentorship succeeds and the exile holds. Orientation anchors (archivist, library rotunda, afternoon) appear early. The cost is felt but oblique: her continued isolation and the perpetual threat of exile. One deduction: the reversible exile's mechanics (three riddle-solvers restore her) are told in backstory rather than tested on the page, weakening the stakes' immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered essence-weaving that culminates in the seed's opening—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the parapet seam seals, wonder anchors in this world). Orientation is swift (Elira, parapet, waterfall, dawn), and the lens holds through accumulation of memory-filaments into closure. However, cost is conceptual and atmospheric ("worlds sigh in relief") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical change that narrows Elira's options; the seed's success feels destined rather than hard-won, weakening the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (mask restorer), where (prism sanctuary), and what (unraveling a net) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through knot-by-knot progression, silence layering and releasing, culminating in the violent mid-scene knot and the final net's completion. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she will continue this work tomorrow, the cost visible in "joints stiff" and the inexhaustible queue of knotted grief. The sanctuary's sigh and her refusal to look back reconfigure the premise with undeniable momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers shadow-tracking across decades, building density until the final convergence where negative space becomes silhouette—a Resonant Reconfiguration (recognition) with felt cost (years of patient work, emotional release). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by paragraph three. One friction: the chapel's "reopening" via video comparison is told rather than dramatized in real-time pressure, slightly softening the escalation, but the closure image (doorway/nave/apse silhouette) reweights all prior material with undeniable pressure and cost is legible in her tears and the three-year journey.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (library, Earhart's plane, lab, cliffside) land clearly. The accumulative lens holds: each discovery (snow globe's properties, lunar perigee correlation, temperature drop at sister's name) tightens understanding until the realization that "letting go isn't collapse" reconfigures the premise. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—the globe vanishes, "Its energy, its purpose...transferred"—with felt cost (hollow and humming). The causality from discovery to understanding to release is motivated and legible, with one meaningful deepening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherent tone through to closure. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive within the opening paragraph. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the protagonist crystallizes her stance to invite others into her encoded sanctuary—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible on the page. The courtyard-to-dawn frame provides coherence, yet no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the balladeer's actions at the end mirror her earlier encoding without a visible forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ascent accumulates sensory fragments and textural density toward a thematic reweighting at the top. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance articulated through the diary's final passage and the servant's internalization), but cost remains abstract—no concrete path is foreclosed, no tactical option lost. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds spatial coherence (elevator → observation deck), yet the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a visible before/after with felt price. Orientation is clean; causality is loose but acceptable under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors meteorologist, gondola, post-string-break timeframe by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through cloud classifications that reweight the dominant stake (proving empty spaces remember), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): she memorializes Altocumulus #112 as "release," smiles with visible cost, and the final image ("watching her categorize not just clouds, but courage") reconfigures the premise with felt pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from observation to active memorialization with the acceptance that "empty spaces remember." Cost is legible in the smile that acknowledges ongoing pain and the devotion required to sustain the method. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the coin-decoding ritual and crescendos in the painted sky, then pivots on the realization ("it was not a barrier, but a lens") to achieve Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure—sitting beneath her painted heavens as the wrecking ball approaches—crystallizes Charged Poise: options have narrowed to endurance, and the cost (ephemeral art, no witnesses) is felt on the page. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (tree trunk library, demolition crews, face blindness). One meaningful deepening (the limit discovered) reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Arlen notes patterns, cross-references marginalia, tests the hopscotch, and the closure image shows the luminance controlled and the murmurations dancing "with purpose." Orientation anchors (aboard airship, morning routine) arrive early. The tightening from observation to demonstration is legible, and the final image reweights prior material. Cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt—no visible price, forfeiture, or foreclosed option appears on the page, which keeps this from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (−0.3). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increase toward a conceptual repricing—but the closure unit is weak: the locksmith leaves "empty-handed but full-hearted" without a legible on-page cost or decisive reconfiguration of her stance. The gears "embedded in the hall's ceiling" and her departure feel asserted rather than earned through prior causality or a visible forfeiture that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (Virelune, floating arches, Elira) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—reaching the nebula sanctuary—is signaled but never tested; the bell-ringing succeeds immediately with no reversal, and the nebula "shimmers into view" on cue without obstacle or price. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing attempt (the collective effort as bridge), but cost is asserted in theme language ("hope was brambled but blooming") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. Under a Causal lens, the lack of because/therefore linkage between chalk messages and community readiness, and the absence of escalation or tightening, keeps this functional but unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "hidden lighthouse" anchors place loosely, but "dusk" and "seven ages" lack grounding in a coherent present-tense frame. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) is legible—the adjuster completes his task exactly as planned with no reversal, reconfiguration, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The "final tick" and dissolving lighthouse are asserted outcomes, not earned through protagonist agency or a dramatized price. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ritual proceeds in a static arc from step one to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: the nut's blueprint enables the protagonist's guided path, the girl's presence triggers the rescue sequence, and his whistled code and moss-arrows causally lead her out. Closure is Earned Stasis—he returns to the orchard heart, sighs back at it, and assembles tomorrow's invisible path with visible cost (enduring isolation, foreclosing escape). One orientation anchor comes late (protagonist title "caretaker" clear only after "assigned this orchard"), but the delay does not obscure the dominant stake (prevent another ghost). Cost is legible in the final turn back and the reciprocal sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat (polymer chemist, braided ravine, chrysalis). The accumulative lens holds: foam observation patterns build density until the final hum and watermark image reweight grief as flow rather than wound. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—the chemist's tears become "part of the score" and she drives home changed, reaching for melodies instead of equations. The midpoint insight ("separation wasn't failure") could have been delayed slightly to tighten pressure, but the RR (loosened grief learning to flow) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repetition and density rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of seven glimmers and the open ledger reweights the premise—but the cost remains abstract ("distribute its weight") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The inferred lens holds, but the ending gesture does not tighten options or charge prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening fortress image and establishes a clear causal trajectory: follow reflections → descend → touch pillars → subsume remorse → release. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (release of stored remorse, shift from "salt and silence" to "petrichor and possibility") with felt cost ("hollowed but whole"). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered grief contacts, and the final cadence shift ("no taste at all") reweights the opening's "salt and silence." One meaningful deepening (pavilion contact sequence) suffices for this length, though the cost proof is more atmospheric than a pointed forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece presents a causal frame (Elara climbs, sings, the elevator responds, community gathers) but the central turn—the elevator's rehabilitation—happens without on-page resistance or cost; it simply complies once addressed. The Orientation Test is passed (who/where/when anchored early), but the closure lacks felt price: by dawn the problem is solved, the town will gather, and Elara descends victorious with no path foreclosed. The ending image (leaving the weight as "a promise") gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the prior stakes were never tight enough to make the reconfiguration costly or undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (mirror, canyon, memories) and metaphors toward a final stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (canyon, moon, engineer) arrive early. The closure is a Charged Poise: the engineer commits to returning and "modifying" with the mirror as talisman, reweighting her grief into curiosity. However, the cost remains largely asserted ("rewired grief") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (child's memory merges with her own thesis), satisfying the length requirement, but the stakes never narrow or force a trade-off with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a causal adventure structure: gravity inverts → thresholds open → fragment found → wall opens → Seed retrieved. Each gate unlocks the next, but escalation is mechanical rather than driven by protagonist choice or sacrifice. Closure delivers the object but no decisive change in Elira's situation or stance—she emerges planning "her next reentry" in the same role. The "Seed of Vigilance" is acquired without visible cost, reading as quest completion rather than transformation. Orientation is clear early; the causal chain holds, preventing collapse, but the ending lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence → discovery → carving → resonance restoration. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the grove "held its breath differently now—alive, expectant"), with felt cost in Silas's years of isolation and the grove's months of silence. Orientation anchors early (hedgehog, dawn, Silas, grove). One meaningful deepening occurs when the insulator's stress cracks become conduits. However, the cost at closure is more conceptual than viscerally felt; the final image asserts transformation rather than showing a foreclosed path or visible price paid in the ending beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, magnetic nexus, twilight before eclipse) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through memory, magnetic hum, and auroral imagery toward a final reconfiguration where he rises "spirit lighter" and commits to teaching others. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he chooses to carry the nexus's resonance forward rather than flee. Cost is felt ("bittersweet ache," "some truths arrive too late to save kingdoms") but remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or visible consequence alters his immediate options. The tightening—"correlate the silence" becomes "translate silence into strategy"—is conceptual rather than tactical, limiting escalation legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers descriptive detail and thematic assertions toward a final image of successful recovery. Orientation anchors who and where promptly, though "when" remains impressionistic ("Tonight, in the final stillness before fireworks ignite"). The clasp opens as the central event, but the unlock itself arrives without causal resistance—frequencies are adjusted, the clasp "trembles," then "sprang open" with minimal friction. Closure occurs on the page (vials packed, fireworks rage, Elara smiles), yet the felt cost is oblique: we're told she has recovered what mattered, but no prior option was visibly foreclosed or trade-off dramatized. The Resonant Reconfiguration relies on thematic declaration rather than a before/after shift legible through action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and the seed's long dormancy, culminating in the bloom's transformative stench. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (village shifts from discord to harmony), but the cost is diffuse and told rather than shown: "Arguments dissolved into apologies" summarizes off-page changes. The bloom itself is vividly on the page, yet Elira's final act (replanting) does not foreclose a live option or articulate a felt price—she simply continues her practice. Orientation is clear early; causality holds within the accumulative mode, but the ending lacks the sharp before/after that would elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift and concrete (orchard pilot, nebula planet, gravity inversion window). The closure—jamming the arrow into the tree and understanding resilience as memory—lands on the page with a visible act and conceptual shift. However, the causal linkage between touching the arrow and the epiphany feels compressed; the "gathering of echoes" mechanism is told more than dramatized in choice-altering pressure. The cost (renouncing the fixer role) is felt but not fully tested through a prior foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by ~100 words (port, containers, investigator, post-crash silence). The piece operates under a Situational lens with Accumulative texture: the investigator gathers data, the wind's "learning" deepens, and the final step into the wind's path crystallizes stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the investigator commits to observation-as-confrontation with undeniable pressure—but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. One meaningful deepening (from documenting to embodying the hunt) supports the length, but the ending reconfigures meaning more than it alters tactics or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory accretion and the final image reweights the opening covenant with felt cost (the hush now lives inside her, demanding daily tending). Orientation anchors are present early (ice cavern, aurora, bell ringer). However, the causal chain is thin—most beats are variations on "she strikes, ice responds beautifully"—and the closure unit, while present, lacks a decisive narrowing of options or a legible trade-off that alters tactics. The cost is more asserted ("wonder demands to be tended") than dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses witnessing over restoration, leaving the flute to become monument, with visible cost (the guardianship path foreclosed, the weave unrepaired). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the three realm-collapse case studies, then pivots at "This was her harvest" into a cadence shift where she walks away and redefines her role. Orientation anchors quickly (kneeling keeper, Thunder-echo Range, seventeen years after), and causality holds through her methodical investigation. One minor slip: the between-place mechanics (how she steps through with a single breath) are lightly sketched, but the cost and thematic repricing are undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.8)
    No clear closure unit emerges. The protagonist walks away after completing "the final type," but this act is not prepared by any on-page tightening of options or felt cost—she has been setting type and distributing pamphlets throughout, and the ending simply asserts finality without dramatizing what changed or what was lost. Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~150 words) and remain vague (no city, no calendar year, "topaz workshop" functions as mood-label rather than spatial anchor). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake at closure; the final glyph and the walk are asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (courier, ridgeway, aurora, delivery casket) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through the pendant's vibration, mentor memory, market encounter, and final release; the ending image (pendant dissolving into aurora) reweights the opening wonder-versus-routine stake and delivers Conceptual Repricing—wonder as transmission, not possession—with felt cost (she descends "empty-handed"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's "It remembers" crystallizes the courier's role shift from keeper to seeder. Minor slip: the casket delivery, introduced as urgent ("due before dawn"), vanishes with a single phrase ("handed the casket to a waiting archivist") that deflates stakes mid-resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece builds through layered images (frost, prism, car) toward a final reconfiguration. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she witnessed, will not publish, places the prism on her windowsill), but the cost is abstract—"Let them shatter their assumptions against her silence" declares rather than dramatizes forfeiture. Orientation is clear early. The frost-to-prism communion deepens understanding but doesn't narrow options with visible price; the ending reweights but the stakes never tighten with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through discovery (puzzle), transformation (loom reconfiguration), and sacrifice (weaving herself). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the message arrives; the spinner's essence persists in stars) with felt cost—her physical dissolution. The lens holds: each beat deepens the textural stakes rather than narrowing causal options. One persistent constraint (the amber bead's guidance) shapes the final weave, though the mechanics of "weaving thresholds" remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a lyric structure: Arlo descends repeatedly, the silk thins thread by thread, and the final glyph holds as closure. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraphs without clear anchoring by ~120 words, though the effect is intentional and eventually legible. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the glyph holds, the arches hum, magic returns), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page in a single image or sacrifice. The causality is poetic accretion rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens, but the final beat lacks a sharp, undeniable price that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (name at line 3, spatial grounding diffuse until "repair bay" recurs). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and sensory layering build toward the crystalline core revelation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the withheld truth reweights Elira's existence and her mother's sacrifice—but the cost remains abstract ("responsible") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The lens holds, but the final image does not demonstrate a concrete price paid or option foreclosed, keeping it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Elias maintains ritual connection against isolation, the lamp's extinction tests his commitment, and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when he rows away humming louder, his ache transformed to "luminescent" beacon. Orientation anchors quickly (skipper, coast, lighthouse). The cost—continuing despite the hollowing, the ache reframed but not erased—is felt rather than decisive action. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lamp flickers out and he responds with the glass and stone ritual, tightening his commitment. The closure effect is legible but relies heavily on lyric assertion ("luminescent, glowing softly") rather than a concrete image that makes the reconfiguration undeniable on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, when remain vague past 120 words; the "emerald lighthouse" and "storm herald" are titles without grounding detail until well into the piece. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs—she climbs, whispers, laughs, and waits in an unchanging cycle. The ending returns to the same routine without narrowing options or altering stakes. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural in intent, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: dye master, floating tea house, post-transplant timeframe established in opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through repeated observation (seven sunrises, twelve sunrises, tracking the old man) until the final fabric creation reweights the central question. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she stops trying to replicate magnetism and cultivates her own fractures, producing fabric that responds to emotion; the cost is visible in "her own breath-warmed tears" and the choice to remain watchful rather than explanatory. One causal gap: the mechanics of how observation translates to dye mastery could be tighter, but the accumulative pattern holds and the ending image charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (maintenance worker, tower, storm, sextant). The accumulative/textural lens is taught early through poetic density and holds through the forest sequence; closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the worker shifts from technician to witness-cartographer) with conceptual cost legible in the line "She wasn't fixing anything anymore. She was remembering for them." The sextant's healing and dream-projection constitute a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake. One persistent seam: the astronomer's backstory and the worker's arboreal motivation are told rather than dramatized, creating minor causality drift in the middle third that weakens (but does not break) the because/therefore chain leading to the forest walk.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation (who, where, when) arrives promptly and the allegorical frame is taught early. The closure unit—mica windows releasing hoarded light as voices rise—qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric; no on-page sentence shows the keeper or the community forfeiting a concrete option or enduring visible sacrifice. The final image reweights prior material but the lack of felt price in the ending beat caps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (Elira, library, seven winters, midnight nearing), satisfying the Orientation Test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered backstory and the paradox shelf until the midnight threshold triggers a cadence shift and Elira's act of presence—whispering her name, the shelves exhaling, receiving "The Grammar of Forgiveness"—that reconfigures her stance with felt cost (exposing herself to the returning Society). Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she moves from hiding-while-present to embodied presence, and the cost is legible in her decision to pin the invitation and read aloud. However, the closure image is somewhat diffuse—multiple symbolic gestures compete for final weight—and the mechanics of what actually changes for the Society's dawn arrival remain vague, slightly softening the closure's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (courtyard, vanished bakery memory, tea house discovery) and the piece holds a stable Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through remembered loss, present ritual, and guerrilla gardening, culminating in the hidden-spring drip and star moment. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist doesn't solve grief but reconfigures her stance—"she's remembered how to ask"—and the final star image reweights prior material with quiet absolution. Cost is felt (seasons of armor, bread untouched, seeds that may not grow) but oblique; the conceptual price of vulnerability is legible in the wheat-dress exposure and seed-gestures. One meaningful deepening occurs when seed-planting shifts from passive noticing to active defiance, tightening the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who: Elira; where: frozen library above clouds; what: measuring vows in a magic slide). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered vows (cerulean sorrow-resolve, gold steadiness, violet forgiveness) that reweight the central question of preservation against oblivion, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira seals the transcription and the library "exhales" warmer. Cost is implied—the slide dims entirely, "its magic spent"—but the cost feels more conceptual (the vow is translated, not erased) than felt in Elira's options or stance. The final walk toward "the next slide" suggests Earned Stasis (endurance of the archivist role) but without a visible path foreclosed or a choice that narrows her future, the closure reads more as affirmation than reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the trust-breaking sound she hunts materializes not as violence but as recognition, and she achieves her mission by triggering memory rather than confrontation. The causality is tight—fob touches wrist, Marla freezes, The Chain flees—and the cost is visible in the shattered deal and her solitary departure. Orientation anchors (pier, market, pre-sunrise) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drunkard's bump creates a false start that Marla dismisses, narrowing the window for the girl's final move.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (copper/ozone/honey) and the forest election motif build toward the man's absorption by the mycelium. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the storm dissolves, the skeptic shifts from doubt to trust), but the cost remains atmospheric—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible. The "emergent compass" and taste-sensing method function as mood rather than causal levers that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the cave descent, lock breaking, and portrait release accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to sovereignty). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lock snapping open and the final ascent offer closure, but the cost remains felt rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture of a relationship, tool, or future path is dramatized. One meaningful deepening (lock opens, portraits released) is present, sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The map-following structure provides clear causality through discrete discoveries (postal plate → child's note → chest of letters), and the final decision to become the archive constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (she abandons the search mode and accepts the burden of witness). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The cost—carrying the weight of testimony—is legible in the final image, though the turning point could be more compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or reweighting occurs; the tuner's routine continues unchanged until she "simply stopped climbing," an off-page exit that denies closure. The child encounter offers a potential turn, but no before/after stakes shift is legible—wonder is awakened in the child, yet the tuner's own options remain static. Orientation is delayed: "who" is named early, but "where" (bluff above clouds) and "when" (post-language world) accumulate slowly without clear anchors by ~120 words, though the effect does not critically obscure the ending. The absence of on-page cost at closure and the lack of a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt pressure disqualify high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (android, dome, desert, magnetic shift). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the burn sequence deepens and the roses spilling outward provide a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation rather than preservation). Cost is visible in the emptied box and the android's physical transformation (bioluminescent traceries grafted to machine). The magnetic shift completes in parallel with the caretaker's internal resolution, creating coherent closure. Minor causality softness: the irrigation fix feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly at dawn in the courtyard. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket's humming softens and Leo begins to talk, a shift toward communal healing. However, the mailbox "clicks" organically without prior rules, and Leo's transformation (from gaunt silence to "laughing—softly, tear-streaked, alive") compresses four mornings into summary rather than dramatized turns. Cost is implied (grief acknowledged) but not legible in a single on-page moment; the final image disperses across noon conversation and a child's seashell coda. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the courtyard's unexplained mechanism and summarized middle weaken causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story anchors who (Elira, code breaker), where (sunken lab), and when (after seven cycles, during an Overseer patrol) by the opening third, so no orientation penalty applies. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: phosphorescent algae, dice glyphs, dance notation, and journal capsules layer into a pattern of encrypted resistance. However, the final image—Elira "rewritten" as water surges and survivors dance her steps—declares closure rather than landing it with visible cost on the page. We cannot point to a sentence where a choice forecloses a path or a price is paid; the "harmony" collapse and the washed-ashore journals arrive as summary, not dramatized consequence. The lens holds, but closure lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elira, the chamber, after the whale's death) are clear by the opening. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterns accrue (coffee grounds, wildflowers, gravity pockets) until the final configuration opens the doorway. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elira steps through into the memory-pool reunion, reweighting her quest with undeniable pressure and felt cost (leaving her world). One tightening suffices: the coffee-ground spiral dissolves into the whale skeleton, then the doorway pattern. Cost is legible in the threshold-crossing and the tears "suspended mid-cheek."

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (reframing the prophecy from doom to plea), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or trade-off appears on the page. The origami wing's spiral and star-absorption read as conceptual payoff, yet the summoner's stance at the brook tomorrow is identical to tonight's; no option has been foreclosed. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: details accrue (meteor shower, seal, key, building's sentience) toward a final image that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt—she receives the key and descends with new knowledge, but no on-page price is paid; the building "knew she was coming" states resonance without dramatizing what she surrenders or risks. The escalation from sugar-borrowing to key-exchange operates through exposition ("he confessed") rather than scene pressure, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening occurs (the seal's purpose revealed), but the cost remains asserted, not shown in a concrete sentence or image at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening (who, where, when). The piece offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she chooses to archive rather than heal, leaving the shell as a node for others), but the cost remains abstract—no tactical option is visibly foreclosed, and the "before" stance is only told in reflection. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the ending image (walking away at dawn) reweights the opening dread, yet the escalation is primarily mood-driven cadence rather than a causal tightening that narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where promptly; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, building through aurora, dripping stalactites, and the thorn's glow toward a closure image (the rose blooming). The closure unit—scroll rewritten, curse lifted, rose blooming—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is asserted ("burden lifted") rather than shown as forfeiture or constraint. The final image charges the premise without a felt price that alters Elira's options beyond the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the entity is reduced but not destroyed, and the protagonist's throat-raw exhaustion signals cost. Orientation anchors early (canyon singer, serpentine nexus, starlight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—layers of echo-lore build toward the final singing confrontation—but causality is blurred: the shell's three-layer revelation arrives via summary exposition rather than dramatized discovery, and the entity's curiosity-to-compliance shift lacks a visible turn. The closure image ("sigh curled in the roots") reweights prior material, yet the cost feels asserted more than demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through image density (candle shrine, dream constellation, ice window) and a final cadence shift when the globe is placed and "the ice remembers." Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the globe's message is delivered, dream cameos fade, strangers' lives ripple. Cost is implied (the child's appearances end, the whisperer moves on) but not felt on the page as a foreclosed path or stake transformation. Orientation is clear by the opening lines; no penalty applied. One meaningful deepening (analyzing dreams → placing the globe) is present, but the final act lacks causal pressure—it completes a ritual rather than resolving contested options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through ritual gestures and lyric callbacks (whisk, whistle, fireflies), building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "I see you" crystallizes her stance. Orientation anchors clearly (parapet, rain, firefly season) by the opening lines. However, the closure moment carries thematic weight but no visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The widow's story seeds stakes but remains backstory; no present choice tests or alters her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she's here emerge slowly through exposition rather than anchored action, triggering the Q2 −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure is a continuation (she walks on with new coordinates) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The causal chain is a discovery-and-continue loop rather than escalating pressure. The "reassembling shredded letters" backstory is told in summary, not dramatized, weakening the causal spine.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (observatory, Elira, storm as veil), and the accumulative lens holds: the piece gathers fragmented signals toward a broadcast climax. However, the closure unit—her song triggering a carrier wave—lands as assertion rather than decisive reconfiguration; no on-page cost or reversal makes a before/after legible. The "whispers finding her" moment mid-story functions as validation, not a turn that narrows options. Cost is conceptual (she's risking exposure) but not felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece gathers sonic reliquaries and exchanges until the final jar with the child reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is delayed (vagrant poet, loft, dunes) but adequately anchored by the end of the first block. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the child clutches her grandmother's echo; the poet vanishes but his jars hum on), and the cost—his disappearance, his anonymity—is legible. However, the causal chain from repairing the music box to leaving jars on doorsteps is thin; the turn feels asserted rather than earned by prior pressure. The "he was gone" ending provides closure but the escalation leading to it is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the Heartstone's "sonic absolution" wave, but the cost remains abstract—scavengers kneel "in revelation" without on-page consequence or visible price paid by the protagonist. The causal chain from key insertion to counter-frequency to absolution reads mechanical rather than earned by prior struggle. The lens appears hybrid (causal setup, accumulative imagery), but the ending leans on告 conceptual assertion ("reminded the world") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who ("horizon mapper"), where (basalt sanctuary), and when (after freeze) emerge slowly across multiple paragraphs without early anchoring, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The piece lacks a causal turn or meaningful tightening—events accumulate but do not narrow options or change knowledge on the page. Closure reads as a restatement of the opening premise ("patient revolution") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is ambiguous; no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (memory layers build toward a final reweighting). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, when by ~80 words). The closure—leaving the lantern as anchor, the air growing still—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: stakes crystallize, reverberations soften but persist). Cost is felt (her body aches, names etched on her forearm, report will be dismissed) but the decisive tightening that narrows options is diffuse; the investigator's choice to leave the lantern doesn't foreclose a legible alternative path on the page. The accumulative design builds density, but the final beat reconfigures atmosphere more than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through months of failure, then the storm-light breakthrough reweights the dominant stake (fixing the heart = earning forgiveness). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the heart beats, the melody plays, and Elias accepts grace—felt cost is visible in his years of penance and the finality of wrapping the box. Orientation anchors quickly (shop, Elias, music box). One meaningful tightening (the shadow revelation) narrows options and changes knowledge, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (Zeta, workshop, acid sea) and follows a clear causal chain: arrow tip → Engine activation → kaleidoscope → transliteration → bell stir. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell's whisper for "the next world" crystallizes the yearning algorithm's purpose with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt in Zeta's exhaustion ("voice cracked," "slumped"), though the price could be sharper. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the transliteration sequence, and the final stirring (not ringing) reweights the stake with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (corporate memory keeper, archive desk, terminal) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through recurring 0707 markers, deleted-crew traces, and the janitor's whisper, building toward the 07:07 mass-restore action that triggers shadow-avatars—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the crew is confirmed to exist "in the gaps." Felt cost is present in her isolation, the lies, and the nightly 07:07 vigil. One tightening is sufficient at this length. Minor deduction: the crew's "de-referenced" fate and the mechanics of the restore are told more than dramatized, slightly softening causality in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the peacekeeper moves through the orchard, pressing the crystal to mirrors, accumulating glimpses of strangers' merciful choices, and arrives at her own reflection for a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when cohere only after ~150 words—triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure offers Charged Poise (the whispered question reframes her mission) but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a concrete action or forfeiture. The ice "groaning open" to reveal new paths reads metaphorical, not a dramatized consequence of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through sensory density and recurring motifs (parasol tip chime, glacier sigh, lace unraveling) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's shift from seeking endings to hearing "music between heartbeats." Cost is felt (she drifts alone, half-frozen) and the closure reweights prior material cleanly. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph. One minor slip: the Danish rescue and return feel compressed, softening the immediacy of the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal decisions braided with Accumulative/Textural reprise) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who: Elias; where: vacant station/vineyard pavilion; when: autumn dusk after final bus). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara pockets the letter edge "not as a keepsake of what was lost, but as a map of what could still grow," and Elias remains "guarding understanding"—the cost is relational distance accepted rather than collapsed, felt in "the space between them...no longer a chasm but a vineyard row." One minor gap: the cost could be more viscerally legible on the page rather than declared in metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a single continuous ritual scene with clear spatial anchors (pavilion, parapet, dunes) by the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the line walker kneels, feels the parapet respond, conjures clearings one by one, then departs—a density increase and cadence shift rather than causal linkage. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the clearings as invisible vessels and her ongoing journey, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The ritual succeeds without friction, and the parapet's cooperation feels assured rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~paragraph 3) without purposeful disorientation that pays off at closure (−0.4). No on-page closure effect: the protagonist will return tomorrow to do the same work with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that forecloses a path or reweights meaning. The ending is pure repetition without visible cost or stance crystallization. Drive lens remains unclear—attempts at accumulative texture fail to cohere into a meaningful tightening or cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: reticent scholar, shadowed library, dawn. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory details, reflective mapping, and the crystal's ritual until the final question reweights the scholar's stance. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the scholar stops transcribing and answers aloud, forecloses the data-collection path, and the final image ("The pattern was not in the past. It was in the pause.") reconfigures her methodology with felt cost (years of mapping now recognized as incomplete). The cost is conceptual and emotional, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory and conceptual density (fog, driftwood, tapes, chalk) toward a final auditory revelation—the sound of aging. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (he hears the sound he's chased for years, drops the chalk, knows he won't remember tomorrow); cost is legible in the foreclosed cycle and his trembling exit. Orientation anchors who and where early; the timeframe ("amid the hush of old videotapes") is atmospheric rather than clock-driven, acceptable under this lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chalk screech tears open the air and he finally locates the sound, reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure and tidal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where are anchored early, but "when" remains vague ("Time of Shaking Foundations") without clock or constraint legibility; apply −0.4. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "restructuring" occurs through metaphor ("time braided," "grammar restructured") without visible cost or forecloses options—no decision, renunciation, or endurance with on-page price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake; the hand "slows" but "never stopped," leaving the change ambiguous. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elira loses or pays.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is delayed—"ascended…to the radiant haven" appears before grounding who is acting or what choice anchors the present moment. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final hymn and dissolution of the shard, but cost is asserted ("her work was done") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or reweighted option. The "not by fixing…but by witnessing" summary tells the effect rather than showing a before/after legible through action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying the baseline test. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—rune study, repeated rituals, layered cosmological detail building toward the final reconciliation. However, closure feels more like thematic declaration than visible cost: Elira inscribes a rune and "maintains" a seal, but what she has renounced or lost to achieve this equilibrium remains unclear on the page. The seventeen-night ritual cycle suggests escalation, but the final image ("noon cast a shadow—not on the ground, but on time itself") reconfigures conceptually without a legible personal or relational price.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (kneeling skeptic, secret garden, changeling's tooth). The piece accumulates motifs—tooth, garden, bone-setting metaphor—and closes with the tooth pulsing and the protagonist teaching others, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she commits to her method). However, cost is more asserted than felt; no choice forecloses a live path with visible friction. The hinge from solitary work to communal teaching is told ("Later, townsfolk would find…") rather than dramatized, softening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (grotto, kneeling, sea glass). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through memory fragments, polishing ritual, and a final prismatic image. However, closure lacks decisive cost—the protagonist performs an unchanged ritual and the child's whispered line does not reweight prior options or impose a felt price. The ending offers a thematic assertion ("this was the method that mattered") rather than an on-page reconfiguration with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: moss-garden imagery and the thaw-pattern method accumulate density toward a reclamation stance. Orientation anchors appear by ~120 words (data center, post-confession timeframe). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis with an intention to return—but the cost is implied rather than legibly dramatized; the act of placing the confession beneath moss is symbolic without a visible tactical or emotional forfeiture that changes her present options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist, cameos, and the seashell fragment accumulate meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the pier. Orientation anchors arrive late—"who" is clear, but "when" and "where" remain abstract until the final third; apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test. The closure unit reweights her manuscript from "desperate" to "potential," but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. The seashell placement feels ceremonial without altering what follows.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail, the arbor's memory-hum, and the progression from brittle tune to full chorus. However, the closure—the vine forming a wreath and "sacred space—ready to be filled"—lacks a decisive cost or reweighting that makes a before/after legible with pressure. The harvest moon's work is described as "done" but the protagonist's stance or the world's options don't demonstrably narrow or change on the page; the ending feels more like thematic echo than earned reconfiguration. Application of −0.5 for Cost proof test: no exact sentence shows Elara forfeiting, enduring with visible loss, or crystallizing a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she kneels in this specific orchard emerge slowly through poetic description rather than anchored early. The story presents a ritual sequence without a meaningful turn or tightening that narrows options. The plate glows, she sees a map, she leaves—no decisive change, no visible cost, no path foreclosed. Under an Accumulative lens, the ending offers atmospheric completion but no reconfiguration that reweights the dominant stake with felt price. Closure form (RR or CR) is absent; the piece ends where it began with added ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout the cavern work. However, closure relies on Resonant Reconfiguration through summary declaration ("he'd remembered how to listen") rather than an on-page image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The "years later" coda attempts thematic payoff but occurs off-page and tells rather than shows consequence. Escalation is accumulative (reflections at 11:03, 3:17, dusk) but the final sealing and departure lack a visible price that alters the locksmith's stance or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lamp ritual accumulates sensory and conceptual weight until the weaver's final turn to her own locket shifts the pattern from service to self-care. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she chooses endurance over escape, aligning with her calling at visible cost (continuing the cycle). The final image reweights "boundary-lessly trapped" from burden to purpose. One meaningful deepening is present; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (widow, loft, rain, present moment). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the carving's evolution, the kettle's insistent song, and the mantra "here and gone" recurring with shifted weight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): placing the half-formed lion in light reconfigures her stance from containing memory to letting it exist in the open, with the cost felt in "Let the pot scorch. Some things mattered more than tea." One tightening—ignoring the kettle to finish the work—narrows her options and crystallizes her new relationship to loss. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece commits to an accumulative/lyric lens with temporal ellipsis and metaphorical layering, but closure suffers from insufficient on-page cost: the envelope's message and the ghost's dissolution feel like conceptual gestures rather than a decisive change with visible price. The "you were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it" lands as thematic statement rather than a reconfiguration charged by prior pressure, and the protagonist's shift from regret to peace lacks the concrete forfeiture or visible tradeoff that would earn Resonant Reconfiguration status.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (Elira enters the terminal with clear intent) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens throughout: density builds through steam redirection, light manipulation, and visitor arrival, culminating in the equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" as a Conceptual Repricing moment. The cost, however, is oblique—the terminal "still cracked" and "still sloped" offers a visible constraint, but Elira herself pays no legible personal price at closure. The equation feels asserted rather than dramatized as a trade-off, weakening the closure's felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence shift reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the vaulted chamber paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias accepts the dream's transformation rather than resurrecting it, humming instead of composing grand works. Cost is conceptual—the foreclosure of cathedral ambitions—but the final image dilutes pressure with abstract phrasing ("peace," "wonder," "petrichor nostalgia") rather than a concrete, charged moment. No causality break, but the ending tells transformation rather than showing a decisive visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): understanding replaces chase, salvage becomes restoration, the seeker walks away "settled" rather than triumphant—a stance crystallization with visible cost (ending the hunt, carrying loss not proof). The canal exhales and "no longer needed to keep" its secrets, reweighting the premise. Cost is felt in the shift from seeking legends to honoring ruins. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket's inscription delivers hindsight clarity, narrowing options to acceptance. The lens holds through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: the protagonist's realization that she now collects "hands" (living practice) rather than seeds (artifacts) constitutes a Conceptual Repricing, and the final image of the rope "coiled in her arms like a sleeping serpent of wisdom" reweights the opening's fulgurite with felt cost (the shift from passive preservation to active transmission). Orientation is clean. The escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening—each knot taught accumulates meaning—but the cost remains somewhat abstract; we don't see what she risks or loses by this shift in mission.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (traveler), where (shadowed garden), and when (autumn twilight, "after the last ship sails") within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memories, sensory detail, and the act of writing to deepen the traveler's cartographic grief without a causal turn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the traveler stands, renounces prayer, and commits to mapping—with conceptual cost legible in the line "They mapped. And in mapping absence, they made the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present." The single meaningful deepening occurs when the traveler finishes Elira's obituary and folds it into a crane, reweighting the act from solitary ritual to potential transmission. No causality breaks, and the lens holds through the ending, though the piece skirts illustrative summary in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of density increase and charged imagery early; the final image reweights the prince's project with undeniable emotional cost (tears, laughter, decades of isolation) and conceptual repricing (beauty as oxygen, genesis enough). Orientation anchors—bedraggled prince on suspended palace—arrive promptly. The egg's pulsing transformation and birdsong eruption constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): options crystallize (hatch or not, beauty stirred) and pressure is felt even if the hatch is deferred. Cost is legible: years of despair, exile, and the prince's physical reduction. No causality breaks; the accumulative design holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lagoon ritual, father's coin, and black sand accrue meaning through density and pattern rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights her inheritance ("not in ash, but in watercolor") and she runs toward fire with kelp-drift peace. Orientation is clean (who, where, when by line 3), and the ending reconfigures the father's legacy with felt cost (she carries his name and his contradictory fire-knowledge). One meaningful deepening occurs when the obsidian figure offers witness and she threads the cord, crystallizing her stance: not to bury, but to harmonize.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early; time is marked by the paused geese but remains largely atmospheric. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the protagonist moves from fountain to fountain, releasing compressed memories through the stained glass box, and the final drop signals resonance rather than decisive change. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the city's silence deepens into reverence), but the cost is implied rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or altered option for the skeptic herself. One meaningful tightening occurs at Fountain Twelve; causality is clean within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/what/when remain vague until mid-piece), triggering the penalty. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration via the gear's transformation and the sentimentalist's transit, but cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—rust flakes, teeth turn, no visible price paid or option foreclosed. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern and cadence shift), and one tightening occurs (gear begins to turn), meeting minimum threshold but lacking concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when clearly within the opening. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory detail, ribbon-tying, and poem fragments build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the penultimate paragraph when Silas places his palm over Elias's heart and Elias understands grief as "a current to be joined." However, the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture, trade-off, or altered tactic proves the reweighting. The ending image ("no longer carving alone") restates the epiphany without additional pressure or price, leaving closure underdeveloped for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear (tower, ridge, pendulum) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated motifs (pendulum pause, inscriptions, tide) toward a reconfiguration at the end. However, the closure unit—Elias choosing not to wind and experiencing grace—lacks visible cost; he gains peace without forfeiting a live stake (the clocks still run, trains still operate). The rake-handle inscriptions arrive late (past midpoint) and resolve the conflict they did not help create, undermining causal earn. The ending reweights meaning through tone and image but the felt price is absent, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges slowly across the opening, and the chess-clock timeframe is mentioned once without anchoring the reader in a clear present moment. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—density builds through the tapestry ritual—but closure relies on conceptual repricing ("intentions were not destinations, but gestures") rather than a decisive change with legible cost. The final image (whispering questions) reweights prior material, yet the cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the shift undeniable. Lens holds, but the ending leans into theme-statement rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure effect: the cartographer performs a ritual that "invites" off-stage actors (engineers, poets, children) whose future actions are summarized in conditional mood. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early but deflates it by summarizing hypothetical outcomes rather than landing a reweighted present image with felt cost. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (name, location, and stakes clarify only after the frozen lake paragraph), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The dominant stake—seeding innovation—is stated but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear late: who she is (copyist) and her motivation emerge gradually across the first third rather than by ~120 words, though the alcove setting is clear early. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—density increases through the pirate broadcasts, dust-memories coalesce, and the final transmission reweights her role from scribe to broadcaster—but the closure effect, while present, carries minimal felt cost on the page; she "waited, thistled calm" without dramatizing what she risks or forecloses by transmitting. The final image gestures toward reciprocity ("another alcove would warm") but does not make the personal or social price undeniable. Causality is loose: the radio becomes transmitter without prior setup of that capability, and the tears-as-code feels convenient rather than earned through prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through ritual cadence and returns to the rocking chair and mask motifs, but closure lacks visible cost—the final image (sitting motionless, eyes closed, "truth… gloriously, somberly real") asserts rather than demonstrates a felt price. The patron's cathartic departure and the scatterer's unchanged stance suggest Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), yet no live option is foreclosed on the page; she performs the same ritual with the same conviction. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). The piece coheres under its chosen lens but the ending reweights meaning primarily through assertion ("mirage of safety fades") rather than a concrete image or action that makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: who (philosopher in sewer), where (inverted archive/sunken city), when (after plague). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens with Situational pressure—sedimentary layers, cataloging, and the final bell-tower moment build density and crystallize his stance against the Council's erasure narrative. Closure achieves Charged Poise: the whispered coordinates and the water's subtle shift reconfigure his endurance as geological resistance, with conceptual cost (isolation, rejection of reconstruction) legible in the contrast between steel obelisk above and submerged sundial below. One meaningful deepening occurs when he moves from passive cataloging to active ritual (bell tower), tightening his commitment. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (stillness as accrual, awaiting a deepening moment). Closure reads as Charged Poise: the girl's question crystallizes Elara's stance and the cost of decades spent showing up is undeniable in "traveled stillness" and the weathered calm. Orientation is clean by line 2 (who, where, autumn). One escalation beat: the creak from the stacks tightens anticipation into the girl's entrance. However, the final exchange feels emotionally convenient—no friction tests Elara's claim that she still teaches, and the cost remains implicit rather than visible in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with clear spatial anchors (greenhouse, twin moons) but drifts into extended lyric reflection without causal pressure. The seed planting at midnight produces a sprout that grows perfectly; no reversal or tightening narrows options. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration in tone—Elara returns each evening—but no felt cost is legible on the page; the greenhouse transforms without sacrifice, neighbors soften without friction, and the protagonist's stance never crystallizes under pressure. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the closure lacks a meaningful cadence shift or reweighting with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: "The tower doesn't collect lightning. It collects belief," reweights the entire premise with the drones' hum as confirmation. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—matchbox exchanges build density, the tower climb deepens mystery, nectar-dusk imagery charges the final beat. Orientation is swift (toll keeper, tower, blackout context by opening lines). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias and the woman discover the drones are capacitors, narrowing interpretation and raising thematic stakes. Cost is conceptual but legible: wonder preserved through withholding requires silence and trust.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ritual at the bay accumulates sensory and conceptual density. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by paragraph four—acceptable for lyric mode but delayed enough to create mild drift. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (a ritual completion that reweights the vanished cottage's departure) but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. The final paragraph summarizes intent ("keep walking, keep noticing") instead of landing a decisive image, weakening the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through cascading revelations (ampoule → glyphs → garden's animate truth → statue's dissolution) with a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors (living statue, underwater garden, diver) land by ~80 words. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden and citizens are reweighted from "drowned failure" to "chosen fluidity," and the historian becomes carrier of nuance. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique; we don't see her forfeit a concrete belief, relationship, or prior tactic on the page—only receive a new mandate. The revelations cascade smoothly but the final image ("You are the thread now") charges theme more than it dramatizes a trade-off, keeping this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear early (protagonist, infinite staircase, the chipped die as compass). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring proofs, the die's clicks, the 37-step landings, building to the moment the staircase ripples and the reflection appears. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the die vanishes, he climbs on carrying "the captured texture")—the cost is conceptual (loss of the relic, acceptance of the missed opportunity as material rather than burden). One friction: the ripple and reflection feel like an external gift rather than a consequence of his agency, softening the earned quality of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the painter's nightly ritual accumulates pressure through repetition, charged objects (brush, glyphs), and the resonant final beat when the girl joins her. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the shared painting reweights the dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) and crystallizes a before/after (solitary offering → collaborative continuation). Cost is felt but conceptual: the painter's solitary vigil ends, foreclosing her private certainty. The lens holds; the cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and rituals toward a cultural renaissance, with the bread-baking custom as the pattern that gradually thaws the community. Orientation is present early (grotto city, Elara, emerald lens), and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—the city transforms from refuge to sanctuary. However, the cost remains abstract; no on-page moment shows what Elara or the community sacrificed or foreclosed to achieve this shift. The progression feels more like accretion of positive outcomes than a tightening with visible price, weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: yoyo mechanism → mainspring → stone activation → gear retrieval → world rewriting. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, rocky island, low tide, clockmaker) arrive early. The closure unit—lifting the gear and accepting its weight—lands on the page with conceptual cost ("carried its weight alone," "No gods had intervened"). However, the causality of the yoyo-as-message-from-future-self introduces a paradox loop ("the one he would forge tomorrow") that the text acknowledges but does not resolve, creating mild ambiguity about whether the protagonist's agency drives the outcome or whether he is fulfilling a pre-written loop, slightly undermining the "step beyond fate" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images of reflection, luminance, and cursed photography toward a conceptual repricing of fear as self-generated echo. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. However, the closure unit—Fear dissolving when shown the protagonist's memories—feels more like symbolic cancellation than earned pressure release; the mechanism by which "lingering luminance" burns Fear lacks prior setup (the clasp pulses when fear nears, but light-as-weapon is introduced only at the confrontation). The final walk-out registers conceptual resolution but the felt cost remains diffuse: what specific path was foreclosed by unbosoming is unclear beyond the abstract defeat of a dread-construct.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered musical imagery until the clouds dissolve into harmonic rain, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—"the tide turned...inward" gestures at consequence without making a before/after choice legible. The Prophet's palm-press and Kael's mallet-strike are beats, but they do not narrow options or foreclose a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern language refines across seventeen seasons, the whistle's code deepens, and the watcher's fractional head-turn reconfigures the stakes. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the protagonist packs and commits to the climb, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure even though the cost is not yet paid on the page. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when anchored). One meaningful tightening occurs when the watcher responds, narrowing her theory into actionable certainty and driving the midnight decision.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: finding the letter enables the plan to publish, which will reshape public memory. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost; the historian's decision to write and speak is narrated in future summary ("She'd write… She'd speak") rather than dramatized with a visible price paid at the ending beat. The final image (walking away with resolve) gestures toward Charged Poise but the stakes remain abstract—no concrete obstacle, counter-pressure, or forfeiture marks the moment of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, submerged pavilion, after drawbridge rises) land within the first paragraph. The discovery of the bride's letter deepens the stakes and the act of copying it with the inkwell's last drops functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from surveyor to "priestess of the submerged," her role reweighted by witnessed absence. Cost is legible: the inkwell empties, she weeps, and she "felt lighter—not hollow, but clarified." The accumulative design (repeated note-placements building to the sealed letter) coheres under the textural lens and the closure lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates investigative discoveries—grain ledger, sealed vents, Master Index—that deepen the portrait of deliberate erasure, and the final stamp inscription offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (testimony preserved, stillness reclaimed). Cost is conceptual and relational (solidarity with the silenced) rather than a decisive change in the indexer's options, which keeps closure in the RR band. The lens holds; the tightening is meaningful but the price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (cranes, lanterns, gems, shadow) and delivers a closure moment when Silas releases the captive dreams and drops the sapphire, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow softens, the crane appears, warmth returns). Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coheres only after the second paragraph—but the lyric pattern is taught early enough that the effect feels purposeful. Cost is implied (he shatters every lantern, lets the final gem fall) but remains abstract; we don't see a concrete trade-off or foreclosed option on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow "drank the dreams greedily," shifting the dynamic from antagonist to mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through layered simulation attempts, geode pulses, and coordinate reveals, culminating in the decision to engage thrusters. Orientation anchors (survivor, observatory, geosynchronous orbit) land by ~15% of text. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes her hunt's next phase with undeniable pressure ("the observatory leapt into the dark"), and the cost—solitary pursuit of spectral imprints with no mission control—is felt. One tightening occurs when new coordinates emerge and she queues thrusters, narrowing options from passive simulation to active pursuit. Minor causality slip: the geode's "alien harmonics" are introduced late without prior grounding in her trauma-tuned perception, slightly weakening the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—she stops searching and begins listening—but the cost remains abstract: no tactical path is visibly foreclosed on the page, and the chip's work "done" arrives by assertion. The pilgrim's arrival creates a timeframe constraint that never tightens decisions. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural; the final image reweights the premise, but the pressure does not deepen through a second beat that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (cobalt terrace, Elira, dusk, watch hand) within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through layered imagery (driftwood carvings, father's face, memory flood) and resolves via Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira accepts the truth as ballast rather than burden, forecloses her prior trade, and commits to truth-weaving—a visible stance shift with opportunity cost. The driftwood discovery and memory transfer feel convenient (the carving "bore her father's face" exactly when needed), weakening causal rigor, but the accumulative design tolerates this under its lens and the closure crystallizes her new path with legible emotional and professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is clear early (parapet, mist, waiting). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ghost-swapping realization and the final walking-together image offer a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains largely asserted rather than dramatized—no concrete choice is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The exchange of drawer pull and key happens without friction, and the descent feels like mutual agreement rather than a hard-won closure that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear (coastal launch, dusk, solo figure with compass). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of metaphor and a cadence shift (from stasis to paddling) reweight the dominant stake (internal coherence vs. regret). However, closure relies on Resonant Reconfiguration (the compass needle stilling, pointing toward her stern) without a legible on-page cost—what path is foreclosed, what is risked or spent? The "no longer broken, now becoming" declaration substitutes assertion for a dramatized price, weakening the closure effect required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers images (newspaper codes, underground descent, bioluminescent water, submerged objects) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—the seeker's internal map shifts from emptiness to "resonance." Cost is legible: the baseball released, the climb back without retrieval, acceptance of an unending labyrinth. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (seeker at lake edge, Layer 7 location, Kael's entrance). One meaningful deepening occurs when ripples reveal the pain-images, kindling empathy's spark.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly; the orchard setting and phoenix-summoning goal are clear. However, the closure lacks decisive cost: the phoenix simply returns, the bond "reforges," and they walk together without any on-page forfeiture or narrowed option. The spice-conjuring mechanism operates as decoration—no failed attempt, no tactical adjustment—so the ending reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned reconfiguration. Under a Causal lens, the "because" chain dissolves into poetic assertion at the moment of return.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (shard, moss, phantom tablecloths) and the saucer's fracture opening functions as threshold. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the shard becomes whole, the mother descends transformed—but cost remains oblique; "surrender" and "lighter heart" are told, not shown through a specific forfeited option. Orientation anchors late: "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "midnight glade above clouds" are vivid but "after the birth—not of a child, but of silence" delays who/what/when clarity past ~120 words without teaching disorientation as pattern. The piece coheres under its lens but the Cost Proof Test is weak: no exact sentence makes the price legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through photographs, tears, and stitching until the gate opens. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—stepping through the gate into reunion—is on the page, but the cost is conceptual (loneliness dissolved) rather than viscerally felt; the ship's sigh and the mist-dissolving locket gesture toward sacrifice without grounding it in a choice Elira must renounce. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow detaches and reframes burden as wing, yet this moment is told rather than shown through a concrete choice that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via accumulative release gestures, but the closure lacks legible cost—"empty-handed, barefoot, radiant" asserts transformation without showing what path was foreclosed. Orientation anchors arrive late (beach/volcano/bugs established slowly across opening paragraphs). The repeated bottle-opening beats follow an and-then structure rather than because/therefore linkage; each bug's effect is told ("a fisherman miles away mended his nets") rather than dramatized on the page, breaking immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied. The piece operates in Causal mode (she descends to plant coded messages, completes the task, returns to watch dawn), but no reversal or tightening occurs—the blackout conveniently clears guards' attention, no obstacle materializes, and the final image announces success without an on-page cost or decision that narrows options. Closure reads as Declared Success rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. The sundial mechanics and the phrase "cradle of sparks" are named but do not constrain a choice or shift tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered imagery (aurora, eels, painted rocks, star dust) toward a final crystallization where the herder understands the method rather than the answer—a valid Conceptual Repricing. Orientation anchors arrive early (tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless world). The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt; the herder "learns" but we don't see what he loses or what path is foreclosed. The because/therefore linkage is weak—events happen in parallel (he places rocks, eels respond) without clear causal pressure forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates storm imagery, timer ticks, and the sealed envelope toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she chooses not to open the envelope, a renunciation that forecloses immediate catharsis). Orientation anchors who and where early; when remains abstract ("stormlit" night, no clock time). The cost is conceptual—she accepts perpetual vigil—but the final image ("became her own archive, her own atlas") asserts the reweighting rather than showing a visible tradeoff or forfeited path. One meaningful deepening occurs (timer reaches zero, she does not reset it), but causality is thin; no because/therefore linkage forces the choice. The closure reads as thematic declaration more than felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the sundial's shadow moves toward alignment, the needle card reveals a pattern, and the partners transcribe the score. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (partnership formed, purpose declared), but the cost remains aspirational rather than legible on the page—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed. The causality of the discovery is clean, yet the final image ("perform it…everywhere") asserts stakes without demonstrating sacrifice or consequence in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (vagrant poet, rusted library, nighttime), but the closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration that relies on cumulative symbolic gestures (candle, seeds, song) rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint, and the final image (planting seeds, singing into ruin) does reweight the dominant stake (forging beauty from anarchy), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page moment where we see what Molt sacrifices or risks. The "by dawn, someone would find" projection gestures toward consequence but externalizes impact rather than landing it in her body or immediate circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—we learn "tidal arbor above the clouds" and the pianist setup early, but the spatial logic (floating dais, projector mechanics, how film images materialize as compasses) remains vague past the first third, triggering a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: musical escalation layered with compass symbolism and clock ticks, building to the chord that "shatters" the horizon and summons laughter. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the final moment crystallizes Elira's defiance and reconfigures fate's script—but the cost (she doesn't turn toward the laughter) is oblique and felt rather than visible. One meaningful tightening (the clock advancing from 11:53 to midnight) reweights prior material, meeting the length default, but the film-reel mechanics and compass physics feel ornamental rather than causally constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an **Accumulative/Textural** lens: ritual preparation, chant, seed activation, memory eruption, autonomous archive. The closure unit is a **Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)**: the system is live, villagers gather wet-eyed, memories are rooted deeper than the monsoon can reach. Cost is conceptual (the seed is gone, replaced by a living library) but the final image reweights the premise. However, **orientation debt** is present: who/where/when are not anchored until well past 120 words (the ridge and monsoon context emerge gradually through lush description). Applying **−0.4** for delayed grounding and the cap per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: post-flood return → dust experiments and observations → social response → spiral revelation → long-term integration and teaching. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing, reweighting neutron stars and dust into one continuum, with the career and reputational cost legible in the colleagues’ judgment. Causality holds at this scale, and the progression of dust behavior is coherent and purposeful. The stakes stay largely conceptual and contemplative, so the final turn, while satisfying, lands more as elegant realization than sharp structural jolt.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is accumulative/textural, cohering around her movement from stunned survival to meaning-making, with the key causal beat being the frost pattern that matches the ledger and recodes the smugglers’ role. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets the ledger as a map of mercy and transforms it into an altar, and her life into a ritual of “retracing.” Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when and what “the attempt” was are legible enough), and there is no causality break. The arc is quiet and largely internal, but the midpoint discovery and subsequent use of that knowledge give it sufficient structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: entry into the conservatory → methodological recap → first experiment at the fountain as a proof-of-concept → a montage of activations → quiet closure with renewed commitment. The drive lens is textural/accumulative, and under that lens the closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: her understanding of the “silent” world is deepened and stabilized, and the reader can feel a before/after. Causality is intact at this scale, with each step feeling like a natural extension of the prior one. The cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatized (no decisive trade-off), which keeps the structure from feeling fully peak-level.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious package → realization of distress signals → decision to repurpose the lens → embedded prisms and gathering souls → transformed beacon and undertaker. The accumulative structure of actions in the library builds coherently to a resonant reconfiguration where distress becomes belonging. Some middle beats are summarized (the method coming in a dream, the process of occupying “impossible spaces”), but they don’t break logic or obscure stakes. Closure is strong and on-page: his world and inner stance are clearly different at the end, with the ongoing mission framed under a new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: repeated midnight runs, the bell, and sanctions pressure build toward the communal ringing and handover. Causality is clean—sanctions worsen, mutual aid expands, the bell’s meaning evolves—and the final Charged Poise image (bell waiting for a successor) creates a legible before/after in how the community owns the practice. Structure is cohesive despite spanning time; the “longest night” scene and first bell ring are a true tightening. Escalation is quiet rather than dramatic, but still purposeful and resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: present-tense scene under the viaduct → vision in the obscura → breath-led pursuit → encounter and transformation with the pilgrim, all causally linked within a mystic but coherent rule set. The Global Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds via breath, imagery, and legend toward a Conceptual Repricing closure (“Unused love was not stored; it was sung.”). Closure lands clearly with a before/after in her understanding and stance, and cost is implied in her surrender to the reservoir. The absence of harder external obstacles or timed constraints keeps the arc from feeling as structurally taut as it could at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: present-tense work in the garden, contextualized by backstory, tightens into the inversion event and realization about the wound in causality. Causality is strong within the chosen mode: touching the fragment leads to inversion, loss of photographs, and a reconfiguration of her relationship to the garden and time. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she relinquishes the photographs and chooses to continue in symbiosis with the wound. Stakes and cost are legible on the page, though the transition from horror to acceptance could be slowed slightly for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: mistaken capture → access to the prize center → decoding the piano → opening the vault → seeding world and leaving a key for successors. The wall’s impending fall and raiders’ return provide a situational clock that underwrites her urgency, even if confrontation stays off-page. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the mission is executed, future pressure is handed to “those who’d come after,” and the world’s options are reweighted toward eventual green. The main limitation is that the central operation proceeds almost too smoothly, with little structural complication once she reaches the bench.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is strong from the outset: we know who she is, where she is, and what she wants within the first lines, and the accumulative/textural structure is taught early and held. The causal chain is clean for a lyric piece: she forges by burning absences, escalates by feeding in her sister’s absence, hears the trust-fracture, forges the device, then leaves. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she has built the memory-catcher and reoriented her life’s trajectory away from the greenhouse with a cost. The only structural limitation is that the global “before it was too late for others” stake remains abstract, with no concrete test or near-failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: we move through a series of linked interventions in one station-night, each beat clarifying the rules and purpose of her art, then cadence out as the jar empties and she leaves. The causal chain is accumulative rather than plot-twist-driven, but each flower placement + moonbeam use produces a small, legible change in the world (reunions) that culminates in an RR-style closure with the image of her departing, depleted but fulfilled. Orientation (who/where/when and the core conceit) is crystal-clear very early and never wobbles. The main limitation is that there’s no real structural complication or setback; the pattern only intensifies, it never meaningfully threatens to fail.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: a sequence of deliberate acts in the control room builds toward her departure and the later off-page discovery by the child. Causality is clean—her making and placing the spheres leads plausibly to one traveling via meltwater and being found. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the bookmark-in-glass and the child’s first felt question conceptually reprice all prior images. The cost is quiet but legible: she relinquishes any claim to control outcomes, accepting anonymity and the uncertainty of whether her work will matter.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: discovery of the cast and shell → weeks of decoding → directive to the projector → retrieval and burning of the reel → internal release. The piece cleanly follows a single throughline in one scene with interwoven backstory; orientation (who/where/what now) is legible early and remains stable. Closure is a decisive change plus reconfiguration: destroying the film forecloses a path in her career/identity and reweights her relationship to both mentor and fear. The only limitation is that external obstacles in the library and projector sequence remain light, keeping the plot from feeling truly crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: single scene, one drive (map the endless night), and a clear closure when she descends into the territory she has charted. The because/therefore chain is subtle but intact: last star dimming → urgency of mapping → completion → entry into the mapped night. Closure functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts self-effacement into the very night she’s mapped, with conceptual cost. The main limitation is that escalation remains gentle; the storm and the star-clock suggest pressure but never sharply constrict options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is very clean: the loops (first, second, seventh, twelfth, etc.) build a clear pattern of increasing nuance that culminates in the internal voice and conceptual realization. Causality works under this lens—the more echoes amalgamated, the closer it comes to recognizing its own interiority—leading to a satisfying Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure is strong: the robot’s stance toward sweeping and listening is reconfigured with an evident “before/after” in understanding and tactic. Stakes stay coherent throughout, though they remain almost entirely internal and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece adheres cleanly to a single-scene accumulative structure: preparation → gathering → communal response → quiet aftermath, with no orientation or lens confusion. Causality is soft but coherent—her prior eavesdropping motivates the ritual; the lens and moonlight lead to the gathering; the gathering leads to the thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s stance toward mistrust shifts and the broken lens marks completion. The cost (emotional exposure, the lens cracking) is on the page, even if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous scene with accumulative beats (marble rituals → intern’s demand → reciprocal acknowledgment from the garden) leading to an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Causality under a textural lens holds: institutional pressure arrives, she refuses, and the garden “answers,” reweighting the premise. Orientation is excellent from the opening and the world rules around measurable luck, drones, and bands are consistent. The closure’s cost (defying her institution, accepting isolation and obsolescence) is mostly implied rather than dramatized in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: long obsession → lever pull → nexus convulsion → encounter with adjacent self → calibration choice → conceptual reframing and log entry. Structure is tight, single-scene, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time is now understood as “breathing sideways,” reweighting all prior work. However, the cost at closure is mostly implied and intellectual; despite the ominous warning (“Don’t let go”), nothing fractures or is lost, which softens the before/after edge. The global drive reads as Causal with a conceptual ending, and that lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → decoding the program → ghost manifestation → silent performance → mutual release, with each beat growing out of the last. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the ending offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the opera house and flood are re-understood as co-composers, and her life-purpose is reweighted. Causality holds—nothing teleports or resolves by convenience—and the closure is on-page and legible. The cost at the end is more conceptual/emotional than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear before/after pivot at the fever breaking, progressing through two oracle queries to the choice on the gantry and the redefined understanding of “fault-tolerant.” Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: she does not confess the truth but reconfigures how she will carry it, with the orchid’s smudge and her “first true inhale” as cost markers. Causality is accumulative rather than plotty but coherent: each exchange with the oracle deepens the central question. A touch more concrete consequence for the swallowed truth itself could raise the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: confession → hush/intolerable silence → investigation based on calls → discovery of the wheel and radio → recognition of her own voice → revaluation and choice. The global drive reads Hybrid with an accumulative textural build toward a clear conceptual repricing at the end. The transistor radio still working and the “unconsciously lugged here” line skate close to convenience, but they function as psychological rather than literal realism and don’t break closure. The ending offers a solid Earned Stasis/CR mix: she cannot undo the deaths but reconfigures her relation to the guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: library → refuge → vision of aeons → return, with a clear before/after reconfiguration of stance. Entry via the origami swan gives a concrete hinge, and the re-encounter with the unchanged refuge on return provides closure. Causality is lyrical rather than strictly plotted, but the internal logic of this archive and the keeper’s choices holds. The cost—alteration without consolation—is legible at the end, so closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: private ritual → unexpected eclipse → communal gathering → shared song → transfer of the curl → quiet exit. Causality is clear (the eclipse draws villagers; her choice to sing and reveal the curl invites intimacy), and the piece coheres as one continuous scene with a single stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s anchor passes to a child, signaling a before/after in her stewardship of wonder. The cost is subtle but legible, and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: probe → diaries → displaced axis pattern → tapestry re-reading → decision to seek the loom, with each discovery building coherently on the last. Orientation is excellent; we always know where we are (reclaimed silo library) and what she’s doing. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s wound is conceptually reframed as something that can be addressed through “weaving” testimony, and she commits to action. The main limitation is that the cost and urgency of this decision remain conceptual rather than concretely pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative mosaic: early vignettes teach the pattern of “accidentally prophetic” fortunes, which is then reweighted by the analyst’s arrival and job request. Causality within this lens is coherent—Elias’s methods lead to community responses, which attract the analyst. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with Elias expanding his “orchestra” while the lighthouse’s indifferent continuity reframes authorship and control. Stakes remain low-intensity and contemplative rather than sharply tested, but the arc itself is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with mounting rhetorical trials leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end (the void is trapped in the question instead of the priest). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: questions → spatial warping → possession’s hesitation → final question-mark trap. The closure is legible and satisfying, though the cost is mostly conceptual, with little sense of what enduring consequence this leaves for the priest beyond “deeper, richer” silence. A slightly sharper articulation of the before/after constraint on him personally would push structure closer to elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: ritual setup → mapping memories → conducting → crescendo with the lake and horizon → quiet aftermath. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent; each intensification of memory leads to a larger sonic/visual response, culminating in the horizon’s split and the charged final recognition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she hasn’t “won” anything concrete, but her relationship to trying—and to memory as score—has shifted in a legible before/after. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual, which is apt for the mode but keeps this just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: viaduct → corridor/room → staircase of dates → echoes and confessions → tablet blooming, with each step deepening rather than merely repeating. Causality holds under a textural lens: the tablet’s call leads to corridors which lead to confrontations and finally integration; closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph—who, where, what’s happening are all anchored—so there’s no orientation debt. If anything, the emotional/ontological stakes of success or failure could be slightly more concretely framed.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative lens: creeping numbness → discovery of the needle and remembered method → experiment → communal rupture → reconfigured practice. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to silence and void shifts in a legible before/after with cost in the form of exposed pain. Orientation is solid from the opening, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups. The single-scene flow feels tight and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: an uneasy arrival leads to discovery of the tube, revelation of the breach, and a decision to pursue an off-grid investigation. Structure is linear and coherent with a clear closure unit in the charged poise of him stepping into the rail yard having chosen a path of clandestine resistance. However, cost at the end is mostly conceptual and projected; no on-page consequence or narrowed option beyond “he’s now in danger” is dramatized. The drive lens reads as largely causal with situational overtones and holds, but escalation could tighten more sharply around a specific irreversible step.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the greenhouse → opening the long-kept vial → sensory/memory flood → UV revelation → conceptual reframing of grief → exit with a new mission. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens; each move is a clear “therefore” from the prior one (her collapse of memory leads to using the lamp, which leads to visible glyphs and realization). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines grief’s function and her own role, with cost visible in her weeping and the years of delay. The scene stays continuous and legible without temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: grotto contemplation → revelation via beings’ light → descent to the village → rope laid as mediator → village begins weaving a bridge. Causality is soft but present (her understanding leads her to intervene, the beings’ presence charges both revelation and village crisis). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the village’s paralysis reframed into a bridge-building project and the poet’s quest shifting from answers to “richer questions.” Stakes remain conceptual rather than situationally tight, but there is a clear before/after in how impossible choices are held.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear and effective: sound → ripples → greenhouse response → child’s emergence → charged final image. Causality in a literal sense is soft, but under the chosen lens the escalating responses of environment and listener coherently build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the chronic hush reweighted as “sacred.” Closure lands cleanly in the image of the petal floating in the mendicant’s bowl and the poised return to playing, with a felt cost in accepting incompleteness rather than repair. The brief backstory shard about the grandmother is well anchored by the bonfire motif and reorients the present without derailing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric surface: Vael acquires/uses the petal, experiences another’s solitude, then changes her practice in direct response. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when and what she does are immediately clear), and the piece holds a single coherent scene with internal modulation. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she abandons counterfeit wares and accepts social and economic ruin for a different kind of work. The drive lens remains consistent and the final vow is firmly grounded in the preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mistaken envelope cleanly incites the action, and the story follows a coherent causal chain from Elias’s choice to copy the gesture through to the harbor-wide change. The accumulative structure of deliveries and reactions is easy to follow and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: the community now continues the cycle without him needing to prompt it. Closure is present and conceptually satisfying, but the lack of on-page cost or real obstacle makes the arc feel low-pressure. Still, for this length, the pattern is taught and paid off with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: encounter with arbor/tag → investigative middle via reed-clues and growing attention → note and moonlit journey → revelation of the arbor’s true function and Lira’s integration. Causality holds throughout and the closure is a solid resonant reconfiguration as she moves from seeker to node of community. The price—relinquishing her purely solitary identity—is conceptually clear but emotionally under-tested, with little sense of a path foreclosed beyond abstract loneliness. Still, the ending image (her greeting new travelers at the arbor) lands as a coherent “after” state that reweights the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clear and cumulative: rooftop traversal → overborrowing scare → descent into the echo womb → successful “birth” of new sound → reconfigured city. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—each use of borrowed time escalates risk and leads logically to borrowing from the giant’s dream. Closure is strong: the city’s waking with birdsong and her putting the pendant away reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost, though the price remains more implied than viscerally dramatized. No orientation issues; the single-POV window and temporal frame across the nap are legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, single-scene structure and sustains it cleanly: arrival in the silent orchard → ritual with the eyes/mosaic → revelation of Aris’s message → reoriented purpose. Causality is tight at this scale (moon angle + eyes + stepping stone → equation/message → coordinates/frequency → decision to go deeper). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: loss reframed as loss of language, not person, and a new quest defined with cost (leaving an “anchor” eye, accepting distance). No orientation or lens ambiguity debt; before/after is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: habitual searching → discovery of the tape → decision to place it → institutional recognition → reconfigured stance at the end. Causality is tight under a textural lens, with each object and action building toward the charged staff-note moment, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after in her options for connection. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities, and the cost—remaining hidden despite an invitation to be known—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous arc from observation to crisis (preparing to cut Lindy) to decisive reconfiguration (releasing control and belonging). Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens—her nightly theorizing and repeated visits build toward the storm-night decision. Closure is strong: the new shoot and rearranged nursery concretize the internal shift with a visible before/after. The only limitation is that external stakes introduced (landlord, colleagues) do not re-enter the climactic sequence, leaving pressure almost entirely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: brooch → haunting image/dream → journal → conceptual explanation → exchange → altered morning. Causality holds at each link, and the closure (she relinquishes the brooch/art to gain a different relation with convergence and sleep) is on the page with visible cost. The shift from mystery to explained experiment via Elara’s journal skirts exposition but remains dramatically anchored in discovery. The drive lens (accumulative with causal beats) stays consistent through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clear and well-contained: pilgrim arrives, cave responds, pearl activates, unseen forces intensify, and a vision/realization resolves the tension. Causality holds cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure is a solid conceptual repricing of the unseen forces. The main weakness is the low sense of jeopardy or consequence beyond her reframed understanding, so the turns don’t fully bite. Still, the single-scene arc is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative and clean: we move from her return, through her information-gathering and patterning, to the institution of the new rite and its later legacy. Causality under this textural lens is coherent—listening yields data, data yields the “grief-map,” which earns the council’s assent, which reshapes communal practice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s relationship to absence is permanently altered, capped by the square’s valve and elders’ explanation. The main limitation is the absence of a discernible hinge scene where anything is genuinely in doubt; the council’s agreement feels assured before it happens, so the central turn is more ceremonial than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: entrance → following arrows → mirror descent → dare at the door → conceptual reveal and reconfiguration. Causality within the lyric frame is solid (cracks lead here; punch activates fissures; door yields whispers) and orientation never wavers despite the surreal spaces. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she discovers the “fortress” as a chorus to absorb, reinterprets the arrows as readiness, and steps into a new role, with the silver needle concretizing the before/after. Stakes are more thematic than situational, but for this length and mode, the single tightening around the door works.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: climb, contact with the tile, cascade of memories, whale-song synchrony, then the reframed understanding and archival act. Causality is coherent—each intensification (memories, then whales) leads naturally to Elira’s conceptual shift that the magic is “in the entanglement.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines the tile’s purpose and her own, and leaves a charged object and score for “the next one.” The main limitation is that the final turn, while elegant, doesn’t exact much on-page cost, so the before/after remains contemplative rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: present-moment ritual framed with compact backstory, escalating through storm, amulet activation, spatial mutiny, and the step into the farewell-plain. Causality holds (storm → magnetic peak → amulet “blossoming” → gateway), and the global drive reads as Accumulative with a causal spine. Closure is a clear conceptual shift: from seeking spectacle to revering the “quiet thunder” of endings, with the cost of abandoning his refuge and prior stasis. The only limitation is that no turn truly threatens failure or forces a tactical change; progress feels smooth and foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is clear: the child prepares, opens the ink, others arrive and use it, and by dawn the child exits with a new mission. Causality broadly holds (ink’s power → visitors’ recalibration → child’s strengthened purpose), and the closure—leaving to confront the father with the pen, not force—reads as a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration. Still, the dominant conflict with the father is deferred off-page, so the on-page decisive change feels conceptual rather than materially costly. The repeated rhetoric of “waiting actively” gives pattern but not a strong, escalating turn that tightens options in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: we move from her established routine, to the anomaly in the lamp’s hum, to the realization of other authors, and finally to her decision to invite further contributors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, but the before/after is legible and emotionally weighted—she relinquishes sole authorship of the archive. Causality within the chosen lyric-accumulative lens holds, with each new discovery logically deepening the premise instead of feeling like a bolt-on twist. Stakes remain largely conceptual/creative, which slightly limits felt urgency even as the structure is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: death certificate → port labyrinth → progressive catalog of fragments → final commitment. The drive lens (accumulative) is clear by the first third and held cleanly, and orientation (who/where/when) is never in doubt. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: Elias’s decision to continue layering against erasure, framed by the tide/world’s indifference, has conceptual cost. The main limitation is that there’s little sense of structural turning beyond deepening; the arc is elegant but low in dynamic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a single anchored scene with interleaved backstory, moving causally from ritual setup to intensified retelling, to the shell’s rupture, compass shattering, and a redefined quest. Closure is strong—a Conceptual Repricing and Earned Stasis where the “universal riddle” is reframed as her own silence, with the cost being relinquishing her explanatory pursuit. Causal links (retold argument → hum → compass pointing inward → realization → leaving) are coherent and legible. It doesn’t quite reach the very top band because escalation rests almost entirely on internal realization, with little external constraint complicating the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: small acts of covert reorganization, the scouts’ arrival, and the climactic citywide mural build toward a resonant community response. Causality holds under a textural lens—her encoded graffiti and quiet rerouting enable the final gathering and the stalling of privatization—without resorting to coincidence. Closure is solidly an RR/CR: the city reconfigures its stance (“THIS FLOATS TOGETHER”) and conceptually reprices privatization as negotiable rather than inevitable, with the cost of mere postponement on the page. The main limitation is that opposition remains abstract and offstage, softening the felt immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene under a ticking clock to 05:00, with the final grain’s fall and message release as the natural hinge. Causality is tight under an accumulative lens: climbing, examining, remembering, waiting, witnessing, then marking and leaving. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the mission’s meaning flips from archival duty to private communion—and cost is implicit in her solitude and in the artifact’s irretrievable, untranslated message. There are no orientation issues or dangling set-ups; everything seeded (the timing mechanism, the camera, the Archive) pays off conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: a broken drone threatens the orchids and voyage, Elara employs her method, and the successful repair enables departure and blooming orchids. Structure is linear, focused, and closure is present in the combined image of the activated drone, reacting flowers, and ship’s horn. However, there is essentially no genuine setback or uncertainty; once the premise is laid out, the process unfolds without structural surprise or risk. The ending feels earned but not hard-won, which limits impact at an elite-publication standard.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: falcon’s return → map scrutiny → condensation ritual → trek to lake → spiral in atlas, all clearly linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his quest reframed from mapping a place to recording a moment/relationship (“not a location to be marked, but a resonance to be felt”). Causality is legible and there are no orientation issues or broken rules. The main limitation is that the final attainment of the “singular convergence” feels almost frictionless—no serious jeopardy or setback on the way—so the cost component of closure is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very clean: arrival → tuning initiation → widening manifestations → town-wide resonance → quiet exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Virelle shifts from dead/forgotten to a charged equilibrium between living and lingering, with the bell tuner’s departure and the fork’s placement marking a clear before/after. Causality within the magical logic is consistent—her steps awaken layers of the town—but the sense of cost or narrowed options at the end is more conceptual than felt. Slightly higher stakes or a sharper articulation of what’s lost in “rebalancing” would push this into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: arrival at the temple → descent into the atrium → activation of the vial → sensory/memory onslaught → death and release, all in one continuous scene. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration: Elira’s choice transforms the temple’s hush from tomb-like silence to symphonic release, with her life as the price. Orientation (who/where/what she wants) is established early without confusion, and the “gathered hush” frame holds as the governing pattern to the end. No major setups are dropped, and the cost is explicitly on the page through the oxygen countdown and her immobility.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: he enters, acquires the lattice, alters the mechanism, summons and then entraps witnesses, and the search party arrives right on the “before they find the bodies” clock. The structure is tight and linear, with a clear closure unit: a conceptual and practical reconfiguration where the lighthouse is turned into a permanent carrier of unsilenced truth. Cost is evident—he trades his credibility and personal safety for that transformation—and the “boy who cried wolf” legacy is neatly inverted without strain. The drive lens reads as hybrid (causal spine with textural escalation) and holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural drive: the ghost bride tends trees → her backstory and debt are revealed → she appears to Elara → bead transfer triggers greenhouse awakening and redefinition of the curse. Causal linkages are legible and the closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with haunting transformed into inheritance and the orchard finally bearing fruit. The structure is cleanly single-threaded with one major tightening at the moment the bead changes hands, and there are no orientation or lens-ambiguity issues. The only limitation is that the story leans more on narrated history than on multiple present-time turns, so escalation feels more like a single crest than a series of pressured choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the labyrinth → preparation with plate and thread → sewing ritual → plate’s transformation and departure, all under a stable lyrical drive lens. Causality is coherent in a mythic register—her stitches produce environmental and magical responses leading to a clear closure beat where the object and world-state are reconfigured. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: mending becomes rule-breaking precedent for how endings work, with a before/after that’s legible and costly in implication if not overt peril.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—digging → recognizing the sundial’s displacement → reconstructing the circle → reorientation of time/faith—holds together cleanly, with a clear before/after at the restored dial. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s journey loops from diaspora back into rootedness, with the cost of leaving the wider world implied. Causality is soft but functional: each discovery unlocks the next layer of context rather than feeling random. The main limitation is the lack of any strong resistance or complicating turn; the path to restoration feels almost too unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is accumulative/lyric: we move from present ritual to philosophy to backstory to today’s specific mission, resolving in a credo-like closing image. Causality is clean at this modest scale—her history explains her method and today’s task flows logically from her ongoing work. Closure functions as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the final belief about the future reframes everything as resistance to digital speed. Still, there’s little sense of a before/after shift within this day; the story feels like a character study snapshot rather than a scene where options materially change.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: flame tremor → adjacent-layer reconnaissance → counter-tapestry sabotage → coup partially thwarted, with a clear before/after. The structure is essentially a single accumulating arc with one temporal jump to the coup, and closure lands solidly with the image of the steady flame and her exhausted sleep (Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid). Some major beats (the seizure of the observatory, the coup itself) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly reducing immediacy but not breaking logic. The dominant drive lens (causal with lyric texture) holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single scene that accumulates pressure: arrival with shard → messages in condensation → activation and surrender of the letters → disappearance and new droplets → new path revealed. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat deepens the central situation rather than turning it sharply, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she moves from circling apology to occupying the live “moment before deciding” now. Causality is consistent—her specific choices (tracing words, exposing letters to moonlight, placing them at the mangrove) clearly trigger the subsequent changes in the environment and messages. Cost at closure (loss of the letters and implied ongoing memory-tax) is on the page, though it could be edged into slightly sharper, more concrete consequence for elite-tier rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean single-scene lyric arc with clear anchors (who/where/when) and an accumulative drive: anesthetic → discovery of the cast → decryption → ritual-like contact between coral and cast → internal reconfiguration. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she exits having accepted the cost of carrying pain as kinship, with the coral’s role reweighted. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each move follows plausibly from the last. The only limitation for top-tier is that the “shifting” cast markings flirt with quasi-magical convenience, slightly weakening the hard-edged sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric mode: find fragment → seek context through elders → build optical scaffold → projection → internal revaluation. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening lines, and the orchard ruin serves as a stable stage. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she repockets the fragment “no longer a relic, but a key” and revises her forward drive. The only limitation is the relative gentleness of consequences—nothing in her outer life is truly foreclosed, so cost is primarily internal and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → failed attempts → discovery of reflected sound via the nickel → awakening experience → reconfigured state and garden. Causality holds throughout, and the closure is clear: the mural migrates into her and the garden reorients for the next visitor, a resonant reconfiguration with a legible before/after. The dominant drive is textural/experiential rather than suspenseful, but the progression is logical and satisfying. The main limitation is the modest narrative risk—no real threat of failure or rupture beyond mild identity destabilization.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: entry into the greenhouse, covert planting, Vex’s decision, communal uptake, and a forward-projected payoff with the gourd rattled at the Bureau. Causality holds—each step naturally follows from the previous one, and the late images of children and librarians feel like earned extrapolations rather than bolt-ons. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rebellion shifts from her private mission to a communal garden of defiance with clear ongoing risk. The main limitation is that obstacles remain mostly atmospheric; no beat forces a hard tactical pivot or near-failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story builds cleanly from routine (insomnia and singing into apparent silence) to a charged inflection when the postcard writes back (“They’re listening. Keep singing.”). Causality is mythic rather than literal but consistent: war → blossom armistice → her vow → centuries of singing → confirmation that her work matters. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses to continue exactly what she has been doing, but now with reweighted meaning and the cost of perpetual wakefulness made explicit. Structure is linear and legible with no orientation debt, though the escalation is quiet rather than sharply segmented.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a day-in-the-life frame that builds through the ritual mechanics of the chime, the museum’s rules, and the examples of failure, to a specific naming (Veyra) and a quiet descent. Causality and spatial orientation are clear very early; the world rules (no restoration, only preservation) are simple and consistently upheld. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reaffirms her covenant through a concrete act that briefly restores a nook’s self-knowledge, with the cost anchored in what she refuses to do. The main limitation is the lack of a sharper mid-story tightening or turn; the pressure deepens more in texture than in options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: discovery of musical law → reconstruction of vow → choral test → resonant outcome. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the Silence is reframed as betrayal, and the ending silence carries conceptual cost and hope. Stakes and world rules stay consistent, and there are no orientation or lens issues. The main limit is that we never see a genuine near-failure or misstep in the ritual, so cost remains largely conceptual rather than event-level.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: envelope → ash → amphitheater → harmonic discovery → decision to alter the gates, all tied causally and thematically. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing when she resolves to embed “encrypted compassion” in the systems and steps into the light, with a clear but understated cost via overseer disapproval and moral risk. The pressure, however, stays mostly conceptual; no single on-page beat forces an urgent, irreversible test of her choice, which keeps this just short of top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is tight: attic routine → meteorite discovery → experimental mapping → realization → harness redesign → song resurrection → external confirmation via the Reykjavik letter. The closure—her ceasing to forge new identities and letting the ledgers remain open—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. Causality is coherent and each escalation grows from the prior beat without arbitrary rule changes. The only slight limit is that the outcome unfolds with relatively little resistance once the meteorite’s function is discovered, softening structural tension at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece tracks cleanly from present-moment terrace to interleaved backstory and artifact-decoding, then to revelation and a decisive act. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens: bench → craftsman grief → father’s maze/keystone → logbook-consecration → recognition of her own handwriting → leap. Closure lands as both a decisive change (she steps through the “final threshold”) and a resonant reconfiguration of what thresholds and sacrifice mean. Cost is legible in her surrender of her anchor (the bench/Before) and her body to the maze-structure reality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: descent → observatory work → anomalous fireflies → threshold confirmation → ascent, all under a single contemplative drive. Causality is soft but coherent—the fireflies appear as a response to her tuned presence, and the feather’s vibration confirms the threshold, giving the encounter structural weight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves “alone again, but no longer lonely,” carrying the rhythm upward, which clearly marks a before/after. The cost is subtle (she accepts her liminal calling rather than simple escape), but it’s present enough for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: seeds → emotional transliteration → crater glass vision → conceptual shift about disappearance-as-gift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she abandons the drive to solve and embraces carrying and seeding the mystery forward. Causality within the lyric mode holds, and the before/after is legible, but the “before memory fades” clock and any real risk remain soft. The cost of her new stance is more implied than felt, which limits impact at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single continuous performance where each random intrusion is woven into the “orchestrated serendipity” pattern, leading to a quiet resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality is intentionally light, but the pattern of random event → Elias’s transformation → audience shift is consistent and legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of monotony/wonder, with Elias remaining in his chosen stasis-cathedral. The cost is subtle and mostly conceptual (a small, liminal life), which keeps this effective but not fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clear: exile → practice in solitude → discovery of the moonstone → ecstatic inscription dance → communal aftermath with villagers and a new role. Causality holds within an accumulative/textural lens: the moonstone discovery deepens her rebellion and triggers the climactic dance, which in turn draws the villagers. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the nostalgia ban’s power is reweighted by her embodied verse and the villagers’ arrival, with a clear before/after. Stakes and time (“third waning crescent since her exile,” dawn) track cleanly, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: arrival before dawn, ritual with prism and stone, interior framing, then departure with a new day’s task. Causality is simple but coherent—he performs his ritual, interprets its “messages,” then carries that stance into his choice to transform Widow Hargrove’s window. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing rather than a decisive turn, and it’s legible. The main limitation is the low sense of cost or narrowed options at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: walk → ritual with letters → personal addition → departure, all in one continuous scene with clean temporal and spatial anchors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: adding his own letter and walking on with the box “lighter” marks a before/after in how he holds pain. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, and the cost is legible. Escalation is modest rather than sharply turning, which keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: repeated cycles of create → launch → observe → recalibrate, culminating in the emerald balloon and resonance cascade. Causality is consistent within the established rules: her specific question about grief and the altered pattern lead to the obsidian disc and multiverse reconfiguration. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the world slightly lighter, her process ongoing but reweighted. The main limitation is that the “before/after” cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: entering corridor → sensing echoes → discovering diaries → reading and reconfiguring her role → leaving an offering. Causality is soft but coherent (her sensitivity leads her to the bend, which leads to the fireplace, which generates the core realization). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from extractor-mapper to co-dreamer and participant in legacy. Stakes are modest but legible throughout and the before/after line at the ending (“The walls dreamed. / And now, so would she.”) reads as a clear hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: terrace → parapet ritual → mirrors awakening → repriced ending as she dissolves and the world carries her work. Causality is coherent at a lyrical level (song→parapet→mirrors’ visions), and the pattern is taught early then paid off. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: after her act, the world and mirrors now hold “gentle fractures where light could enter,” and she relinquishes presence. The emotional cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, but the before/after is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → ritual inscription → arrival of survivors → collective signing, culminating in a resonant morning-after image. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: each step builds naturally from the prior one, and the closure (the imperfect mosaic of thumbprints) clearly reconfigures the situation with felt cost and possibility. There are no orientation issues; the who/where/when are anchored early. The main limitation is the lack of a strong mid-scene turn—pressure deepens more in theme and atmosphere than in concrete shifts of options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: arrival → ritual preparation → resonance event → departure, all causally and texturally linked under a single drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts ongoing ruthlessness while installing this act of echo-preservation as his private counterweight, with real conceptual cost. The accumulative, ritualistic build (map, egg placement, call, earth’s response) escalates smoothly without feeling mechanical. There are no orientation or causality slips, though stakes remain exclusively internal and aesthetic rather than directly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival, engagement with the prism, progressive untangling, then a final resistant knot and release of echoes. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each thread yields a different echo, building toward the sanctuary’s opening. Closure lands as a clear reconfiguration of the world’s soundscape and her role in it, though the concrete risks of failure or success remain abstract. The piece teaches its pattern early and stays within one continuous, legible scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clear: present-tense rehearsal in the dome framed by a causally linked backstory of argument → exile → puppet shows → new ethic. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he commits to return with a show instead of an apology, reframing repair as accountable art rather than placation. Causality is intact and easy to trace, and the reflection interleaves cleanly with concrete present anchors (stick, candle, dome). The main ceiling is that the present scene has low on-page jeopardy; the decisive “turn” is more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: arrival → construction → stillness peak → departure, with the ritual as spine and a clear closure in the charged final image. Causality is soft but consistent—each step follows from her method and ethos, and the last monarch’s descent reads as a resonant micro-turn rather than a contrivance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the honoring is complete, the signal sent “backward,” and her purpose re-situated in the unseen. The structure is quiet but clean, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: arrival in the sanctum → methodical ritual with rope/card/wax → three-day wait → unveiling and activation of the helix → departure, with a clear before/after in how memory is held. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world now has a device that embeds the nameless dead in ongoing, participatory ritual, and the narrator walks away with options and identity reweighted. Causality is soft but coherent—each tool and action has a clear “because/therefore”—and there are no orientation lapses or broken rules. The main limit is that tension in the present moment never tightens into a real risk or obstacle; process unfolds without significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous episode with a stable POV where each move (descent, contact via dream, realization, extraction of the seal, collapse) flows logically under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Elara’s relationship to time and agency is reconfigured, as is the bunker’s relation to the forest. The because/therefore chain is soft but present (her dream-method triggers the directive’s release, which triggers seal removal and bunker collapse). The main limitation is the relatively low felt cost: the price of this insight remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single ritualized scene that accumulates detail until the tile activates, followed by a quiet denouement as he departs. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the escalation of schematics and the approach of Sirius to the horizon culminate in a clear closure beat (“Confirmed.” and his departure). Causality is simple but intact: his preparations lead to the hum, which reconfigures the covenant from hoped-for to confirmed at conceptual cost. The main limitation is that, beyond this confirmation, the scene’s stakes and options never meaningfully narrow, making the structural arc solid rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: she enters with a broken tool and a longstanding problem, attempts a nonverbal, body-based solution, and arrives at a reconfigured state where the mechanism’s role has changed. Causality is clear under a textural lens—focusing on the pin and re-framing it as pivot precedes the internal chime and emotional drop. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the melody’s migration and the broken box’s new function for others provide a before/after with conceptual cost. Stakes remain mostly interior and philosophical, but they are consistent and satisfy the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation in the ruined orchard, ritual intensification via breath and sextant shards, arrival and capture of the dream, then re-thickening fog. Causality holds—each step (trading for sextant, arranging shards, breathing pattern) leads to the dream’s appearance and containment. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rules have been subtly reset by her final mirror. The cost and before/after are more conceptual than visceral, keeping this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: gathering vows, locating the daughter’s vow, coaxing it down, then the off-page visit and green scrap that reconfigure the situation. Causality holds—her exile after the Guild breach leads to the cathedral, which enables the vow work that in turn nudges the daughter back. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the relationship is still estranged, but options have clearly shifted and her stance crystallizes. The only limitation is that escalation feels more like a steady lyrical deepening than a true tightening of options, which keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—orchard → bathroom epiphany → re-emergence into a changed orchard—reads as a clean accumulative arc with a clear before/after. Causality under a textural lens holds: her inquiry in the bathroom leads to the glyph, the cameo opening, and reconfigured perception. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“between the first and last page…a field to be harvested”) with a tangible internal cost. Stakes remain primarily intellectual/spiritual, so the sense of risk never tightens beyond contemplative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: Elira arrives with a clear goal, finds Kael and the fractured chrono-core, reframes the mission, and reaches a conceptual closure where the lexicon’s lesson repairs the situation. Causality is coherent (her prior research → recognition of “gaps” → new tactic → mountain’s realignment), and the scene holds to a single arc without orientation issues. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “rescue,” with the world-state visibly altered (mountain settles, core harmonizes), though the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with a thematic, textural ending) and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: movement from prow → interior → engine room → garden maps directly onto deepening memory/identity stakes. Causality is clear and motivated (the card guiding her, the valve opening the staircase), and the drive lens holds as textural build toward a single choice. Closure is strong: taking *Lirien* constitutes a decisive change and reconfigures her stance on selfhood with visible cost (risk of fracture) acknowledged on the page. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity; the ending’s slight fog-thinning ties world-state to her internal turn without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: anomaly → investigation → ritual repair → recalibrated tower, with the vanishing door as a satisfying closure image. Causality holds at each step, and the story reads as an accumulative/textural build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration of the space and system. The cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatic—her choice succeeds without notable risk—which keeps the arc intellectually satisfying but emotionally mild. Still, the before/after in the tower and its timekeeping is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: introduction of the invaded caves, her method with the ice and stone, the bloom of hush, and the pacification of the central being leading into departure. Causality is intact and legible under a textural/causal hybrid lens (her specific acts produce progressively larger zones of quiet). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the caves shift from screaming to tuned, and she moves on to the “next silence.” The cost at closure is more implied (pressure, release, melting ice) than sharply dramatized, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → setup of ritual → star alignment → visions → Cassiopeia’s deepening → self-revelation and departure, all in one coherent scene. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural—each step thickens the pattern of echoes until the conceptual shift (“receiver,” “summoned”) at closure, a resonant reconfiguration with a legible cost (ongoing burden of listening, fragile rekindling). Causality is intact and clear; every step grows from prior setup (star paths, prism’s properties, pavilion’s hum). Stakes are almost entirely internal and there’s minimal jeopardy of real failure, which slightly softens the sense of structural “snap” at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: ascent → observation/decoding → reconfiguration of her relation to memory → descent with internalized hush. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses not to look back and carries the archive within, reframing the stormlit observatory as altar and herself as future artefact. Causality is soft but consistent—each new monument/shadow reading deepens the premise rather than feeling random. Stakes remain conceptual, not situationally urgent, but within a lyric mode the arc feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: walk to the heart of the fortress, decode the mosaic, trigger a transformation in the sky, then relinquish the talisman and leave. Causality is sound under an accumulative/textural lens—each sensory and ritual step builds toward the chord and star-break, and the closure beat (leaving the rag, fortress sealing) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with legible emotional cost. Stakes stay focused on reclaiming light/hope through this ritual; there are no dropped threads or confusing jumps. The only constraint on a higher score is that pressure and options remain relatively simple, with little sense she might fail or choose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean single-scene, accumulative lyric design: sensation → ritual (cicada) → impressionistic “visions” → relational beat → conceptual reframing. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where “time” is repriced as attention to thresholds, with the relationship held in a charged poise. Causality is soft but coherent (she comes to the grotto with an aim, enacts her method, gains a reframed stance), and there are no orientation issues. The cost—choosing presence in uncertainty over decision—is legible but understated, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: bunker constraint → gravity inversion → ascent to trellis → reconfigured stance in the garden. Causality is simple but legible, and the closure (choosing a new locus of silence and letting go of fear) reads clearly as a before/after reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The gravity inversion is an unmotivated miracle that functions as a situational inciting event rather than an earned turn, but within the fabulist frame it doesn’t break logic. Stakes and options narrow modestly with the one-hour window and the visible alternative (hatch yawning below), but that temporal pressure is not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single transit with an accumulative/textural drive: we move from embarkation through emotional modulation to a quiet closure and reset. Causality is soft but coherent—his choices with the storm glass and environment gradually shift her state, leading to on-page before/after in her body and behavior. The closure (his readiness to continue with the next, very different passenger) reconfigures the premise into an ongoing vocation with emotional cost. Nothing crucial is left dangling, and there are no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: waterfall → orchard → murals → coordinates → hatch → stairway → throne → temporal reset, with each step motivated and legible. The sunrise deadline and the orchard’s collapsing reality provide a clear structural tightening, and the stairway tremor midway nicely signals escalation. Closure is strong: she sits on the throne, experiences a conceptual repricing of “ascension,” chooses a self, and emerges into a subtly altered timeline with the orchard gone. Cost is present but more conceptual than visceral, which suits the piece but slightly limits its punch.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds cleanly from arrival at the sanctuary through the charged threshold to the lantern-field and release of the knocker, with no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the shift from sealed sanctuary to open expanse and from begging to anointing “mourner and midwife” clearly marks a before/after with emotional cost. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical but consistent: scars → threshold response → dissolution → field of lanterns. The only limitation is that some middle moves feel like variations on one emotional state rather than distinct structural turns.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: backstory and present stakes braid into a single causal arc—glitchy texts → decision to play along → convergence ritual → transformed farm and renewed commitment. The drive lens reads primarily causal, with an accumulative lyric overlay; cause-and-effect is consistent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “quantum promise” is redefined and Elara’s role in the system shifts from mark to ethical mediator, with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that the mechanics of the threshold (why this object, this night) remain more mythic than fully dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of structural inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: she comes to the reading room with a mission, prepares herself via her learned method, plays the cylinder, receives a destabilizing revelation, and chooses a new course (toward the clocktower). Closure lands as a decisive change in self-concept and mission, with a clear before/after: from presumed usurper to rightful heir. The cost is conceptual and emotional—her identity and role invert, with implied political consequences—rather than concretely dramatized, but it is legible on the page. The reflective block about caves and standing waves briefly slows forward motion yet remains anchored enough in the present to support the method rather than fracture structure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: knight enters with a goal, engages with the marionette program, performs the patterns, reality reshapes, and he emerges transformed. Causality within a lyric/accumulative lens is coherent—each escalation in movement and environmental response leads logically to the threads and the final reconfiguration. Closure is strong: he shifts from armored isolation to walking as a conduit with possibility, a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The only limitation is that the external stakes and constraints remain abstract, keeping the drive largely interior and aesthetic rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the button → investigation and dust-reading → reframe of her role → institutional acknowledgment via the supervisor. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when she opens the “Magnifications” log and explicitly alters how files will be read. Causality is modest but coherent; each step logically follows from the last without teleports or unresolved set-ups. Stakes are internal and institutional rather than plot-driven, but the before/after is legible with a felt cost in her ongoing sorrow redirected rather than erased.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and easy to follow: puddle-map → hatch → Engine → broadcast → regime response. Closure is solid—a clear before/after in the world’s information regime, with conceptual and situational cost in the blackout and approaching enforcers. The main structural weakness is the convenience of her escape, summarized in “she was already gone,” which sidesteps the most pressurized moment. Overall, the piece adheres well to a causal drive lens with an on-page reconfiguration of the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from establishing the ritual to intensifying resistance to the prism’s shattering and the hush’s success. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/ritual lens: he plays, the grotto responds, the prophecy resists, and the prism’s dissolution marks closure with the prophecy’s erasure. The cost—erasing something vast and dangerous with no witness—lands conceptually and emotionally through the quiet, uncelebrated exit and the final dewdrop image. There are no orientation issues, and the closure beat reads as a decisive change with a resonant after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: Elira’s seed-sorting expands into memory-summoning, then into a communal sanctuary, and this builds coherently. The key causal turns—prodding the speck, realizing the arbor “stitches memory into matter,” altering the monuments, and the grandmother’s emergence—are clearly linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the arbor’s prophecy reframed as ever-unfolding past and Elira’s vocation enlarged into a public liturgy. Stakes remain primarily conceptual and spiritual, but the before/after in her role and the arbor’s purpose is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: coincidences → compass arrival → investigation → greenhouse portal → cavern revelation → changed vocation. The story lands a clear Conceptual Repricing: certainty as danger rather than virtue, paid for by relinquishing his watch and old identity. Structure is essentially two shards (surface life/cavern transformation) with a brief coda, all coherent and well-paced. A minor limitation is that the latter part compresses consequential time (“weeks or months later”) into summary rather than on-page turns.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece runs as a single accumulative ritual scene where each step (setting up, invoking names, coin cracking, shattering) tightens toward an interior reconfiguration. Causality is clean under a textural lens: the more intention and names she feeds into the coin, the more it fractures until it dissolves and reweights her relation to guilt. Closure is strong: she leaves with a new stance, a vial of dust, and the coin’s sacrifice as cost. Structure is elegant, though largely straight-line without any major structural surprise beyond the coin’s destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene accumulative structure: arrival at the gorge, attunement, playing the flute, confessions, laughter, release, and departure. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each move (listening, playing, ghosts emerging, laughter) builds on the last rather than reading as a collage. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the gorge’s soundscape and her tool are altered, and her ongoing task is reweighted by the newly reclaimed laughter. Cost is present but subtle—her fullness and “tender bruise” imply emotional burden rather than a stark forking choice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: anesthesia wearing off → forest responding to pain → mathematical Q&A memory → path opening → symbolic offering of the strap → conceptual repricing of mercy. Causality is clear within the lyric frame (answering the derivative question opens the path; offering the strap seals the reconfiguration), and orientation is never in doubt. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing with cost: relinquishing the mask-strap-as-identity tether in exchange for inhabiting a new stance. The only modest limitation is that external stakes remain mostly implicit, keeping the pressure primarily interior.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: need → market → obtain lens (at a real cost) → use on triptych → historian’s encounter → return of artifact and new commission. The accumulative/textural drive is well-handled: each stage deepens the central concern of recovering erased histories, and the climax with the historian offers clear on-page closure (his recognition and weeping, the lens dimming). The cost (surrendering a cherished memory, emotional labor of mediation) is legible if understated. Structure is tight and linear despite lyricism, with no orientation issues or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean single scene with a clear through-line: arrive, investigate, locate the focal point in the ceiling, reveal, witness, depart. Causality within an accumulative/textural lens holds: each observation of dust and neglect leads plausibly to the ceiling tile and then to the apparition and ritual of collection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the building is “keeping vigil” and he accepts his role as witness—with a legible before/after in the ghosts’ “lighter” presence. The main limitation is that stakes and options never visibly constrict; the piece relies more on mood than on any hard structural tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: reality’s negotiability and the bottled whisper are established, the rupture is triggered, the aperture appears, and she makes a specific, consequential choice. Causality is strong under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—each surreal escalation flows logically from prior rules. Closure is robust: she succeeds in compressing eternity and permanently alters the library’s systems, with conceptual and systemic cost clearly on the page. The only limitation is that the central “stakes test” happens almost frictionlessly, with little sense that failure or refusal was truly live.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural arc: solitary mourning → experimental decoding → storm discovery → institutional challenge via Voss → joint transcription and repricing of what “revolution” means. Causality is soft but coherent (chrono-winds reveal a pattern; covering mirrors stabilizes it; Voss’s data validates it), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on-page cost (he relinquishes the old war as his defining frame). The arrival of Voss is a bit convenient and off-stage, but it doesn’t break the throughline. The final haiku and dawn image make the before/after legible without over-explaining the mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene (with one brief backstory inset) moves from receipt of the chip through test, setback (wilting), insight, experiment with song, and transformative closure. Causality is strong—each development (stone wilting, chamber’s response, dancer’s awakening) arises logically from the last under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands solidly via resonant reconfiguration: he redefines the covenant of rust and his own vocation with visible emotional cost (carrying the song and his honesty henceforth). The only slight limit is how smoothly the solution arrives once he chooses to sing; there’s little sense of real risk of failure after that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: factory closes → descent → lagoon → compass reading → Riel’s revelation → Elira’s choice to go inward. The inferred drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with one clear tightening when the compass’s true function and Riel’s fate are revealed. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—Elira reframes “being lost” as belonging—but the concrete cost of sealing herself away from the surface remains more conceptual than dramatically tested. Structure is elegant and coherent, but the lack of on-page friction keeps it just below elite-tier immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: GPS failure and storm → discovery/activation of the slide → carving and projection → communal adoption, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “navigation” as alliance. Causality is soft but legible—each beat grows organically from the prior one, and the ending’s living-archive motif feels like a natural extension rather than a bolt-on. Closure is strong: the before/after is clear as the village shifts from tech-reliant panic to ritualized collective response, with Elara’s new role crystallized. External stakes remain relatively low-key, but they suit the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: pavilion → journey across thawing winter → cathedral investigation → return and transformed practice, all under a single POV and through-line of inquiry. Causality is soft but coherent (postcard anomaly → travel → discovery in glass → reimagined mural), appropriate to an accumulative/lyric drive lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she continues the same outward behaviors, but now consciously “surrenders” rather than “solves,” with a felt emotional cost. No major orientation issues or causality breaks; the only limit is relatively low external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: attempts to communicate with the lagoon build from failure to phosphorescent response to her permanent binding as archive. Causality within that mode is coherent—discover diary → failed solo ritual → recognition that land demands parley → debris liturgy → lagoon revelation → reconfigured life. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts retrocognitive entrapment as ongoing cost, and the library becomes conduit rather than repository. Stakes and price are legible at the end (loss of a “normal” life, endless witnessing), though the transitions between several late-stage developments are summarized rather than scene-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: drained town → alchemist’s bottled working memory → transfer to child → spontaneous lanterns → communal participation → reweighted final image. Causality is intentionally soft around mechanism, but under a textural lens the pattern of lanterns emerging in response to shared “unspoken stories” functions as a coherent escalation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s drive shifts from consumption of wishes to collective becoming, with the bottle’s ownership and meaning recast. Stakes and cost (loss of old life, abandonment of wish-economy) are present but could be pointed more through one sharp, concrete on-page loss or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—present in the orchard, immersion into the field-trip cylinder, prophetic revelation, then activation—reads cleanly and causally under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Elira reframes her role and initiates “Cycle One,” with the petals altering the city in a small but concrete way. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and the cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is legible. Orientation is strong throughout; the time jump is clearly cued by the memory ritual and returns crisply to the present.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story operates on an accumulative/textural lens: find the hatched “silence,” touch the acorn cap, walk to the dais, perform the ritual, and transform the atrium. Causality is clean enough—each step is a motivated next move, and closure is a resonant reconfiguration (frozen death → living, time-rich atrium). The cost is conceptual/emotional (letting go, consenting to a different configuration of time) rather than dramatized as a hard sacrifice, which keeps the arc powerful but not searing. Structure is coherent, single-scene, and lands its final beat without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: ascent, system-building, storm’s approach, near-trigger, then the true toll. Causality is coherent—her installed sensors and conditions directly produce the bell’s ringing—and the Great False Dawn backstory efficiently charges present choices. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the valley’s relationship to alarm has changed, and trust is conceptually restored. The cost (risk of panic or silence) is more implied than dramatized, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: quiet routine → remembered past → anomalous comet → efflorescent dissolution → return to sweeping with a reweighted stillness. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the rogue comet is a focused escalation that crystallizes what he’s been practicing. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he resumes the same action, but the universe’s “exhale” and his tears underscore an altered weight to his vocation. The cost—choosing obscurity and unrecorded reverence over recognition—is legible if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: one continuous situation that deepens via images of ghosts, covenant, and the box, culminating in the beekeeper’s ghost finally meeting her gaze. Orientation is clean, and the drive lens holds. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s gratitude reweights her vigil and the covenant’s cost, crystallized in the final image of honey-gold glyphs. The lack of a sharper mid-story turn or test on the covenant keeps the arc from feeling fully peak-ready for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: unearthed capsule → coded listings → Lira’s response → capsule activation → letter → urn fusion → new vocation. Orientation is strong from the first line (emerald silo, salt flats, Vey inside), and the world rules around time and numbers hold consistently. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with concrete on-page change: Vey’s heartbeat regularizes and their role redefines from measuring to curating. The cost—years of dislocation and the burden of carrying others’ “echoes”—is implied but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: kite snaps → Elira chooses to tend → reweaving → launch → quiet closure, all under a single continuous scene. The accumulative, lyric drive remains coherent, and the closure beat (a different kite flying and Elira’s emptied hands) lands with a clear before/after. Causality is simple but solid; no unkept set-ups or plot amnesia. The cost is modest (accepting loss rather than “fixing”), which keeps the stakes from feeling fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure—from diagnosis through remodeling to death and legacy—is coherent and satisfying, with a clear before/after centered on the orchard as monument. Causality is clean: his diagnosis leads to the project, which produces the Whisper Arch, Spiral Stair, and ultimately the folk-legend afterlife of his work. Closure is strong and legible: his death under the pillars and the later generations inhabiting his designs create a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. The main limitation is that much of the middle is summarized rather than scened, so some turns feel more narrated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: approach → ascent → failed measurement → reframing → departure. Causality and drive are clear under a textural lens: because her data do not match her hypothesis, she is forced into a conceptual repricing where “chemistry” shifts from the external environment to convergence itself. Closure lands with cost: she leaves the amber behind and relinquishes an old epistemology. The single-scene arc is coherent, with no orientation or lens ambiguity debt.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: arrival → listening/negotiation with birds → planting ritual → charged departure. Causality is soft but legible (he must gain “permission” and concord before fertilizing), and the closure beat—him leaving yet oriented toward the sown patches—reconfigures the opening stasis with a sense of ongoing, costly work. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the first sentence, and there are no causality breaks. The main limit is the low variance in on-page options; his path never really risks shifting, so the change is more in depth than in circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: scrapyard status quo → cylinder discovery → handler’s voice as catalytic revelation → eastward journey → archive of cylinders → settled new role. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the closure (Bracken’s new vocation and the community’s nightly gatherings) lands as a genuine reconfiguration with cost implicit in the labor and the scale of loss. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the ending honors that through the resonance of repeated listening rather than a single decisive act. The one limitation is that obstacles are almost entirely elided—the trip east and access to the bunker feel frictionless, which slightly softens the sense of earned culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean single-scene, accumulative lyric where each return to ritual, compass, and sky builds toward the filament’s appearance. Causality is soft but coherent: shutdown → her decision to stay → sketching as practice → capacity to perceive and record the anomaly → reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the same silence that was oppressive becomes “companionable,” and witnessing seems to alter the anomaly. Stakes remain largely internal and reflective, which keeps the piece from feeling structurally bolder.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: wrong sky → climb spire → map command → swapping pieces → awakened game → sky’s reconfiguration, all in one continuous scene. Closure lands as a decisive change with global consequence and a conceptual repricing—the world is not “fixed” but invited to play—which is clear and earned. Cost is more conceptual than felt, tied to retiring ancient truths in favor of new ones, which slightly softens the impact. Structurally it’s elegant and contained, though a touch frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is controlled: walking → others joining → widow’s unbinding → sovereign’s arrival, all building toward the closure where the narrator confronts power with the word “listen.” Causality is thematic rather than event-driven, but consistent: the gallery’s practice attracts survivors, thickens the penumbra, and sets up the sovereign’s destabilizing encounter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the meaning of sovereignty and history shifts in that final tableau, with a conceptual cost for the new ruler. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ritual preparation → activation of feather/stone → architectural response → passage into the new room → laying down the stone, with each step coherently following the last. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from translator of others to someone who belongs, and the stone’s purpose ends. Causality is more ritual-mystical than mechanical, but the pattern is taught early (her past use of the stone) and paid off with the sanctuary’s emergence. The cost—relinquishing her prior role and accepting a new, anchored self—is legible, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → descent into labyrinth → tapestry work → mirror confrontation → re-emergence, all under a coherent Accumulative/Textural drive. Each phase causally follows the last, with the winnowing of threads leading organically to the mirror’s reframing of her guilt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she accepts continued exile while reweighting its meaning, and the restarting village externalizes that internal shift. Stakes and cost are legible, though escalation is more contemplative than sharply turned, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure—repeated sessions, the child’s visit, her self-focused final session—builds cleanly to the ritual deadline. Causality is coherent: her sessions affect the spire, her dream clarifies the ritual’s demand, her final refusal triggers the spire’s dissolution. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the world’s ritual logic (singular truth) gives way to refraction with a visible consequence (spire dissolves). The emotional and social cost of her defiance is only lightly sketched, not fully pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story uses a clean accumulative structure: each narrated scar deepens the ritual and tightens both emotional and environmental pressure (fumes, sinking workshop). Causality is coherent—her specific acts of narration and lacquer application lead to the statue’s recognition and the workshop’s transformation from raft to altar. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward her own brokenness and the space she inhabits is decisively reweighted at cost (she must re-open her most painful memories under lethal conditions). The drive lens stays stable throughout, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: harbor → cave journey → interior ritual → return, with each stage deepening the central drive rather than wandering. Causality under a textural/accumulative lens is strong: the mirror crack prompts the return to the cave, the painting act leads to a felt reconfiguration, and the exit/return to the quay closes the loop with altered stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses to continue painting as covenant without dependence on reflective objects—and the before/after is legible. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but they are consistently framed and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece is structurally clean: a single continuous scene with clear orientation and a causal chain from cork use to ships correcting course to Elara’s reconfigured sense of duty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with Elara’s role reframed from purely mechanical keeper to custodian of an “unshouted frequency.” The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and that pattern holds. The main limitation is that the cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, which keeps the ending just shy of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates cleanly under an accumulative/textural drive: images of calling, static, lunar fluctuation, and reverse migration layer toward the final redefinition of “abandonment” as “recalibration.” Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and never slips, and the pattern of midnight calls and lunar phases teaches itself firmly. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s abandonment is reweighted into a costly, ongoing discipline of raw, non-comforting solace. The main limitation is that structural escalation is gentle rather than sharply tightening; the stakes deepen more conceptually than situationally.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly linear and accumulative: from foraging to encounter to relinquishing the relic, each beat grows out of the last with clear because/therefore linkages. Closure is strong as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she moves from relying on the eye to giving it up and walking forward with unoccluded truth, with an on-page cost. The global drive lens (accumulative/textural with situational pressure) holds consistently. The middle relies more on atmospheric thickening than on sharp turns, but this suits the chosen lens and doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clear: a present-time ritual at the dock, an internal “investigation” via the flower, a memory shard, then the desk/lighthouse coda that reweights everything. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated twilight walks and the delayed “gap speaking” on the fourth night give a satisfying tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Silas accepts the role of keeper of this secret rather than informer, which redefines the premise of his work. The only thing holding this short of the very top band is that the global stakes and consequences remain relatively small and interior, never quite testing his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: chip discovery → anomalous glimmer/ants → hidden door → cavern/archway → transformed shop with letter → decision to depart. The piece maintains a single, legible drive about reaching and using the “doorway of decisions,” and the closure—world inverted, new coordinates, shop locked—lands as a genuine before/after shift with cost. The only mild softness is how conveniently the letter provides exact future-dated coordinates, but within the established magical logic this feels earned rather than patchy. Structure fits the length well with one clear escalation spine and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine—ignored warnings → recurring dreams → climb → grotto revelation → mandate to return changed—under an accumulative/lyric lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the backstory flashes (child, Bardic Guild, edict) are anchored to present stimuli and reweight current stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses the path of remaining a withdrawn, self-justifying queen and accepts a costlier, more vulnerable role. The late reveal of the child being “released” via portal is dense but still legible within the world’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is tight: one continuous scene at a single locus, with clear temporal flow from poised anticipation to confession to ritual response. Causality is intact—his admission deepens the nexus’s reaction, triggers her alchemical act, and yields a resonant closure image. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the ending provides a solid resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard decisive change. Stakes stay intimate and contained, so while closure works, the structural arc feels modest rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: grave → retreat to cabin → resistance of the scroll → appearances of past selves → active hunting → completed scroll → re-encountering the grave with reweighted meaning. Causality is lyric but coherent—past selves trigger writing, which fills the scroll and leads to the reframed stance at the trailhead. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: chaos persists but now has “a shape. / And a name. / Mine,” with the grave demoted from verdict to footnote. Escalation is more deepening than narrowing options, but it’s sufficient at this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: Elara arrives seeking revelation, offers the screw, receives a reframe, commissions its mounting, and leaves with a transformed tool that reorients her practice. Causality is intact and legible, and the piece follows an accumulative/textural drive where conversation and object-handling steadily reweight her loss. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts that her work is about witnessing rather than scent, with cost tied to enduring anosmia and the fraud feeling that won’t fully vanish. The arc is quiet but coherent; a touch more on-page resistance or choice under friction could have made the turn feel less linear.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual framed by the world's held breath, progressing through the runes to a clear closure when the world exhales. Causality is sound—past failure leads to present fear; stress causes ink to crystallize; revisiting superstition changes her tactic and keeps the ink liquid, which in turn enables the emotional reconfiguration. The closure (conceptual repricing of scars via the completed ritual) lands decisively with on-page cost (pain remains, but meaning changes). It’s a quiet, accumulative design but fully coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: she arrives with a goal, escalates via the perfume and induced currents, adds the restored manuscript, and exits on a reconfigured relationship and unchanged orchard fate. Causality holds under a Hybrid (causal/textural) lens, and the closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: they move from estranged to tenuously reconnected at real cost. No orientation debt; stakes and sequence are legible start to finish. The only limitation is that the off-page orchard threat is more atmospheric than structurally active, so the ticking clock doesn’t fully tighten choices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative, one-scene structure is coherent: arrival → selection of volumes → axiom spoken → surrender → dissolution/merger, with the “universe hiccups” and library reconfigurations marking clear stages. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong early; the lyricism never obscures basic situation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when she ceases to distinguish seeker and sought and becomes “the hush after,” with the cost being the loss of her distinct witness-self. Causality is soft but consistent for an accumulative/textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: whistle → backward count → key insertion → station shudder → brief “held” moment → reinterpreted understanding at the end. Causality is clear enough under a lyric lens, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing (clocks as absence/surrender) grounded in the ritual we’ve watched. There’s no big external turn, but the rhythm of the ritual and the station’s mechanical responses provide a satisfying arc. The before/after in his conception of clocks is subtle but legible and costs him a surrender to permanent solitude and oddity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: Aris’s intention, the keyed object, and the stranger sharpen into the single act of pressing the button and allowing dissolution. Causality is legible—her gift and the mushrooms’ function are established before the resonance and the stranger’s dispersal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reclassifies the button from relic to key and her role from guarding barriers to honoring departures, with the cost of relinquishing the familiar stranger. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: rainwashed library → backstory and subway scrawls → hospital visit → return to library, all oriented cleanly with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing in “Begin again,” clearly reweighting her stance on risk and responsibility, with the father’s clover as cost-laden evidence of mutual change. Stakes are internal but legible: how she will live with inherited compulsions and new responsibility. The only minor limitation is that external pressures remain soft, so the structural arc leans heavily on reflection instead of concrete tests.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/mosaic structure is coherent: a pattern of misrouted calls is established, varied with examples, and then tightened by the anomalous self-call that reconfigures the premise. Causality is clear within the chosen lens—her ongoing practice leads to the possibility and meaning of that final move. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she applies her method to herself, rewriting “endings” to include her own erasure into the system. Stakes stay largely conceptual, but the before/after is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one scene, one focalizer, present action continuously braided with reflection, culminating in a charged final image. The closure—her choice to keep returning, regenerating the covenant through ordinary acts—is clear and felt as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise rather than a decisive external change. Causality is soft but coherent, with the locket and the jetty catalyzing the decision to articulate the covenant clauses. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, which works for the mode but caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure—story trades building toward the focused exchange with the moth-eaten-coat man—holds cleanly, with no orientation issues. Causality is soft but coherent: she creates a ritual space, rumors propagate, which brings in increasingly vulnerable participants, culminating in mutual confession. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s meaning is reweighted from abandonment to charged communal site, with emotional cost paid in the final story exchange. Nothing essential is set up and then dropped; the “when the story changes” line is paid off explicitly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure—a pilgrimage deeper into the forest toward the stillpoint—remains legible and coherent, with no orientation issues. Each beat (notes intensifying, memories surfacing, ring warming, arrival at the silent sphere) feels like a “because/therefore” escalation under the chosen lens. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she surrenders the tool that defined her and redefines mapping as composition rather than absorption. The only limitation is that temporal pressure from the constellation “pause” is more mythic than actively dramatized as a live clock.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrive at the anomaly with a problem, experiment with the pen, enact revisions, and leave with a reframed understanding of her past “seeds.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing and mild Earned Stasis: she accepts uncertainty and reinterprets her failure (“wrong tense”) rather than “fixing” it. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens remains coherent—the anomaly and pen produce concrete effects—but the narrative cost of her actions remains rather abstract, limiting the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: Elara’s performance builds, the fisherman’s pause hints at impact, and the true tightening arrives with the girl asking “Show me,” which re-aims the entire scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with Elara’s mission concretized in the girl and Silas’s line about forgetting reweighting the premise. Causality is straightforward—her actions attract observers, then one becomes a participant—without gaps or contrivance. The cost (creating unrecorded art in a world that forgets you) is legible at the end, even if largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: tapestry → trail of art → archive response → final chamber, with a legible before/after in her role and in the awakened archive (a clear CR/RR closure). Causality is mostly clean, though the archive’s cooperation (“They had known she would come,” doors opening, glyphs glowing) makes the journey feel more like ordained unveiling than pressured problem-solving. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, centered on her acceptance of a criminalized identity in the surface world. The pattern holds under an accumulative/textural lens, but the turns could feel sharper and less foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: we move from stillness on the lagoon rim through escalating sensory and psychic activation to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality is soft but legible—she rejects prescribed rest, chooses drumming, the garden responds, and a new shared self emerges. Closure is clear and on the page: she ends in an earned stasis where wholeness coexists with the ongoing burden. Stakes and cost are largely internal, but the before/after line is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → noise disruption → discovery of coin → map → keyhole → overheard confession → quiet handoff to Ruiz. The closure—a conceptual repricing that redefines “the key” as opening ears rather than doors—is legible and satisfying. Still, the global drive never tightens into a true dilemma; once the tools appear, the path to outing Delgado is smooth. The cost of her chosen tactic remains mostly conceptual, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense vigil, one well-anchored flashback (the boy from Bridge Seven), and a single on-page encounter that tightens into closure with the star’s descent. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece layers rules (mirror, shutters, glyphs) and rumor (threshold between drowning and deciding) toward a charged final image that clearly reweights the premise. Causality is soft but coherent—her methods lead to the drowned woman’s shift in stance—and there is a legible before/after in the canal’s relationship to light. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it is present in her ongoing, necessary watch.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (library → prior window campaign → test in annex → midnight escalation → town reactions → quiet morning after) is clear and satisfying under a textural lens. Causality of the magic is simple but consistent: grotto hums → light warps → trees appear → people entertain “second thoughts.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the grotto now openly humming beneath the table and the “forest” continuing to grow. The main limitation is that nothing ever truly obstructs her plan; pressure is low even as the spectacle scales up.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: docks → wading → whale call → island → return, with each beat deepening commitment and revelation. The causal chain around the scrimshaw heating, the whale’s summons, and the island’s surfacing is coherent within the story’s rules, and the disappearance at dawn provides a contained arc. Closure is strong: the experience reconfigures Lira’s role on the docks, and her new stance directly shapes the final interactions. The only minor limitation is that external stakes remain mostly abstract (no direct on-page risk of refusal beyond missing the opportunity), keeping the pressure primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → low-pressure whittling and self-narration → compliance visits → deliberate construction of the “Permitted” box → public performance and return to the old pattern with a reweighted final image. Causality is solid under a situational/accumulative lens; each new pressure (officers, aura-reader, bulletin) forces an adaptation that deepens their compromise rather than changing the macro-course. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they commit to surviving by codifying grief into acceptable artifacts at real emotional cost. The only thing holding it short of top-tier is that the external situation never tightens quite to a knife’s edge—there’s no genuine uncertainty about whether their tactic will work.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: ban lifts → threshold hesitation → entry and first word → dance/communion → charged stillness and step onto the transformed lake. Causality is coherent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the world “remembered how to listen,” grounded in her crossing into the lake’s space. The cost is largely pre-paid (seventeen years of silence) and only lightly reactivated on the page; no new constraint or risk emerges to test her choice in the moment. As an accumulative, lyric piece the arc functions well, but the closure’s cost remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: morning salvage → reed discovery → experimental arrangements → dusk resonance → Marta’s participation → kiln decision; each step grows plausibly from the last. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: Marta’s craft and the courtyard’s role are redefined through the plants’ awakening, with a clear before/after state. Causality is legible and never confusing, though the path is smooth enough that stakes feel more gently fulfilled than pressured. The cost is mostly conceptual—letting ruin and imperfection become the new engine of the craft—rather than dramatized as a hard loss.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: arrival in the lab, ritual arrangement of tools, activation via tuning fork, then climax in her song and the lab’s response. Causality is clean at this lyric scale—each step feels like a deepening of the same act of pilgrimage rather than a new thread. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: silence and stored sounds are re-priced as “seeds,” and the lens glows, signaling an internal and conceptual shift. Stakes remain mostly conceptual, but within that frame the arc is complete and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is cohesive: observatory frame → backstory of rock bottom → method of leaving coordinates → specific outing by the river → return to the bench/locket/ending. Causality is soft but present (her collapse leads to entering the observatory; that leads to her practice; a stranger unfolding a figure coincides with the curtain’s stir and her renewed work). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final act of leaving the crane with the locket and the projected future mourner at the coordinates recast all prior offerings as part of an invisible network. Stakes remain quiet and mostly interior, but the pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly with a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: descriptive groundwork of her practice, an evening of reflection and discovery, then a visitor scene that rephrases and reweights what came before. Causality is soft but present—her mapping leads to the identified convergence points, which in turn frame the later invitation to the stranger. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “They’re remembering forward” and the final unspooling of the tape conceptually reprice the post-crash world. The cost is more conceptual than felt, but the before/after of chaos vs recomposition is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece is a clean single-scene arc with one temporal shard of backstory, all clearly anchored in the archive and the pagoda ritual. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: her research → journey to archive → activation of the pagoda → song that alters how nostalgia behaves. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward memory and forgetting is reweighted with a felt cost and a new option (sharing the song with her daughter). No major orientation or lens-clarity issues impede the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: present-tense vigil → investigation of footage → conceptual realization → decisive act at the archive → resonant return to her perch. Causality is sound under the chosen lens: noticing anomalies leads to investigation, which leads to reinterpreting the shadow, which motivates her intervention with the stone. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: the nature of hope within this dream-sharing world is reweighted, and the world’s dream-streams subtly but concretely change. Stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatized through interpersonal confrontation, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: the past revelation of the con sets the present scene, the reconstruction ritual focuses her dilemma, and closure lands in a concrete plan (resignation, evidence, a new sanctuary). Causality is legible under a situational/causal hybrid lens—her new knowledge about the fraud reshapes her options and produces a before/after stance with visible cost. The ending constitutes a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing of “sanctuary” and “redemption.” The only constraint is that all pressure is internal and largely reflective; no on-page external resistance tests her choice in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: ivy whispers → coffee-ring divination → root-tunnel → seed encounter → merger and revaluation of closure. Structure holds as a continuous quest with one temporal transition (tower to cathedral) that remains clear, and the accumulative lyric texture never muddies who/where/when. Closure is strong: the seed’s dissolution into her scar and the reconfigured hourglass image constitute a decisive conceptual repricing with emotional cost. No major setups are dropped; each introduced element (plants, hourglass, displaced miracle) gets a payoff that reweights earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: psychometry of the film leads to visions, to the projectionist’s grief, to the hidden compartment, to reading the letters, to her decision to release them. The piece reads as accumulative/textural but causality still holds at every step, and the closure—choosing to put unused love “in motion” rather than in storage—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt emotional cost. Structure is linear and contained to one location, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure follows an accumulative, lyric drive: repeated visits and low-grade pressure build toward the winter night when the voices turn furious, forcing an unprecedented escalation. Causality is clean within that mode—her sensitivity leads to burden, which leads to ritual, which scales up into mass liberation—and the closure (voices released, she finally rests) lands clearly with cost. Orientation is solid early (who she is, the town, the archway, the aurora) despite the poetic register, and the single scene window of the climax is well-contained. The main constraint is that stakes and mechanics stay somewhat abstract, so the sense of narrowed options is felt more emotionally than situationally.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: dune → clock → archive seam → search for dim sphere → charm → return and recharged world, with a clean Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is solid early (who/where/what he guards), and the divergence-archive mechanics are consistent enough for this lyric mode. The main limitation is that the “mission” operates more as an untested ongoing state than a pressure-cooker arc—no particular voyage feels meaningfully risked by this specific excursion. Still, the midnight clock’s tremor and brightened petals give a concrete before/after that justifies the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: fall → trek via wind-map → mercury waterfall/gear deepening → arrival at Edge → crossing and reconfiguration. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative lens; the gear, the hum of insight, and the Edge all pay off in sequence, and closure lands as a decisive crossing plus conceptual repricing. However, the supposed danger of the Edge never materially constrains tactics, so the climactic choice reads more like an inevitable culmination than a pressured turn with visible cost. Still, for this length, the single tightening from legend-threat to crossing is functional and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative pilgrimage structure is coherent: leash breaks → guides gather → ridgeway traversal → discovery of artifacts → redistribution of courage-signs. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of “unused courage”) with a clear before/after in how courage is understood and distributed. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens, and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from early on. The main limitation is that the “leash breaking” and its consequences stay metaphorical, so the felt narrative cost at the end is more conceptual than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: routine in the fortress → barometer ritual on the stairs → arrival of child/whistle → choice to restore the bolt and play, all under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. Causality is firm—the past collapse explains the removed bolt; the stain’s color and the child’s presence push him to re-evaluate safety, leading directly to the act of playing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress’s laws of silence are reweighted by a single note, with visible emotional and conceptual cost. There are no orientation issues or dropped setups, though the external consequences of breaking safety remain implied rather than tested, which slightly softens the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: she seeds the library, the intermediaries converge, the ink exposes the pretender, and her refusal reconfigures the power structure. The time jump (“Days bled into weeks”) and summary of the librarian/scribe/general’s path are efficient and coherent within a causal lens. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change (usurper unmasked) plus her renunciation, both on-page and legible in cost. The structure is essentially linear with one calm-to-climax rise and no significant orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: tapping → noticing CALYPSO’s lag → discovering the ECHO logs → realizing the reefs’ state → the dive → the pedagogical ending. Structure is linear with one reflective braid, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the premise of “disappearance” is conceptually repriced. Cost is implicit but legible: years of misframed grief and isolation are recontextualized, not erased. Nothing crucial feels retrofitted or unkept, and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival in the bay → sensing the buried circle → perceiving its activation → answering with song → others gathering, with each step deepening the initial condition of “lull” into rekindling. Causality is legible within the mythic frame: her focused attention and whispered aria trigger the circle’s response, which in turn ignites the dormant community. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebellion is conceptually redefined as listening/remembering rather than violence, and the world’s options shift from stasis to charged readiness. The main limitation is the softness of explicit cost—nothing concrete is visibly lost or risked in that transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene framed by concise backstory, building causally from kite-script → decoding → hot springs rite → embryo release. Orientation is strong from the opening sentence; who/where/why are clear and stay stable. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: destiny is redefined from a singular relic to a distributed possibility across land and children, with the Council’s foreclosed path implicitly costly. The only limit is that opposition and practical consequences remain off-page, so the cost of this choice stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: repeated visits to the arboretum and layered sensory engagement build toward a reconfiguration of the narrator’s relationship to the wedding memory. Causality is soft but coherent: embodied practices → freeze → reframed photograph → ongoing creative ritual → “pearl” concept and final stance. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—the same grief now integrated as compass and pulse rather than anchor—with cost legible in the tears and renewed vulnerability. The structure is essentially one extended scene with embedded past, and while quiet, the arc is legible and satisfying for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-moment stitching → mentor/Tower backstory → ritual construction of the tapestry → decisive act of stepping onto it → reality’s inversion and reconfigured self. Causality is coherent within the story’s rules: her deliberate redesign triggers the lighthouse’s transformation and the cocooning closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: reality remains broken, but her stance toward fracture and selfhood has irrevocably shifted with emotional cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity debt; the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is clear from early on and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal arc is clean: eclipse ends → investigation with ink and recording → discovery of the ink’s trauma-like unraveling → decision to apply it to herself → disappearance and conceptual reframing. Closure lands as a decisive change with clear cost—she vanishes—and a conceptual repricing of time’s slowing as subjective mercy/choice. The drive lens reads primarily causal with strong accumulative texture. The only slight limitation is how quickly the “key” emerges from a single spill, which feels a touch convenient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: archivist confronts artifact → chooses to use Resonance Table → broadcast hits the city → regime reacts → legend/aftermath. The piece uses an accumulative-textural mode after the central act, but that mosaic of reactions still reads as a coherent consequence of her choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s emotional reality changes, the archivist is erased, and the library becomes a charged site, with clear conceptual and social cost. No major orientation or causality slips, though the Resonance Table’s near-omnipotence is accepted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is an accumulative mosaic: visitors arrive, elicit small tests of Elara’s stance, and the final visit from the child reframes the farm’s purpose. Causality is soft but coherent—each beat deepens the same throughline of cultivating continuity and quiet in a ruined world. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Elara gives the child a cutting with ballast cloth, concretizing the premise of “weaving threads between then and after.” The only constraint is that the conflict arc is more atmospheric than sharply turned, so the sense of a decisive structural “before/after” stays gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative ritual structure is coherent: her calibrated movement, voicing of silence, spike conduction, and the echo’s release all build in a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is solidly on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—she fails/succeeds in a complex way by releasing the echo to the constellations instead of “catching” it. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and cosmic rather than sharply personal, which slightly mutes the felt cost despite the conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clear: the journalist’s troubled call prompts her to the observatory, where preexisting surveillance data combines with the latest “accident” to justify a calculated expose via proof-by-contradiction. Structure is tight within a single scene anchored in present action, with backstory serving to clarify current tactics. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: once she sends the evidence package, the city’s status quo is irrevocably altered, even if consequences remain off-page. Stakes could be made more concrete (personal risk, specific opponents) to heighten the felt cost of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: she enters to quiet the haunted firmware, discovers the cradle and letters, confronts L-7 using amber and song, and exits with a reconfigured purpose. Backstory (the father, the unborn child) is interleaved tightly enough that it reweights present choices rather than stalling them. Closure is on-page and decisive: the firmware’s function changes, her practice pivots, and guilt is reframed at a visible cost (blood, confrontation, relinquishing the old role). The structure is mostly linear with one reflective fold and reads coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: arrival in the grotto → ritual with tile/mandala → escalation of whispers → interjection → harmonized hush → external echoes in city and window. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each step deepening the central pressure rather than jumping tracks. Closure lands via conceptual repricing: “emergent hush” is redefined from absence to potential, and that reframing governs the coda scenes. The cost is subtle but legible in her changed behavior (pausing at off-key music, not drawing that night), giving the ending a coherent before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulation: Elira’s discovery of the tessera, the gathering of survivors, the magistrate’s challenge, and the communal renaming all build toward a conceptual closure. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the ending lands as a clear resonant reconfiguration: mercy is redefined and socially taken up, with a felt cost in how it must now “bleed.” Causality is simple but coherent—each move “therefores” from the last, even if the piece leans more ritualistic than plot-driven. The lack of a sharper on-page consequence is what keeps this below elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense haunting → backstory of the opera and coin → targeted intervention with the three echoes → self-sacrificial closure as she joins the orchard. Causality within the lyric mode holds: the coin leads her to the orchard, the spin summons specific echoes, her song alters those lives, and that success finally frees her. Closure is strong and on-page—a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration as she ceases to be an encore-seeking ghost and becomes part of a persistent, hope-luring ecology. The only limitation is that the global drive remains low-stakes situational rather than sharply pressured, so escalation feels gentle rather than tight.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: static shock → sleepless, haunted state → somatic mapping → improvised apparatus → contact with Mateo/frequency → redefinition of what communion is. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she reframes telepathy from chemical link to somatic, fractal communion and commits to sharing it. Causality is mostly implicit but coherent under the textural lens, with each step flowing from the previous state. The main limitation is that costs and constraints of this new stance remain largely conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from establishing her work to the anomalous warming, to the leaf’s floating and question, to her decision to answer and the conduit’s activation, ending in a reconfigured role. Causality is coherent within the factually-mystical rules, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration where her status shifts from archivist to relay/participant. The stakes are largely conceptual and internal, with minimal friction or unforeseen complication once the anomaly appears. That softens the sense of hard-earned cost but not the clarity of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: we move from solitary ritual, to deciphering the prophet, to disseminating tools, to a reconfigured world above versus sanctuary below. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—prophecy becomes distributed “raw possibility” rather than top-down decree—and this before/after is clear. Causality is soft but consistent under a textural lens: buttons → echo → insight → practice of leaving jars. The main limitation is that the global upheaval remains summarized backdrop, so structural stakes skew cerebral rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: single continuous ascent and deposit at the relay station, causally driven by her need to hide the truth where it will outlast current powers. The closure functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she forecloses any direct future involvement and entrusts everything to time, with the cost of remaining erased in the present. Causality is coherent (burned by director → gather proof → choose burial rather than broadcast) and the before/after is legible. The piece leans Accumulative/Textural in rhythm, but the causal spine never blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very clean: fog, rain, gutters, and river pressure build toward the veil-thinning moment when the gutters fall silent and he turns to the passenger. Causality is subtle but firm—his long-cultivated way of moving through the world leads directly to the choice to offer the needle at the threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the bank revealed as threshold, the silent gutters, and the transfer of the needle crystallize a before/after for both characters with conceptual and emotional cost. No orientation issues or broken set‑ups; the single continuous scene is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: present action interleaves with revelation about how time behaves here, building toward a conceptual reconfiguration of “resistance to change.” Causality within that frame is clean: she follows the glass → arrives at oasis → activates it → learns its rule of surrender → makes the choice to leave a soft vessel and depart. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: preservation is redefined and her understanding of fracture shifts. Stakes are modest but coherent; there’s a gentle but perceptible tightening once the glass begins to show non-linear time and the live bee appears.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: last petal falls → mission reframed via the tooth → deliberate circuit placing prisms → charged, contemplative exit. Causality operates more through emotional and symbolic logic than external obstacles, but the throughline is coherent and closure is clearly a Resonant Reconfiguration. The before/after—private caretaker of plants vs. public reflector of light with a re-measured sense of hope—reads legibly and with some cost. The only constraint is that pressure remains gentle, so the structural turn is more tonal than hard-choice driven.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: daily calibrations → brittle awakening with the flood → crisis at the sundial → conceptual reconfiguration of the library’s purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the library shifts from mausoleum to loom, and Veyra from mourner to midwife, with the cost being her continued self-expenditure and acceptance of non-resurrection. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent (cloud-tide surge → stone circle falters → Veyra intervenes → new use of the system), and there are no orientation debts. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and could use one sharper concrete consequence to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clear: storm → mysterious object → ritual of names/birds → supernatural activation → reconfiguration into the temple’s pulse. Causality is mystical but coherent, and the closure has a legible cost as Aris relinquishes his body and former life. The throughline of “thread/connection” organizes the beats so they build rather than merely repeat. Still, there’s only one major tightening (the spiral’s activation), so structurally it feels elegant but somewhat single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: trickster signals → social fracture → Elira identifies the pattern → builds and deploys a counter-signal → community de-escalates → tricksters retreat. The drive lens reads Causal with an Accumulative texture in the social fallout reports, and closure lands as a Charged Poise: she has altered the game and staked herself as defender. Cost is implied (ongoing threat, her solitary vigilance) but not deeply dramatized in the final beat, keeping this just shy of elite. Structure remains a single continuous scene with one well-handled retrospective shard (Tau Ceti) that tilts present stakes rather than stalling them.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: arrival at nexus → organ sound → compass response → forced descent into narrow passage → chamber → realization and return transformed. The piece fits a single-scene descent/ascent structure with a clear closure unit (embodying the key and losing claustrophobia). Cost is present conceptually (taking on responsibility for “rebellious space”) but underplayed emotionally, which keeps it shy of the highest band. Orientation is strong from the outset, with no lens ambiguity or temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: the ribbon leads to the quarry ritual, which draws the man, which leads to the reveal of the masks and the town’s re-engagement with the disappeared women. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with strong textural accumulation), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cases remain “unsolved” legally but transformed socially and emotionally. The main structural weakness is the unearned coincidence of the man appearing exactly when she stages her vigil, with scant groundwork for why this act would reliably summon him. That softens the sense of inevitability in the climax even as the emotional and conceptual closure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: jet stream shift → decoding journals → activating the stanza → storm response → reconfiguration of exile and weather, all under a consistent causal lens. The closure unit is solidly on-page: she alters the jet stream and reconceives exile as pilgrimage, a decisive change plus conceptual repricing. Causal links are generally tight (journal → resonance board → storm answering), with no major orientation or logic slips. The main weakness is that consequences of such a monumental act remain abstract; alarms blare but no concrete cost or hard limit tempers the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a single, continuous scene with a clear before/after: from stunned aftermath of the hitchhiker’s vanishing to a reweighted understanding and new forward motion. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat (glass flake, scaffold flutters, playing, shifting image, mirror silhouette) coherently deepens the central question of disappearance and forgiveness. Closure is strong: the fiddler’s stance toward “never” decisively changes, and the final act of stepping onto the road crystallizes that. The main limit is that stakes remain mostly internal and abstract, which keeps the structural tension from feeling fully razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly legible: childhood legacy → startup rise → collapse → repurposing the train as think-tank, with a solid before/after conceptual shift (loop as dance rather than trap). Causality is mostly accumulative rather than beat-to-beat dramatized, but the arc holds, and the closure is clear and earned. However, key turns—the collapse, the investor pressure, the founding of the roaming think-tank—are summarized rather than staged, softening the felt cost. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and is maintained, but the story stops short of a truly pressurized structural peak.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: observatory work → realization about Zeta Cygni → telegram summons → lucid encounter with the guardian → return to a redefined task. Causality is sound and legible even in a lyric mode; each beat naturally leads to the next, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration of her role rather than a new plot twist. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: pattern recognition and ritual action reweight meaning rather than external reversals. Cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatic, but it is present in her acceptance of an ongoing, weight-bearing vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative structure: arrival after the failed trick → engagement with the lake/seed → internal unbending → reconfiguration of curse and self, all causally linked. The closure is on-page and legible—the curse rearranges and the lake drains as a direct result of her choice to let the seed root and unguard her. Stakes and rules are consistently applied; no late-breaking conveniences undercut the transformation. The only small weakness is that the conjurer’s disappearance serves solely as a prologue spark and never returns as an active consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: glade → backstory of covenant → linked dreamers → ritual at the center, culminating in the covenant’s stirring. Orientation is solid early on (who/where/when are clear), and the closure beat—her heeding and merging with the glade as the covenant uncoils—lands as a Charged Poise/RR with a legible before/after. Causality is more mythic than procedural, but the internal logic (clipping as key, scars as links, glade as node) holds. The main limitation is that the cost and changed options at the end are more implied than dramatized, so the closure feels conceptually strong but not fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scene’s causal spine is clean: Elira’s ritual → Kael’s challenge → her refusal to yield and placement of the card → Kael’s lunge → the orchard’s intervention → the tarot’s collective response → a reconfigured relational state. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: Kael’s grip loosens, destinies are “woven together,” and the ideological stalemate has shifted, with an emotional and conceptual cost to his vengeance stance. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (peace of the dead vs carving destinies) and could benefit from one more concrete, personal consequence, but the structural arc is sound and legible. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds consistently from midpoint to end.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense cataloging, a cue from the cloth, deepening reflection, and a concrete new project form a coherent arc. Causality is modest but clear—his habitual insulation is disrupted by the way the cloth catches light, triggering a reassessment that leads to Project Echo and the pinned motto. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external event, with an implicit cost in abandoning numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival under the arbor → alignment ritual → resonance with the spirit’s ambition → invitation and germination → renunciatory exit. Causality is legible on a conceptual level (her analogical “syntax” provokes the seed’s response), and closure lands via her non-translation and bow, a clear before/after in stance. The cost—refusing to own or decode the new symbol—reads, but its emotional weight is underplayed, keeping this just shy of elite-tier sharpness. Still, for a single-scene lyric piece, the structural arc is impressively tight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: retrieve creel → ritual at pool → shelving by emotional frequency → pivot to next tide. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where her stance toward wonder and contradiction is reaffirmed under a moon phase that softens her. Causality is gentle but present; each step flows logically from the previous and from her role. The cost of this endurance stance is more implied than sharply felt, which keeps the structure from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: approach → discovery → ritual → self-crowning → reconfigured world. Each step follows plausibly from the last within the story’s magical logic, and the closure beat (pearl gone, caves and protagonist glowing) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. There are no orientation issues, and set-ups like the Bureau texts and nautilus shell pay off. The only ceiling is that external consequences remain abstract—what changes beyond this cave is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: each graffiti line and observational ritual layers pressure toward a reconfiguration at Track 3. Structure is clear—station exploration → revelations via graffiti → emotional break → threshold image—and the closure (a new route inked, a louder song) provides a legible before/after. The causal chain is more emotional than event-driven, but each discovery (Point Zero, “Maps lie…”, “Last Departure”) meaningfully tightens her internal journey. No major orientation or lens ambiguity issues undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: each interaction with the library (shelves, volume of “Apologies Swallowed Whole,” the mirror) deepens understanding and leads to the final conceptual turn that she is both seeker and archive. Causality operates under a textural/recursive lens rather than linear plot, and the story teaches that rule (propagation delays, cyclic shelves) early and pays it off at closure. The closure—a conceptual repricing in which arrival is revealed as recursion and authorship—has clear conceptual cost and lands on the page. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (no concrete external risk beyond metaphysical transformation), which keeps this just shy of elite-venue perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Chancellor coming → Elira reads coffee → interprets the violin → activates it → plants carry truth → Chancellor arrives into the aftermath, reweighted by the garden. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: the violin becomes seeds, the observatory becomes a garden, and the empire’s symbolic keystone dissolves with visible conceptual cost. Structure is tight, single-scene, and accumulative; each beat builds toward the final image without extraneous detours. The one softness is the Chancellor’s almost-instant “dawning reverence,” which slightly undercuts potential friction at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: we move steadily from set-up of vocation and chip to the infusion and the final image of drifting lanterns, with a clear Charged Poise closure. Causality within the ritual is internally consistent and orientation is never in doubt. The main limitation is structural flatness: there is only a gentle tightening toward the infusion rather than a true turn or constriction of options. As a result, the piece feels like one beautifully sustained beat rather than a shaped arc under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: climb → grotto reflection → hairpin decision → descent, all oriented in one continuous window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to reframe her wound and re-embody belonging, with the hairpin insertion as the hinge. Causality works at a lyric level (because she has forgiven, she now climbs seeking contentment; because she climbs, the grotto and hairpin catalyze a new stance). The cost—letting go of identity-as-wounded—is legible but understated rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: campfire’s end → climb to lighthouse → chime messages → struggle with the cloak → unhooking → descent with a new stance, all in one continuous window. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens: because of her trade, the shard’s memory and chimes’ code press her toward a decisive act, culminating in a clear before/after. Closure—her choice to keep the shard as inward compass and to offer doubt to clients—is on the page with implied economic and identity cost. The only limitation is that external stakes remain relatively soft and symbolic, relying almost entirely on interior realignment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure with a causal throughline: Elira brings Kael, throws the stone, withholds, and the lesson culminates in his new perception and their pact for tomorrow. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise: the plan to descend, Kael’s vow-like bow, and the awareness that the dangerous “final step” is still withheld but inevitable. Cost is present more conceptually than viscerally—Elira’s history of rejection and the implied risk of vanishing—yet it does reweight the ending. Causality is intact, with no orientation issues, though the scene stops just shy of testing the highest-stakes element (actual vanishing) on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is accumulative rather than causal: observation → flock’s arrival → decoding → acceptance of role, and this pattern holds cleanly to closure. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early and never slips, and the ending functions as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing of “navigation” as stillness. Escalation is modest—the main tightening is the pulse finally “nestling” into the skimmer—so the piece remains more meditative than plot-driven. Nonetheless, closure is clear and on-page with a legible before/after in role.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: touch keystone → mist path → encounter under the tree → conceptual reframing → changed practice in the spire. The piece lands a clear closure beat (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing) when Lior returns, keeps his social failure but reframes his purpose and tactics. Structure is linear with one contained excursion; no orientation or lens issues. The main limitation is that external stakes remain low and the cost, while present, is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: lamplighter → mysterious key and line about luminous vows → dive to the Mnemosyne → ledger revelation → resurfacing and renunciation. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each move logically arising from the last (he dives because of the key and the whisper; he reinterprets the key after reading the vow). Closure is strong: the realization about his prewritten vow and the role of Room 7 reconfigures the entire premise, and the final decision to leave the ledger and walk away without lighting lamps carries a clear conceptual cost. There are no orientation issues or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we start with established ritual (lots), deepen with the backwards-prophecy method, then break pattern when the static arrives unbidden and she refuses to draw lots. Causality holds: the unbidden vision recontextualizes all prior choices and motivates the decisive act of stepping away from chance. Closure is solidly on-page as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—she reframes prophecy and takes leadership without consulting lots—with a clear before/after. Stakes stay legible and contained, though the external situation with the other survivors is sketched rather than stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous evening in the observatory framed by the earlier discovery of the recordings, and the causal chain (recordings → grief → observatory ritual → new purpose) is clear. The drive is accumulative/textural, building through layered actions (unfolding map, invoking light, naming) toward a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands: his stance toward his role and his grief is reweighted on the page with cost. The piece avoids hard turns, but the single deepening is sufficient for its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: world imbalance → shattered bell → mage’s long preparation → resin-guided repair → test via release → partial restoration of the sea. The structure holds as a single continuous ritual scene braided with tightly anchored backstory that always points back to the present action. Closure lands as a quiet but decisive change: fish return and his months of work are surrendered in one irreversible act, with the cost legible in the bell’s loss. The drive reads as Hybrid with an accumulative texture, but the causal throughline never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: resurfacing → investigation via artifacts → gazebo realization → public ritual → confrontation with officials. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing of his mandate and role—is legible and satisfying. Some potentially pivotal beats (the crowd’s reaction, the officials’ decision) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts impact. Still, the before/after of Elias’s function in Hollowmere is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in orchard → ritual with crystal and flame → starlings’ intervention → integration of memory/light → reconfiguration of her stance toward her work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she walks away “flameless but alight,” with the cost of her prior terror and control mindset relinquished in favor of vulnerable openness. Causality is coherent at a lyric level (her surrender enabling the catalyst, which shifts world and self), and there are no orientation issues. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, but for this mode they are legible and fully closed.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: world and role are established, backstory tightens the present, then the low-frequency event forces a choice and reaffirmation. Causality is clear—silence as signal → community anxiety → her decision to frame it calmly via the chime. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the ongoing task and moves toward the next arbor under a stable new equilibrium. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this lyrical scale.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: contemplation → mounting metaphysical pressure → harmonizing contradictions → vivifying the brain → redefinition of the “custody battle.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battle frame dissolves once the duplicate is granted autonomy, and Kael’s stance toward selfhood reweights everything before it. Causality is more spiritual than mechanical but consistent within the piece’s logic; nothing important teleports or contradicts itself. The main limitation is that the external trial feels largely symbolic, so the resolution, while conceptually satisfying, carries limited dramatic surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly chronological and accumulative: seed received → planted with a vow → rooms evolving under its influence → partial sprouting → posthumous journal. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of innovation-through-rot thickens steadily and the final line works as a Conceptual Repricing of the premise (process over outcome). There is no traditional plot “twist,” but the closure is legible and costs are implied in the lifetime of waiting for a bloom that never comes. All major setups (seed, vow, experimental rooms, non-blooming potential) are kept and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: backstory and present-tense ritual weave together, all under the single drive of transforming silence into echo. Causality is emotional rather than event-driven, but clear: daughter’s death → household silence → ritual in tunnel → pact with the hourglass → ongoing vocation as echo-keeper. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: nothing “happens” externally, but his continued, conscious commitment to this work—framed by “after the final grain slips”—solidifies, with cost legible in his isolation and exhaustion. A slightly more marked shift or new pressure in the final third (beyond reiteration) could intensify the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece reads cleanly as an accumulative/textural design in a single continuous situation: the pressure is existential and emotional rather than event-driven, but it coheres. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: relinquishing the pendant, awakening the statue, and then greeting the traveler reweight “waiting” and “uncertainty” with visible cost (surrendering the sole anchor to its homesickness) and new options. Causality within the lyric mode is sound—each beat follows from the pendant’s call and the guardian’s shifting understanding—and there’s no orientation debt. The only ceiling is that the escalation is delicate, lacking a sharper hinge or crisis where an opposing path feels genuinely viable.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene that steadily accrues pressure and culminates in the crozier’s partial vivification and Elric’s conceptual reframing. Causality holds—each introduced element (crozier, shard, moonstone, blood, chant) has a clear function, and the ember nexus’s response follows his actions. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when “creative destruction” is re-named “deconstruction,” reweighting all prior failures as scaffolding. The main limitation is that cost and change are almost entirely internal and philosophical; nothing external tests the new stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The one-scene structure is clean: arrival → setup of coil/fragment → lunar perigee → tuning → activation → departure, with no orientation issues. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: perigee + fragment + cognitive “tuning” enable the city’s reawakening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines ruins as instruments and endings as beginnings, then leaves with the city altered. Cost is mostly conceptual (abandoning prior assumptions and solitary myth), not deeply dramatized, which keeps this below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: repeated vanishings → descent to grotto → discovery and tuning of the radio → pattern work → convergence of ferries → aftermath with erased public memory and ongoing duty. The structure is essentially linear with a brief montage-like compression in the middle, and the closure beat (he returns to routine knowing he’ll be called again) is legible as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The main limitation is that many middle moves compress into summary (“He mapped… He began leaving messages…”) rather than dramatized turns, which slightly flattens the felt stakes. Still, the before/after of the world and his role in it are clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, textural structure is coherent: her stitching escalates until the gallery erupts and reconfigures, then settles into a new equilibrium as she moves on. Causality is stable within the rational-enchantment logic—her weaving triggers the revelation, and the final act of releasing the thread reweights the space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: both gallery and architect have shifted, and the before/after is legible. The main limit is that the cost at closure is conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: exposition of the altered cosmos, a classroom throughline, an interlude with the anchor in her quarters, the blackout balcony scene, and a curricular payoff at semester’s end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats do deepen the central situation, culminating in the anchor-as-symbol lesson and the final image of a city learning to navigate anew. However, causality and stakes remain mild: few choices feel like they close off options or impose visible cost, and most tension is hypothetical rather than enacted. Closure does land as a conceptual repricing—humanity’s stance toward the altered sky reweighted via Elira’s teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: envelope → photograph’s pulse → hearing aid tracking → discovery of the girl → emotional “broadcast” and release. It’s a single, continuous scene with no orientation debt and a clear before/after: a haunted space with a trapped child versus an emptied, calmed atrium. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a big decisive act, but the shift in the photograph’s “pulse” and the girl’s decision to leave her waiting post land on the page. The only structural limitation is that the stakes never seriously wobble—once she engages, success feels nearly assured.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: descent → discovery of the chamber → activation → vision of the unremembered → ascent under the returning tide, with a clear before/after in her relationship to memory and fear. Causality is coherent and the metaphysical rules are signaled early enough (phase transitions, tidal nadir) to make the climax feel prepared, not arbitrary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has completed the act of remembrance and paid with the gold fleck and genuine risk. The main limitation is that obstacles along the way are mostly atmospheric rather than plot-testing her options.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: oriented quickly (who/where/when are clear by sentence two), one continuous scene that builds from arrival, to initiating the process, to a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ink ritual and emerging ghost-voices deepen the central situation until the closure beat where the ghosts are “not saved, but settled” and Aris reconceives error as generative. The cost is conceptual but legible: he remains officially dead, bound to a marginal existence and this strange vocation. The piece lands a resonant reconfiguration without any causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival at canyon → backstory of language death and method → arrival of birds → activation of diamond → release of echoes → reconfiguration at the end. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon shifts from archive to interlocutor, echoing her word “forward” into the world, with a clear conceptual cost in how hard-won that restoration is. Causality between elements (canyon’s echo-rules, diamond’s hunger, flock-grammar) is coherent and consistent. The one limitation is that her success is never seriously in doubt; escalation reads more as ritual unfolding than options narrowing under real threat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure with backstory interleaved as causal setup: Peaks expedition → phone as conduit → arrowhead as key → ritual-like activation in the garden → metamorphosis and aftermath. Causality is strong under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens; each step plausibly leads to the next, and the closure unit (Elara’s reconfigured relationship to her bitterness and the Gravity Dancer) lands clearly on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than perilous, but it is legible in the renunciation of her prior identity as scorned exile. A slightly tighter articulation of what might be risked if the attempt failed or went wrong would sharpen the structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is precise: arrival → first note → statues’ partial softening → sustained playing → orchard’s full reawakening → departure. Causal links (“she plays this way, therefore statues/orchard respond”) are clean, and the closure—a reconfigured world and a charged final apple bite—is fully on the page. The cost is legible (her bodily strain, the spent shell, the weight of ongoing duty), and the before/after is unmistakable. The drive lens (accumulative/textural transformation via music) is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: he brings the storm, learns border surveillance has tightened, adjusts tactics via the arcade infrastructure, then launches the drone under the storm’s cover. Orientation is strong from the opening—who he is, what the disputed border is, and where the arcade sits are all clear and carry through. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the implied success of the storm’s journey reframes his work from “fostering silence” to actively enabling a kept promise, with the emotional cost lodged in his heavier chest and Lena’s absence. The primary limitation is that the key risk and payoff occur mostly in implication off-page, so the decisive change feels more conceptual than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: dream→journey through mist→discovery of train→awakening/finishing the carousel, with a clear before/after in how his silence functions. Causality is intact and simple: the halo fragment draws him, his ritual work animates the carousel, and the final image of the horse circling and bells chiming provides a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Orientation (who/where/what-roughly-when) is solid very early, and there are no rule-breaking surprises. The main limiter is that the closure’s “cost” is mostly conceptual—beauty unfinished as wound, silence revalued—rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: library → Restricted Stacks → scroll + scarf → activation → story-world → reawakening → return. Structure is essentially single-scene with one metaphysical transition, and the orientation (odd-hour librarian in a scientific poetry library) is established early and stays clear. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines her role and the nature of analog stories, and the world outside is subtly altered as patrons feel the change. The main limitation is that stakes and costs at the climax are more conceptual than dramatized, so the decisive turn feels serene rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is accumulative/lyric, moving from broad routine and world description into a focused, culminating dawn scene, and the pattern is taught early and held. Causality is clear under this lens: years of practice and specific light-collection events (double sunrise, mentor’s disappearance) lead to her deciphering and mixing the cipher that finally summons the dream. Closure is on-page and costs are legible in the baked-in years of search, loss of mentor, and the implied life organized around an absence. The before/after reconfiguration—longing as pursuit versus longing as something that can be “savored”—reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: nexus → star’s hint → door → corridor of mirrors → idea → exit with reconfigured world-stakes. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: the idea is freed, taken into the world, with the future child image reweighting what we’ve seen. The main weakness is a relatively low sense of jeopardy or cost to failure, so the journey feels almost destined rather than contested. Structure is nonetheless tight for a single continuous scene and satisfies the closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal throughline: folklore → research → constellations → experiment → hum/memory seepage → choice. Backstory and exposition about the wrecks and the orchard’s rules are well-woven and consistently pay off in the experiment with the trawler and the mushroom’s pulse. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she arrives with a drive to recover, ends poised to let the orchard “take the rest,” with the cost legible. Escalation is more intellectual and atmospheric than situationally urgent, which keeps it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is accumulative and very controlled: tea leaves, shadow, exile, and mentorship iterate and deepen rather than simply repeat. Causality is more spiritual than mechanical but still coherent: her methods and stance modulate the shadow’s containment and the terms of her exile, culminating in the cartographer’s shift and the shadow remaining trapped. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the exile remains reversible, but the cost of holding that line is reweighted by the final image. The lack of a single sharp inciting “event” or turn keeps this just shy of the very top band, but the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene on the parapet, an accumulative build toward the weaving, and a resonant closure as the seam between worlds knits tighter and the seed is anchored. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and under that lens the pattern of memory-weaving and environmental hush coheres. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—wonder is preserved and the seam reweighted—though the cost is conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. Well-shaped and publishable, but the stakes never face a moment where failure feels briefly possible.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is clean: arrive, begin methodical work, hit a uniquely dangerous knot, weather the outburst, then complete the net and depart under reconfigured silence. The black knot and the fisherman’s confession function as a clear central turn that deepens and tightens the existing pattern rather than derailing it. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the sanctuary and world’s quiet are palpably altered, and her ongoing burden is legible. Causality is coherent throughout, with each step of the ritual feeding the next.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: research → on-site alignment → shadow choreography → chapel’s negative-space revelation → reverent departure. Causality is coherent within the lyrical frame, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the chapel’s “absence” is decisively re-priced as a living presence, with her accepting an ethic of witnessing over excavation. The cost is conceptual rather than plot-driven, but legible in her choice to offer a looped film as invitation, not proof, and to leave the site intact. Orientation is strong throughout; no temporal or spatial confusion undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery → investigation → metaphysical realization → enacted letting go, with each phase tightening the focus on the globe and the question of release. Causality holds under a lyric, lightly speculative frame (her pattern-noticing leads to the “receiver” insight, which leads to the cliffside test); closure comes from an on-page decisive act that pays off the setup. The cost—relinquishing the object that has become her conduit to Earhart and her sister—is legible and thematically tied. Some key turns (Earhart “ascending,” the captain’s ritual sinking) are delivered in compressed exposition rather than dramatized friction, which slightly flattens middle-beat tension.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb to sanctuary → encoding and invocation → communion with the ghost → a broadened project of connection, with each step logically following from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from private, almost secret communion to an explicit invitation for other lonely, “driftingly alert” souls to join. Stakes remain modest and interior—there’s no strong external obstacle or reversal—which keeps escalation relatively gentle. Still, the throughline of “will she be answered/understood, and what then?” is coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: an elevator ascent punctuated by floor markers, each adding a layer (cipher, vellum, diary, reconfiguration) toward an on-page realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through discoveries rather than reversals, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing at the observation deck. Causality is coherent—light → cipher → vellum → diary → stance—without teleporting props or rule breaks. The cost of her new understanding is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps the closure strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous gondola scene laced with a single, pivotal backstory shard (the broken violin string) that reweights all present action. Causality is clean—husband’s silenced music → escape to sky → “spooled wholeness” as method → present-night test with Altocumulus #112. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she names the cloud “release” and accepts dissolution without panic, then smiles having “proven…that empty spaces remember.” Structure is slightly static but the reflective passages consistently tilt the present rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single continuous scene in a charged window (night to dawn) with clear causal flow from opening the safe to painting to awaiting demolition. The chosen drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the pressure accrues through sensory detail and ticking time rather than reversals, and closure lands in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment as she chooses to sit beneath her completed sky and accept destruction. Stakes and cost (the loss of the library, the privacy of her work, the solitude of her understanding) are present and coherent, even if kept intimate in scale. There are no orientation issues or broken setups; the piece knows exactly how much plot it can carry at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: hopscotch noticed → phrasebook phrase reinterpreted → pattern tested against birds and logs → demonstration to captain → ship-changing application. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Arlen shifts from apprentice-observer to fluent “speaker” of luminance, altering the ship’s options and the outside world’s response. Cost is mostly conceptual (reweighting how the sky can be used) rather than felt sacrifice, which keeps the ending powerful but somewhat low-pressure. Structure is linear and tight, with no orientation issues or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walk through the library → open the Hall → mirrors replay decisive memories → the gear-constellation imparts the rhythm → she leaves reconfigured. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each step deepens rather than detours, and the closure (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) is clearly on the page. The dominant stake is internal understanding, and the story honors that quietly without false external dramatics. A slightly sharper on-page dilemma or obstruction in the Hall itself would tighten the sense of structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: thinning orchard → Elira’s choice of chalk messages → bell activation at the third moon → butterflies → nebula revealed → community steps toward departure. The drive feels Hybrid (causal spine with lyric accumulation), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: community status shifts from settlers of Virelune to pilgrims to the nebula, with the orchard left behind. Cost is implied—leaving their hard‑won home—but not dramatized in specific, resistive actions. Structure is tight for the length, with no major orientation or logic gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ascent → installation of the head → activation of nested patterns → universe’s soft extinction, all cohering under a lyric, textural drive. Causality under that lens is solid—the puppet’s placement, the turning of the spindle, and the eye’s fall clearly ladder into the final “after-silence” state. Closure lands strongly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s death is reframed as a lullaby and act of honoring with real conceptual cost. The only thing holding this just below the very top band is the relative lack of on-page tactical friction or decision-turns within the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: orientation arrives early, the backstory of the previous caretaker and the nut is efficiently woven in, and the throughline (locate and guide the lost girl before frost) remains legible. Causality under a largely situational lens is coherent: his prior decoding of the nut’s blueprint enables his safe paths, which enables his indirect rescue tactics. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: he gives up the nut and recommits to his burden as frost closes in, with a clear before/after in responsibility and cost. The rescue itself is smooth enough that the middle lacks a strong structural kink or complication, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, reflection-led structure is coherent and well anchored: single POV, one present-time visit to the ravine, with one flashback (last monsoon) that’s clearly cued and functionally reweights the present. Causality under a textural lens holds: river/foam → insight about phase change → reframing of daughter’s death and scaffold → decision to redesign polymer and re-engage the lab. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing, with visible cost (relinquishing a blame-based identity, accepting impermanence) on the page. There are no orientation slips or unkept setups, though the external stakes remain quiet and primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure (a day of transactions building toward seven incisions and an open ledger) is clean and coherent under a textural drive lens. Orientation is quick: who she is, where the library is, and what she’s doing are all legible early. The closure beat—a ledger left open after seven measured erasures—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (her self-erasure as ongoing work). The main limitation is that no single causal turn significantly alters her options; the piece deepens rather than “turns,” which is effective but modest in scale.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: rain reveals geometry → descent → pavilion contact → basin climax → release and return, with a clear before/after. Causality is tight within an accumulative/lyric frame, and closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the pavilion is emptied, the fortress reweighted, and Elira altered. The cost—being “hollowed but whole,” burning with borrowed heartbreak—is legible and paid on the page. The piece doesn’t quite reach the highest band because escalation is steady rather than sharply turned, and there’s little sense of potential failure once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: ascent to the tower, ritual preparation, song, the elevator’s awakening, and communal aftermath. Causality holds under an accumulative/ritual lens—each step (weight, memory core, multilingual song) builds toward the reconfiguration of the silo into a sanctuary. Closure is present and satisfying, but the transformation happens with almost no on-page complication or cost. The beat progression is elegant but somewhat frictionless for a “prestige” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural build rather than causal-plot-heavy: arrival → discovery of mirror → entangled memory exchange → reframing and decision to return. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she leaves with a new project (“museum of salvaged dreams”) and a reweighted understanding of grief as modifiable energy. Causality is coherent—touching the mirror triggers memories, which trigger reconfiguration—but pressure stays mostly steady rather than tightening through distinct turns. The structure fits the chosen mode well, yet a sharper mid-beat hinge or small external disruption would deepen the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: reentry during the anomaly → thresholds → Fragment Delta → activated sigil → secret chamber → Seed. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (she acquires the Seed and exits, world subtly reweighted) under a mostly causal lens with light accumulative texture. The main structural limitation is that stakes and cost remain primarily conceptual; there’s no real risk she might fail or be harmed, which flattens tension even as the sequence of beats is sound. Still, set-ups (doodle, anomaly, thresholds) all pay off without cheating.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: prolonged silence → discovery of insulator → analysis of cracks into a score → creation of the resonance chamber → awakening of the grove. The structure is linear with one quiet but definite escalation into the climax where the grove “shudders awake,” followed by a resonant cooldown. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: silence is repriced as latent potential, and the world’s state is visibly different afterward. The cost is mostly effort and emotional exposure rather than risk or loss, but it is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structurally, this is a single continuous meditation scene with a clear before/after: he arrives burdened and leaves carrying a reconfigured purpose. The causal chain is accumulative rather than plot-heavy, but the closure—recognizing the eclipse as reset and deciding to teach others—is legible and motivated. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when are clear). The main limitation is that the “before the next phase” clock never really bites, so the mid-scene pressure feels relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: set-up of the workshop and diary, iterative frequency attempts, and then the clasp’s surrender leading to the catalog scene and fireworks counterpoint. Causality is simple but coherent—each sonic adjustment moves the clasp toward opening—and the closing beat (letting fireworks rage while she aligns herself to the diary’s hum) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible before/after stance. The cost is subtle—a life spent in quiet, difficult listening rather than outward spectacle—but present. No major orientation or lens ambiguity issues weaken closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—seed introduced early, long dormancy, omen, bloom, village aftermath—builds cleanly toward a conceptual reconfiguration of the village’s emotional life. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: the tide’s thought turning and the bloom’s stench precipitate a shift from repression to shared grief. Closure is clearly on the page: the village’s behavior changes and Elira’s practice continues with new depth. The main limitation is that most turns are foretold or fated rather than emerging from hard tactical choices, which keeps tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: inversion window → search → discovery of arrow → test on Grandmother → planetary song and redefined purpose, all in a single coherent scene. Causality is strong and legible (her decision to jam the arrow into the fissure is a clear hinge), and the Hybrid/accumulative lens holds through the closing conceptual shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: resilience is redefined as remembering, and her role reconfigured from pilot to echo. The main limitation is that the cost and risk around her central acts remain low-key, so the climax feels more revelatory than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear causal logic from arrival, through surveying, to a charged final decision. The Global Drive Lens reads as Hybrid (causal investigation plus conceptual repricing at the end), and that lens holds. Closure lands as Charged Poise: his commitment to mapping the next convergence and stepping into the “learning” wind marks a before/after in stance with implied risk. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it is legible on the page via time pressure, eerie isolation, and the known lethality of prior “gusts.”

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: preparation → initial chime → intensifying transformations → culminating unfettering → quiet exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush is reshaped and internalized, wonder confirmed as “oxygen,” and she leaves altered and carrying a new charge. Causality is lyrical rather than mechanical but consistent—each chime escalates the cavern’s response and leads naturally to the final revelation. The main limitation is the absence of any meaningful risk of failure or reversal, so the arc feels inevitable rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: uncasing → preparation with driftwood → seam entry → autopsy of realms → return and renunciation, all causally linked under an accumulative/lyric lens. The closure unit is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses the path of repair, redefines her role as “keeper of thresholds,” and leaves the flute as monument, with conceptual and emotional cost clearly legible. The between-place shard is well signaled and functions as an intensification rather than a digression, keeping the drive coherent. One could argue for a slightly sharper on-page confrontation with risk in the seam itself, but the overall arc is structurally sound and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/lyric structure: vignettes about pamphlets, the skeptic, the warlord, and the halo build toward a conceptual repricing in the final glyph and her departure. Causality is coherent within that mode—the halo’s use leads to others’ collapses and dimming, and the last star’s vanishing cues her final act—so the closure unit is legible and thematically charged. That said, the story leans heavily on summary beats rather than one pressured on-page scene, so escalation feels more like a catalog of prior uses than a present-tense tightening. The result is satisfying but a shade too essayistic in rhythm for top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: ridgeway ascent → fork choice → Hollow Market encounter → return and renunciation, with the flashback to the mentor anchored in present stimuli and altering present options (she chooses wonder over mere efficiency). Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each use of the pendant deepens its meaning and builds to the final decision to release it. Closure lands on-page as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change—she forecloses reliance on the pendant as a tool, accepting loss and a changed way of moving through routine. Stakes are modest but coherent; there are no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival with purpose → communion via prism/frost → layered revelations → conceptual realization and ethical decision → resonant exit. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through increasingly intimate memories and culminates in the reweighting from tragedy to peace and from external proof to private resonance. Closure is solid as a conceptual repricing plus earned stasis (she refuses to publish), with a legible before/after. The only limitation is that the cost of that refusal, while implied, is not strongly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: courier loss → discovery of the puzzle → reconstruction of the loom → self-weaving ritual → bead’s arrival in the future city. Causality tracks under a mythic/lyric logic, and the closure beat—her self-sacrifice enabling the bead to reach him—is clearly on the page with a felt cost. The city shard at the end is brief but effective, closing the causal loop without over-explaining. There are no orientation or lens issues, and the drive from isolation to connection is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure: repeated descents, the thinning silk, and villagers’ quiet transformations building toward the decisive act of spending the last length. Causal links are clean—find silk → forge courage-tools → silk depletes → final offering returns magic to the world—and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Arlo “becomes the barter.” The main limitation is that most of this is narrated in summary rather than dramatized in discrete, pressured beats, so the central turn feels conceptually strong but experientially gentle. It’s structurally sound and complete, but not yet maximally pressurized for top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → portal activation → Sigma-7 bay → archive → data core revelation → return, with no major logic gaps. The structure fits a short-form causal drive with one main tightening (entering a universe where she never existed) and a clear closure beat via conceptual repricing when she learns she’s an anchored divergence. Stakes remain focused and the before/after is legible: she moves from conjecture about a silenced truth to specific, costly knowledge of her mother’s sacrifice. The only limitation is that the path in Sigma-7 feels almost frictionless—access to the crucial archive and core is too easy, slightly softening the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense arc in the lighthouse framed by concise, functional backstory. The key turn is the lamp going out, then returning after his ritual, creating a quiet but definite before/after reconfiguration. Causality leans accumulative and symbolic rather than literal, yet the closure’s emotional cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: tonight’s unusual stellar urgency and the lantern’s activation slightly deepen an already-established routine rather than driving a causal plot. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of her sleepless, loving vigilance reweights the earlier routine with a sense of cost and ongoing duty. The stakes (steering thresholds of human longing toward wonder) are mostly conceptual but coherently carried from start to finish. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper before/after hinge where tonight forces a new stance instead of confirming the old one.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear accumulative structure: repeated sunrises studying the wing, conceptual insights (angle then structure), observation of the old man as a living analogue, and finally the experiment with the dye that alters what fabric can do. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she stops chasing others’ magnetism and channels her own fractures into the cloth, with patrons’ reactions confirming a real shift. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each insight flows plausibly from the last—but the cost of this shift is mostly conceptual, with emotional stakes inferred rather than sharply dramatized. Still, the before/after in her stance is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: tower → deconstruction → moonlight healing → revelation of dreams → decision to follow into the forest → new role at the end. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, and the closure—her renunciation of “fixing” in favor of cartography of sorrow—lands on the page with a clear before/after. Orientation is excellent from the opening line, and the two-shard structure (tower, then forest) transitions smoothly. The only ceiling limiter is that the cost of her shift remains mostly conceptual, leaving the closure powerful but not quite devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: problem (dawn trapped, songs forgotten) → attempt (her humming) → communal joining → release of light and reconfiguration of the realm. Causality is clean within the lyric frame—the hum invites others, the song frees the dawn, the world remembers itself—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after stakes. The closure image of the realm swaddled in song and the mica turned to mirrors feels earned and legible in cost (the long silence, her scattered mind, the labor of collective remembering). Still, the pressure arc is gentle and largely foregone, with no serious doubt that the ritual will succeed, which softens structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-moment discovery of the invitation triggers reflection on the past fire/betrayal, which in turn motivates her decision to step into the aisle and claim presence. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a situational core—pressure builds via layered realizations rather than external events, and closure is a resonant reconfiguration when she shifts from hiding to open custodianship. Causality is intact (finding the invitation → reinterpretation → public act), and the ending image (reading aloud as the Society arrives) clearly marks a before/after. Stakes remain largely internal and low-key, but the emotional cost of giving up a protective exile is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural drive: each beat (courtyard → bakery memory → tea house → offering → uncloaking → gardening) deepens the central stake of resisting numbness. Causality is soft but coherent: the vanished bakery leads to her role as “creeping normality noticer,” which in turn motivates her ritual in the tea house. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from witnessing decay to enacting a quiet, risky hope (seeding, uncloaking) and the spring’s drip answers her gesture. Stakes remain interior and modest but are clearly reweighted at the end with a credible cost (she accepts no guarantees, only the right to keep asking).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: approach → activation of the Array → successive vows → the nearly-extinguished “I forgive you” → translation and return of the slide, culminating in the library’s subtle “exhale.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the stakes shift from potential loss to translated survival, with the cost embodied in the slide’s dimming. Causality is stable and legible under a textural lens, and the “as illusions fade to memory” clock provides a modest tightening. The main limitation is that the pressure never quite feels precarious; success seems assured, so structural tension plateaus rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: her past failed attempts justify her current stealth tactic; the watch fob’s history primes its use as a trigger; the drunk’s bump works as a believable false start that heightens risk. Orientation is immediate and solid (who/where/when are clear within the first few lines), and the scene holds a single continuous pressure line. Closure lands as a decisive change: the deal collapses, trust between Marla and The Chain shatters, and her mission is complete with a felt cost in her continued anonymity. The drive lens is essentially causal with a light accumulative texture around the fob and hush, and it holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → travel to convergence point → use of ring/taste method → encounter with the weather-carrier → forest’s vote and its result. The structure is a single, continuous scene with one deepening turn (realizing the forest is voting on absorbing him) leading to closure when the storm is taken and she pockets the ring. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward doubt and trust reweights the whole premise. A minor limitation is that the broader “elections” frame stays mostly conceptual rather than dramatically tightening time or options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a single, continuous ritual scene interwoven with reflection that’s always anchored in present action (descent, kneeling, tears, mind-sketching, drawing). Causality is accumulative rather than plotty: her uncorking leads to visions, which animate the cave, which resonates with the lock, which yields the charcoal nub and enables the freeing-drawings. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she ascends changed, with the lock pocketed and her stance toward her calling reweighted. Stakes are internal but legible, and the before/after contrast (corked vs. chosen creativity) is clear with an emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the map → traversal through atriums → retrieval and reading of the letters → reconfiguration of her role. Causality is coherent at every step, and the piece teaches its pattern (move deeper into the greenhouse, find more “lost” words) early and then fulfills it. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: “The map had served its purpose. Now, she would become the archive,” with the cost implied in the responsibility she assumes. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with light causal framing) holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clearly accumulative/lyric: ritual, world context, child visitation, and eventual death build toward a conceptual closure where the sculpture continues as an autonomous keeper of wonder. Causality is soft but legible, and anchoring (who/where/when) is established quickly enough that the orientation test is satisfied. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the drive shifts from her personal vigil to an ongoing, depersonalized pattern—with an implied cost in her absence. The lack of a sharper turning point or on-page decision undercuts the potential for a higher structural score in a competitive market.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: storm/magnetic shift and failing systems parallel the caretaker’s rising inner static, leading causally to opening the box, the controlled burn, and syncing with the farm. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the caretaker’s internal noise harmonizes, the farm stabilizes, and its identity as caretaker is redefined with cost (relinquishing the box and prior mode of fear-containment). Causality is intact and legible, with no orientation issues and a clear before/after. The only limitation is that the cost of success feels conceptually implied more than concretely dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: locket → humming → Leo’s door → repeated visits → mailbox ritual → catharsis, with no orientation or logic breaks. The mailbox rule (she never opens it herself) and the Tuesday pattern give the structure a quiet inevitability. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Leo’s relationship to his mother’s unfinished goodbye is altered, with the softened humming as concrete proof of cost and change. Stakes are modest but coherent, suiting a hybrid causal/accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story runs on an accumulative/textural drive with causal threads: Elira’s established methods lead to misdirection of drones, awakening submersibles, then the self-encrypting final dance. Closure lands cleanly as a conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration—she chooses to become algorithmic resistance instead of escaping, with the cost of her own embodied life. The buoyed journals washing ashore and seeding future dances provide a clear before/after frame without over-explaining. Structure is tight for a lyric, with no major orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: whale beached → chamber anomalies → pattern match with father’s journal → doorway → crossing and reunion. The causal links hold under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new image (whale, salt, flowers, gravity) tightening a single throughline rather than branching into subplots. Closure is solidly on the page: she crosses into the pocket and finds her father, and the before/after is legible with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; the world rules are consistently signaled and then reweighted by the “memory isn’t erased, it’s displaced” realization.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene accumulative structure: arrive at brook → enact ritual → encounter whisper → re-interpret prophecy → release it. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, with each beat deepening the central situation rather than wandering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—prophecy recast from doom to summons, her role redefined as guardian-listener—but the cost is primarily conceptual, with limited felt sacrifice. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: an accumulative single-POV piece that moves from premise → pattern of Tuesday lies → rooftop reveal → charged descent toward the vault. Causality is intact and legible—her persistent “research” visits lead to his suspicion, which leads to tonight’s exchange of seal and key. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from one-way listening to reciprocal communication with a sentient building, with their relational contract subtly redefined. Stakes remain quiet and conceptual rather than sharply tested, but the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear temporal arc from twilight to dawn, and a live clock via the fading stars. Causality is simple but coherent—she comes to archive before memories dissolve, uses the shell, reaches a vow, then relinquishes the object. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she accepts sovereignty over healing, with the cost of remaining alone but fluent in her past. Orientation is stable throughout; no structural or lens ambiguity undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: theft of the thorn and key → access to vault → rewriting scroll → drought’s end, with no major logic gaps. The piece maintains a single continuous scene under a clear drive lens (complete the treasonous revision before the “clock” of the stalactites runs out), and closure is decisive: the curse unravels and Elira exits changed. Cost is legible in her physical and spiritual exhaustion and in her permanent anonymity. The only structural limitation is that no serious on-page obstacle ever threatens outright failure, so the path feels somewhat foregone even as it’s beautifully rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: opening ritual with the shell → layered revelations about echoes → discovery of the entity → climactic night of singing and a changed dawn. Causality is coherent (her listening leads to knowledge, which leads to a deliberate non-destructive confrontation), and the closure—a reconfigured relationship between singer, echoes, and entity—lands firmly. The decisive change is the entity shrinking to a listening sigh and ceasing to feed, with her accepting the role of vessel. Some of the key mechanics (e.g., how exactly her singing returns resonance) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly dulls the sense of on-page cost and tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—present-tense ritual framed by explanatory middle and the dream-ripple coda—reads coherent and purposeful, with a clear before/after in the child’s release and the fading cameos. Causality is soft but consistent: globe → dream cameos → her mapping → installation in ice → dispersed ripples in strangers’ lives. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, and the “sea remembers everything” return ties the loop. The limitation is that the central action is never seriously in doubt, so the climax feels more like confirmation than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: she climbs, observes, remembers, enacts a small ritual of witnessing, and descends, with the fireflies and harbor lights binding the arc. Orientation is excellent from the opening lines, and the reflective passages are grounded in present stimuli. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her role as quiet keeper of unseen threads crystallizes in the “I see you” and final descent. The main limitation is that the “turn” is gentle—more confirmation than transformation—so the before/after divide, while present, is not sharply stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line is clean: reassembled letters → discovery of orchard → experimental placement of the diamond → environmental shift → discovery of plaque → decision to continue across a network. The piece uses a mostly continuous scene with embedded backstory that is well anchored in present stimuli (orchard, letters, plaque). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her mission scales from one mystery to a world-spanning network, and the cost is her commitment to a long, risky task in a devastated world. Stakes are more conceptual than immediate, but they’re coherent and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear orientation, a rising line (storm as veil → contact from rebels → decision to broadcast), and a legible closure beat when she hijacks Kael’s towers. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with causal turns, and that holds through the end. However, the cost and constraint at closure are soft; nothing actively threatens or complicates her attempt, so the before/after shift feels more visionary than hard-won. That limits the impact of the Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: dawn rituals → discovery/repair of the music box → community exchanges → anonymous jars → the child beat → disappearance and resonant loft image. Causality is soft but intact; each move arises logically from the last, especially the way the music box crystallizes his true motive. Closure is strong: his vanishing and the humming jars function as a resonant reconfiguration with an undeniable cost (his absence) and a clear before/after. The piece does lean on summary rather than dramatized turning points at times, which keeps it just shy of top-tier structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: the ice song → key activation → descent to the Heartstone → scavengers’ attack → her resonant counter-response → wide-scale harmonic release. The structure is linear, with one main escalation and a clear closure in which the threat is neutralized and her role redefined. The cost at closure (her physical depletion, the moral reconfiguration of the scavengers) is present but relatively soft, giving the climax a touch of ease. Still, the global drive is coherent and the before/after line is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design: one continuous span of time with seasonal markers, building toward a quiet closure as spring threatens and she chooses to keep mapping. Causality is coherent—her rituals shift the viaduct’s resonance, attract people, unsettle rulers, and culminate in the regime’s silent surrender. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the revolution deepens rather than ends, with the cost being her ongoing, disciplined attention and renunciation of spectacle. The cost remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-POV descent-and-return with a legible investigative throughline: worker’s death → anomalous tunnel → memory-field explanation → choice to anchor and continue. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: empirical observations and ghostly images build toward a conceptual repricing of “preventable death” as civic amnesia. Closure is solid—a resonant reconfiguration where she accepts an ongoing burden rather than solving the haunt—though the diagnostic leap from data to “rupture in the tunnel’s memory-field” is a bit convenient. Still, the before/after—routine case vs. charged, ongoing responsibility—is clear with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset and the causal spine—promise → months of failed effort → light-triggered insight → successful repair → internal reconfiguration—holds. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward his own guilt changes, with cost legible in the years of penance and the difficulty of the work. The light-beam realization borders on convenient but is anchored in the storm and shadow mechanics enough to feel earned rather than miraculous. Structure is simple but tight for the length, with no major loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent: arrive → feed relic to Engine → kaleidoscope images → transliteration → bell’s first stir, with no broken links. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, with a single clean closure beat when the bell “whispered for the next one.” Cost is present but light—mainly exertion and partial success rather than a foreclosed path or hard loss. Structure (single continuous scene, single POV) is tight and immediately publishable, though the climax could bear slightly more consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is accumulative rather than scene-driven, moving cleanly from discovery of the patch and Helios erasure to the escalating 0707 pattern, the decision to trigger a mass restore, and a reconfigured status quo. Causality holds under the textural lens: noticing patterns → investigation/lies → ritualized restore at 07:07 → new understanding and role. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: deleted files/people don’t “go” anywhere but linger in the substrate, and she shifts from seeker to anchor at real conceptual cost. The main weakness is that key turns (e.g., hacking in the deepest vault, consequences from corporate forces) are compressed into exposition rather than given on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: walking the orchard, sampling vignettes of empathy, culminating at the oldest mirror where the process turns inward. Causality is soft but coherent—each mirror encounter builds the method and stakes until she confronts herself and explicitly reframes peace as “presence of choice.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the shard’s incompleteness as “enough” and leaves with a new mission stance. The structure is simple but fully functional for this lyric mode, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival and listening pattern → winch fall and uncanny chime → glacier collapse and deliberate drift onto the floe → rescue and postlude reconfiguration. Causality is mostly solid, with the magical premonition accepted as a world-rule rather than a cheat, and her later hospice work is legibly tied to that experience. Closure is clear and on-page: she declines euthanasia and repurposes her gift, a decisive conceptual and behavioral change with cost. The only minor weakness is that the disaster’s macro-stakes remain slightly abstracted, more heard than felt locally beyond her personal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds a clean single-scene structure with a causal arc: Elias invites, Mara resists, he reframes through the vines, she reinterprets their past, and the letter’s final placement seals the changed understanding. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: their relationship moves from “failed love” to “meant to be differently,” with Elias confirmed as sentinel of understanding. Stakes are modest and interior, but the before/after is legible and emotionally coherent. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, though the arc borders on too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → attunement to pavilion/parapet → conjuring clearings → satisfied stillness and departure. Causality is coherent under a textural lens, with the parapet’s awakening and the clearings’ formation functioning as legible escalations. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pavilion is consecrated, wisdom preserved, and her journey continues with altered stakes for this place. The cost is subtle (her expenditure and the irrevocable sealing of echoes) but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: we move photo by photo toward a quiet, charged closing image with the case among blooms. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration—reaffirming her ongoing practice and reweighting decay as fertile ground—but the before/after divide is subtle and low-cost. Causality is consistent (she studies, reflects, replaces, moves on) and orientation is solid, with no temporal or spatial confusion. Still, the piece reads more as a sustained mood vignette than a scene with a meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: repeated mornings of listening culminate in a single anomalous chime that poses a question, which she answers differently than usual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she foregoes transcription and conceptual mastery in favor of inhabiting uncertainty, with the cost implied in relinquishing her long-held method. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent and unbroken. The quietness of external stakes keeps it just shy of the very top band but fully publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation in the garden, following the driftwood compass, then the Betamax stack and chalk-screech that finally reveals the sound of aging. Causality is coherent under a lyric, slightly surreal frame—the driftwood points him to the tapes, the chalk lures echoes, the curse ensures he’ll lose what he finds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he attains his goal but must relinquish memory of it, with the garden and chalk holding the trace. There are no orientation problems; who/where/what are clear very early.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is a clean single-scene arc with accumulative/textural drive: she climbs, prepares the device, invokes the leaf, rides out the shaking, and emerges into a reweighted reality. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and firm, and the pattern of recurrence (hand, leaf, shaking) is taught early then resolved. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: time braids, the universe “remembers how to breathe,” and her relation to time has a clear before/after. The only ceiling on this score is that the planetary-scale threat resolves somewhat smoothly, with the cost framed more as emotional surrender than a sharply felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece works well as an accumulative/lyric structure: Elara ascends, establishes a mission, then each “mundane hymn” incrementally moves souls toward connection, culminating in the shard’s dissolution and her earned stillness. Causality is soft but coherent—her singing leads to spirits turning toward each other, the shard mending, then dissolving. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: reunification is reframed as honoring brokenness, and the final listening posture feels like an earned stasis. Stakes and cost remain gentle, but they’re legible within the spiritual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: spoons → broken sky/noon → key discovery → repeated experiments → threshold crossing → new equilibrium with shadows. The loop structure (seventeen nights, gradual learning) builds a coherent progression ending in a decisive reconfiguration where she becomes “keeper of thresholds.” Cost is mostly conceptual—there’s little on-page sacrifice or jeopardy beyond implied existential risk—so the ending feels more elegant than hard-won. Still, closure is clear and satisfying under a hybrid causal/conceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: substitute found → she seeks the garden → performs bone-setting ritual → leaves having reframed the town’s myth and her role. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story deepens rather than reverses, culminating in a clear conceptual repricing of changelings and grief, with the tooth/garden charged at closure. Causality is soft but coherent, with each movement logically flowing from the last, and the final image marks a before/after in how loss will be held. The main ceiling comes from relatively low on-page resistance; nothing actively pushes back against her project in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens the structure is clean: the ritual of polishing, backstory, and villagers’ arrival build toward the child holding the glass and the protagonist’s silent acceptance. Causality is consistent (vow → ritual → grotto as refuge → constellations for villagers), and reflection is always anchored to present stimuli. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her long-standing stance is affirmed but newly shared and witnessed, with the cost (reliving the burning, exile) still palpably in play. There are no orientation issues and no late-breaking rule changes undermining the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, moving through one continuous ritual visit that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses transformation over erasure by placing, not burning, the confession under moss. Causality is simple but coherent—each act in the sanctuary follows from the viral exposure and her desire to redefine it. Closure lands quietly but clearly, with a before/after legible in how she relates to the confession and to her future returns. The cost (living beside the wound rather than deleting it) is present, though understated.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: the pattern of cameos, internalization, then spatial shift from nexus to pier culminates in a resonant reconfiguration when she lays down the shell and writes the first “true” sentence. Causality is soft but coherent—her experiences at the nexus plausibly lead to a changed relationship with unfinished work. Orientation (who/where/when) is legible very early, and the single transition is smooth. Cost is present conceptually (she accepts an unfinished, less marketable path), though it remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative ritual: preparation → song → arbor awakening → ancestral chorus → reconfigured world, with clear because/therefore links. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the land remembers and the songs become ambient, with Elara’s role complete and the wreath awaiting the next singer. The causal line is smooth but low-friction—there’s little sense of possible failure or adjustment once the ritual begins, so escalation feels more like inevitable unfolding than pressured choice. Still, orientation is impeccable and the ending has a legible before/after with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: a ritual progresses stepwise until the plate activates and the “map drawn in pulses” vision lands as closure. Causality is coherent (arranging objects → sealing with blood → plate glowing → inner vision), and the before/after (world holding vs resuming breath; map dormant vs alive against her ribs) is legible with conceptual cost. Stakes remain largely conceptual—no explicit consequence if she fails—so the closure, while resonant, lacks harder-edged jeopardy. Still, the final charged poise as she leaves with the living map reads structurally sound and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens cleanly, building a coherent sequence from arrival in the wounded season through the completion of the archive to the distant-future travelers. Causality is soft but clear: he studies, experiments, builds, then leaves, and the payoff is the later effect on strangers who feel the preserved echoes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the broken timer becomes a “fulcrum,” the archive a “larder for the soul,” and we understand the cost in time, solitude, and the unchanged ruined village. Structural risk (lyric, low-plot) is controlled; everything orbits the same drive without fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrival → ritual → partial relief → quiet aftermath, then a brief self-applied reprise that lands as closure. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: because he comes and because of her practice, the burden calcifies, and that process conceptually reconfigures her own stance in the final beat. The closure as Earned Stasis is clear—the path of escape is foreclosed in favor of endurance with cost. There are no major orientation or logic slips, though the emotional turn for her at the end is more implied than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-scene frame (the loft, while the kettle boils) with interleaved reflection that always re-anchors in present sensory cues. The drive lens is accumulative/textural: pressure builds not by events but by progressively reframed images of time, performance, and containment, culminating in the act of placing the lion on the sill. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief is reconceived from drowning force to something studied and held, with cost in the refusal of everyday duties and acceptance of enduring pain. Causality is coherent and orientation never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: wandering and collecting fragments → encounter with the child’s lullaby → ghost’s correction → climb to the spire and camera exchange → envelope revelation. Causality holds even in a lyric mode: using the camera on the ghost leads to the click and the drawer opening, which delivers the conceptual reframe. Closure is strong and legible as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she abandons fixing the past in favor of framing it, and regret’s grip changes. The time-pooling conceit is thematically charged but never disorients basic who/where/what.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: orientation is fast, then we move through discovery (the geothermal leak), experimentation (redirecting flows), and social response (locals returning), culminating in a conceptual closure with the hope equation. Causality is intact and legible: she comes to reconfigure the terminal, finds an unexpected resource, redirects it, and that shift alters the space’s use. The closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing: hope is reframed in technical terms that reweight all prior images. The main limitation is the relative absence of setbacks or complications that would deepen the sense of structural or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: daily ritual → disruption (crystal) → integration into the sanctuary → inner reconfiguration and hum. Causality holds—the clocks soften after the crystal arrives; the droplet on the score and the tuning fork beat logically into the closing realization. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: he redefines his relationship to the abandoned dream with felt cost. A touch more explicit tension about what resuming music might risk to his current life would heighten the structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative, single-scene structure where attention, waiting, and small physical actions (opening the sundial, choosing when to reach) build steadily toward the discovery of the locket and the reframing realization. Closure lands cleanly as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he alters his drive from pursuing legends to honoring the “quiet ruins” of misremembered truths, with the cost being a relinquished heroic frame. Causality is subtle but coherent—his training leads to watching rather than grabbing, which allows the glint/sundial alignment and the salvaging of the locket. No major orientation or lens-clarity issues emerge, though the story leans on reflection more than event.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival, offering, test of patience, initiation into the knot-language, then a parting that reconfigures her mission. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the slow build of knots, stories, and shared silence coheres toward the “I’m collecting hands” turn and the promise to return. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, not a decisive plot turn, but the before/after (seeds → hands, searching → apprenticed) is legible with a conceptual cost. Causality is simple but intact; there are no orientation issues or broken setups.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by a taught pattern of “after the last ship” and the ritual of obituary-writing, culminating in the Elira piece and its burial. Causality is modest but coherent: Elira’s departure → the traveler’s choice to write her obituary → the crane and its placement as charged closure. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the traveler’s mapping practice is reaffirmed as their form of action in a world of absences, with cost in their chosen solitude. What keeps this from a higher band is the relative lack of a noticeable mid-story tightening or structural turn beyond deepening description.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: setup of a ruined world and his vow, development through the intricate preparation, and a clear tightening into the activation scene. Causality is coherent—his hypothesizing and construction directly lead to the hum, fissures, and environmental shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: beauty has unmistakably stirred, but the egg’s future remains uncertain, which supplies a conceptual and emotional cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently to the final charged-poise image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—present ritual interleaved with key backstory beats—holds cleanly under a textural lens and remains anchored in one continuous scene. The drive from “coin in her palm” to “coin under the lagoon, song continuing without her” yields a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: she converts private legacy-pain into an ongoing, externalized practice. Causality is coherent (father’s gift → knowledge of fire → choice of profession → lagoon ritual), and the radio call provides a grounded exit beat without feeling tacked on. Cost is quieter than it might be but legible in her commitment to return and to keep carrying both fire work and emotional tending.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the frozen-moment city → method of breadcrumbs → concrete test at Fountain Twelve → release of memories → charged, reweighted silence and the first fountain drop. Causality is legible and coherent under a textural lens, and the closure unit is strong—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city’s forgetting is conceptually repriced as a failure now being rectified. Stakes (collective memory vs oblivion) remain mostly conceptual, but the sequence of actions (finding key, opening box, memories returning, moving to Fountain Thirteen) gives clear forward motion. No orientation or lens-clarity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is clean: we move from solitary keeper + heirloom → sonar pings and empathic feedback → gear’s transformation and a reconfigured pattern. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: generational light is no longer synonymous with fire, embodied in the gear’s new function as “a lighthouse without flame.” Causality is soft but coherent within the lyric frame; each move flows logically from the prior one. The main weakness is the relatively low felt cost—fragility of peace is mentioned but minimally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens: greenhouse work, butterflies, poems, ribbons, and Silas gradually layer toward a conceptual shift about grief. Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and stable, and the spectral mentorship’s emergence during migration is well-timed. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: “grief was not a void to be filled, but a current to be joined,” reweighing all prior craft and ritual with palpable lineage-cost. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with reflective braids; while comparatively low on causal turns, it coheres and lands its ending cleanly for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: a single present-tense climb to the pendulum framed by one backstory shard (finding the inscription) that clearly motivates the central choice. Causality is sound: wife’s words → reevaluation of vow → choice to let the pendulum pause → altered stance as he descends. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis rather than a decisive external event, but the before/after is legible and comes with an emotional cost (relinquishing his controlling absolution). The drive lens is accumulative/textural and holds consistently, though escalation is more in depth than in new complications.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: cemetery → descent into silo → encounter with tapestry → return to surface with a reconfigured stance, forming a clear before/after. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent: her established tending leads to the call of the silo, which leads to the tapestry work, which yields the realization that reweights graves as thresholds. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the comfort of her prior, orderly relationship with the dead is surrendered in favor of a more unsettling, interrogative stance. A slightly sharper hinge or explicit consequence at the chess-clock moment could further tighten the sense of narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece functions as a single accumulative scene, coherently anchored in time and place, building toward the moment the pen meets the parchment and the spire responds. Causality is soft but legible: reflection on prior failures leads to a different tactic (questions/invitations), which in turn awakens the parchment and spire. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the world has subtly shifted, conceptually and literally, by the final pulse. Escalation is modest and primarily textural, so the sense of before/after is more intellectual than dramatically pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: famine → secret listening practice → increasingly intense signals → personal invocation (“about her”) → transformation into broadcaster. Causality is coherent within the lyric premise: pirate songs unlock dust-memories; tears complete the circuit; she decides to answer back. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the network of “scattered, silent scribes” reframes prior broadcasts and her own labor, and her first transmission changes her options going forward. The cost is primarily emotional and existential (exposure, mourning, commitment) rather than dramatized danger, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: rocking chair → ritual → visitor’s reaction → quiet closing image. Causal logic is intact (she begins the ritual as the chair stops; the powder’s application precedes the visitor’s recognition), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration in which she consciously sustains truth over safety. The dominant stake—whether fragile emotions are preserved or erased—is coherent, though it operates largely at a conceptual rather than situational level. A slightly more tangible pre/post shift in her options or stance under pressure would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is accumulative rather than strongly causal, but it’s coherent: descent, cataloging, envoy visits, bell-tower ritual, then the obelisk-vs-sundial ending. The drive lens is clear (Accumulative/Textural) and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: depth vs height, sediment vs steel, memory vs erasure. Cost is conceptual but present—his chosen isolation and marginalization are clear, even if not dramatized in a specific turning-point scene. Orientation is excellent; no penalties for confusion or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: present-tense stillness in the library, deepened by reflective passages about vanished arts and former students, culminates in the small but decisive arrival of a new student. The drive lens is textural/accumulative, and the final beat—Elara choosing to begin again with this child—lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the cost of her long waiting is legible in “showing up even when no one clapped.” Causality is modest but coherent: she comes for silence, recommits by humming, which invites the creak and then the voice, and her answer reconfigures the situation. It’s not a high-plot piece, but for its scale the closure is clean and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: pruning → seeding → sprouting → dawn reconfiguration, with each step logically arising from the last. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the celestial alignment plus librarian’s charge frame the night as a unified narrative window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the greenhouse’s function shifts from ruin to living archive, and Elara’s role crystallizes. The cost is mostly conceptual and quiet rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this shy of the 8.5+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: woman arrives with a riddle, Elias recognizes the implication, reciprocates with a matchbox, and they ascend to confirm the transformed bees, culminating in the “belief not lightning” repricing. Orientation is immediate and solid, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: what seemed like infrastructural failure becomes evolution, and the tower’s true function is reframed with a subtle social cost (the city remains ignorant). The only thing keeping this from a higher band is the relatively low on-page pressure around that cost—no one seriously contests or challenges the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: walk → arrival at bay → ritual → sensed response of the houses → departure, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vanished cottage “unclenches,” and her ongoing practice is conceptually reweighted as necessary care rather than eccentricity. The cost is subtle—emotional labor and solitary vigilance more than a concrete sacrifice—but it is legible. Stakes and options remain modest throughout, keeping this just short of top-tier structural urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → discovery of ampoule → revelation of city’s true fate → decision to break the ampoule → garden and statue transform → new mission. Causality is strong under a largely causal/accumulative lens; each revelation directly motivates the next action, culminating in her decision to surface and reframe history. Closure lands as a decisive change in knowledge and purpose with conceptual cost (burden of nuance, loss of statue). The only limitation is that the conflict remains mostly epistemic, so the stakes never quite feel pressured beyond the contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: climb → experiments with rest and proofs → intensified use of proofs → space-rupturing proof → reconfigured stance. Causality within the lyric frame holds (his actions with equations lead to the ripple and vision), and the closure—losing the die after touching the reflection—lands with conceptual and emotional cost. Orientation is intentionally abstract but legible from early on and doesn’t impede closure. The pressure line could be marginally sharper if one moment more concretely narrowed his options before the climactic proof.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: the story teaches its pattern of glyph → distant act of kindness → small proof, then tightens toward the specific Vaelish glyph and culminates in the girl’s appearance and shared painting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the solitary mission becomes communal, reweighting the premise of “remembered kindness.” Causality is soft but legible within the magical-real frame (brush → resonance → barista, billboard glyph → girl arriving); there are no orientation or logic breaks. The main limitation is that the cost of this reconfiguration (what is lost or risked by being “found”) is only implied, not sharply articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is accumulative rather than tightly causal, but beats progress coherently from isolation and silence to collective artistic rebirth. The bread ritual and emerald lens create a clear throughline, with the boy’s drum performance functioning as a pivotal turning point that reconfigures what is possible. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s role shifts from refuge to renaissance, and art moves from elegy to inheritance with a tangible before/after. The beekeeper frame is slightly under-integrated—his absence invokes mood more than plot—keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is strong: arrival at low tide → descent → application of yoyo core and mainspring to the hunger stone → paradoxical gear → world-scale reversal with personal cost. Structure is cleanly single-threaded, with backstory about the yoyo anchored to present action and paying off directly in the climax. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: time’s rules are altered, famine unwritten, the stone and lighthouse partially destroyed, and his burden clarified. There are no orientation or logic slips; the drive lens (causal) holds from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: post-resuscitation haunting → deliberate entry into the funhouse → advisor’s guidance → dream dictionary incantation → unbosoming → confrontation with Fear → exit at dawn. Structure is single-scene with light backstory and no orientation debt; the drive lens reads as primarily causal with strong textural layering. Closure is decisive: the protagonist reconfigures their relationship to Fear, which dissolves, at genuine emotional cost. No major setups are abandoned, and the dictionary/“lingering luminance” payoff is integrated into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: cloud-reading → sound-tide omen → musical manipulation of waves → sea darkening → fruit percussion → Kael’s decisive strike and harmonic rain. Causality within the magic system holds well (sounds alter sea and sky, escalating to a pattern-breaking climax), and the single-scene continuity is clean. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: apprentice steps into power, the algorithm of the clouds is altered, and the tide turns inward conceptually. The main limitation is that the “cost” of success feels light and mostly aesthetic (Prophet’s exhaustion, shifted world-hum) rather than sharply foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is coherent: present-moment frame, layered backstory, then a clear culminating decision to confront the watchers, all under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is intact (new whistle pattern → watcher turns its head → she infers listening and silencing → decision to act), and the closure beat functions as Charged Poise with a visible implied cost. The main limitation is that the piece reads more like the prelude to the true expedition than a self-contained arc; we end on a charged intention rather than a tested action, which slightly softens the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: she uncovers the letter, understands its implications, and commits to a particular strategy for revealing it, with a clear before/after in her stance about how to proceed. The causal chain is simple but coherent, and the closure—her resolved plan and the charged final image of leaving the station—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. However, the piece leans heavily on reflection and projected future scenes (the book, the talks) rather than dramatizing turns under pressure. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with situational undertones, and while that works, it keeps escalation relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: each descent and inscription layers pressure until the keystone letter triggers a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is clean—she goes down to inscribe, repeatedly, until the pavilion “answers” with the copper tube and the inkwell’s exhaustion forces a transitional beat. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she redefines her role and commitment at cost (spent ink, emotional rupture, deeper binding to the drowned place). The structure is coherent and complete for its quiet, lyric aims; nothing essential feels missing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: investigative passes through the library build toward the discovery of deliberate erasure and the Master Index, which reconfigures her mission into testimony. Causality is steady—each clue prompts a new line of inquiry, and nothing important teleports or contradicts earlier facts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: she surfaces with a new, committed role as verifier of the buried record, with the blackout and the stamp charging the final image. The main limitation is that cost remains mostly conceptual; danger and opposition are implied rather than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure follows a clean accumulative arc: shadow detaches → retreat and preservation pattern → disturbance in the basilica’s hum → deliberate ritual climax in the nave → reconfigured aftermath. Causality is coherent even in the lyric register; each escalation (shadow climbing dreams, cranes carrying fragments, sapphire polishing) flows from the established mechanics. Closure is a genuine before/after: the shadow’s conversion into the crane and the sideways-drifting isle mark a Decisive Change with visible cost (the shattering of all preserved dreams). The pattern is taught early and paid off without orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: backstory → current experiment → new coordinates → decision to go, all under a single causal arc. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she commits the observatory to a new trajectory in explicit dedication to the dead, with cost in her isolation and self-endangerment. Causality is coherent and there are no orientation issues; the geode and simulations naturally motivate each step. The only limit is that external complications are minimal, so the central “because/therefore” chain feels somewhat friction-light.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece holds a clear accumulative structure: trespass → discovery → activation → visions → realization, with each stage deepening the initial premise of “frequency of belonging.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets the quest from decoding an external signal to recognizing an internal resonance, with the talismanic pocketing of the chip providing a concrete after-state. Causality is clean, and orientation (who/where/roughly when) is established early without confusion. The cost is quiet but legible—she forecloses her old self-conception as purely functional—and while that could be dramatized more sharply, it still satisfies the closure requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: terrace → shore → carvings → watch-triggered memory → reoriented vocation, all in a single continuous scene with clear causal links. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she can’t undo the past, but her understanding of her father and of truth’s handling is decisively repriced. The emotional and conceptual cost of that shift is on the page (physical revulsion, shaken legs, altered life-direction). There are no major orientation or lens issues; the accumulative/causal blend holds from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: waiting on the parapet, the prosecutor’s arrival, the confrontation over erased names, the exchange of relics, then a shared departure. Causality is modest but intact—her proposal of neutral ground brings him here; his choice to memorize the buried names and bring the key enables the “swapping ghosts” turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they leave not as enemies but in charged, tentative alignment, with a clear before/after in their relational stance. Stakes remain largely internal and symbolic rather than concretely tested, which keeps the structural pressure relatively low for elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: stuck at the launch → walk inland by poles → return to kayak and launch with a reconfigured stance. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each move arises from the last (utility poles as new stars → regained coherence → re-approach to the sea). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with the final act of paddling into the gloaming and the compass needle’s shift marking a legible before/after. Stakes remain internal and modestly scaled, but the core drive is never lost or contradicted.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: archives → descent → lake encounter → release → ascent, with each step causally linked and easy to follow despite the lyric mode. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, with the lake’s responses and images progressively reweighting the seeker’s goal until the closure choice to let the ball go and leave. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: they forego clinging to the time traveler’s promise and accept a costlier path of ongoing choices. A slight limitation is that the “rules” of the lake and the procedure remain intentionally sketchy, which works thematically but keeps the causal lens from feeling fully rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is clean: arrive at orchard → prepare/spend the spices → undergo metamorphosis → reforge the bond. Causality is clear and linear under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each sensory/magical step deepening pressure and leading to the phoenix’s return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits not just reunited but ontologically altered, with “footprints glowed briefly before fading—not into earth, but into story.” The cost—her partial transformation into something in-between—is legible and integrated, even if not framed as a painful dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clear: ritual in the glade → opening of the saucer → descent into the archive → blessing and release → return to the daughter. Each step follows the prior by emotional and mythic causality, and the closure—saucer healed, decision to re-engage with the living child—lands on the page with clear cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is elegantly handled early despite the elevated diction, and there’s no causality break. The final reconfiguration of options (from chasing lost seconds to choosing present time) is clean and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clear: ship + photos + Tear + emotional calibration → search for the Echo-Realm → finding the birthday photo → stitching the gate → crossing. The structure is essentially one compressed build to a single decisive act, with world-rules explained early enough that the climax feels earned. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she actually opens and enters the Echo-Realm, foreclosing solitary endurance in the material world. Some rule exposition is delivered in summary rather than through attempts/complications, which slightly flattens what could be an even more pressurized middle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each bottle release is a beat that deepens consequences, culminating in the personal stake of the fourth bug and the final HERE.NOW.YOU trail. The thrift-store backstory is efficiently woven and clarifies the premise without stalling present action. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she ends in a different stance—belonging and radiant—after relinquishing her unlived life, with a conceptual but legible cost. The causal logic is somewhat soft-focus (coincidences, divine bottling), yet consistent with the mythic lens and never confuses orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous operation from ramparts to courtyard to rooftop, with causal steps (blackout → opportunity → sundial alignment → dissemination). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: dawn and the imagined readers of the vellum reweight the prior preparation with future cost implied. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with light causality, and that pattern holds. What keeps it short of top-tier is the lack of a concrete complication or reversal that materially tests or alters her plan on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: friction’s disappearance → new eel behavior → deliberate experiment with rocks → contact with the star-dusted eel → conceptual shift at the end. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure (reframing of curse and promise into “method of asking better questions”) is on-page and legible. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, tied to a lifetime of frustration and the surrender of the fantasy of neat “answers.” Escalation is present but quiet; no major breaks, but pressure could tighten a notch more for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear anchors (who/where/what she’s doing), and a closure beat centered on the timer hitting zero and the decision not to reset or open the envelope. Causality is quiet but coherent: ritual → retrieval of the envelope → confrontation with possibility → chosen continuation of the pause. The closure is a solid Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid, with a legible before/after stance toward her own archive. Escalation is modest—more deepening than turning—which keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: waiting → arrival → tracking the sundial’s angles → applying the needle card → discovering the First Accord → deciding to disseminate it. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with tight temporal scaffolding (10:17, 11:03, noon), and the sundial/angle mechanism is clear and paid off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they shift from adversarial correspondents to partners on a shared mission, leaving the needle card behind as a completed tool. The main limitation is that the outcome never feels truly in doubt; there’s little sense of what might meaningfully go wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative arc: arrival at the library → reveal of Elias’s last poem → ritual acts (posting, reading, planting, singing) that reconfigure her relationship to grief and rebellion. Causality is coherent—each step grows naturally from the previous (the poem prompts the shedding of cynicism, which prompts planting and song). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a new stance while the poem and seeds remain as a charged future. Stakes and options are modest but clearly tightened by the end: she chooses to rebuild belief rather than retreat into vagrant detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story tracks cleanly from setup (refuge, motivation, rules) through escalation (compasses, ticking clock, film instructions) to a decisive climax and charged aftermath. The causal chain—music affects physics, film reel gives directive, her playing alters time and horizon—is coherent within the established rules. Closure is solid: reality reconfigures and her lover’s presence shifts from absence to implied return, with the cost of burning her last instructions and breaking equilibrium. The only slight limitation is that the exact stakes of failure (beyond continued loss) remain more implied than concretely pressured in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: early bloom → urgency → ritual with Elira → tremor and activation → autonomous archive. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the single knowledge seed becomes a self-correcting living library, changing the island’s future options at visible conceptual cost (the last seed consumed). The global drive (prevent cultural erasure before monsoon) is clear and resolved on the page, with no orientation problems. The main limitation is that the ritual proceeds without serious complication or tactical adaptation, so escalation feels smooth rather than sharply contoured.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: compass → islet → ritual → color → diffusion → calm, with clear because/therefore linkages under a textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the island’s sorrow is lightened, the compass calms, and Elio’s practice is validated with a tangible change in the world. Stakes and cost remain conceptual and externalized into the environment, which keeps the piece from a higher score in such a competitive context. Still, the narrative drive never wavers, and the ending cadence feels earned and complete.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story violates the single-scene/two-shard scope default, summarizing "years" of action rather than dramatizing a specific crisis. It reads like a synopsis or montage, lacking the immediate causal pressure required for a short story in this band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    Structure is legible, but the climax relies on an unearned coincidence: a natural frost pattern perfectly mimicking a complex, specific coded ledger entry ("Synchrony"). This breaks causal plausibility for a realistic narrative, resolving the central mystery through luck rather than agency or logical discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is a linear Accumulative procedural: arrival, explanation of method, testing, and successful expansion. While the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (silence recontextualized as music), the middle section relies heavily on expository summary of the "heat-mapping" science rather than dramatized struggle, reducing narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (distress to belonging), but the narrative arc relies on a convenient "dream" instruction to bridge the conflict and resolution. This bypasses the necessary "trial and error" phase of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Each night," "decades of prayer") rather than specific dramatized scenes, which distances the reader from the crisis. While the closure—passing the bell to the community—is logically sound, the lack of immediate scenic pressure or a distinct inciting incident within the timeline softens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path from observation to epiphany, fitting an Accumulative lens. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (redefining the nature of unused love), but the transition from the camera obscura to the breathing technique feels like convenient tool-switching rather than a causal progression, and the stakes remain low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from observation to rupture to reconfiguration. While the "hyperbolic geometry" explanation functions as a slightly convenient magic system, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where loss is accepted as the price of sensory truth—lands with distinct, irrevocable change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear success path with minimal complication; the puzzle is solved instantly without trial or error. Causal logic regarding the raiders is weak—if they dragged her to this specific hidden vault location, their convenient disappearance to allow her solitary work feels contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative operates on a consistent dream-logic where metaphors (burning absences) function as physics, creating a cohesive Accumulative/Textural drive. The transition from forging to the "crack" of discovery is effectively paced, though the success feels inevitable rather than earned through a specific on-page tactical pivot. Closure is distinct (departure with the device), providing a clear change in status.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure is episodic and low-stakes, consisting of two successful interventions without rising action or complication. The narrative relies on a "magic wand" device (the jar) to instantly resolve the central tension of the scene. Closure is soft and lacks the required cost; the protagonist exits unchanged and unchallenged, resulting in a vignette rather than a dramatic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path (Accumulative Lens) where a task is proposed and completed without complication or meaningful deviation. The closure relies on a projected future (a child finding the sphere) rather than an immediate, on-page cost or consequence, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels like a "gift" rather than a narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is legible—the reel is burned—but the narrative drive is hampered by a heavy backstory dump (~25% of the text) that explains the stakes rather than showing them. The causality is weak; the plot hinges on the contrivance of a villain who meticulously documents his crime and leaves the evidence for the hero to find due to "slow guilt," which dissolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building a mood that resolves into a clear conceptual closure. However, the narrative is static, lacking distinct beats or causal turns that ratchet pressure beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative drive lens functions well, using the loops to layer meaning until the climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the melting violin and the new stance), though the pivot relies on a slightly convenient memory retrieval rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path: setup, execution, and immediate success. The resolution relies on a symbolic "magic feather" (the lens) to instantly dissolve deep-seated mistrust, lacking the causal friction or setbacks required for a satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clear Accumulative structure, layering the marble ritual before the intern's arrival tests it. Orientation is solid, and the ending lands a resonant "Earned Stasis" where she refuses to yield. The pacing is somewhat front-loaded with exposition, compressing the actual confrontation into a brief exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scene follows a clear causal arc, but the closure feels unearned due to the lack of visible cost. The resolution—a simple lever adjustment based on instinct—fixes the fracture too easily, leaving the protagonist fundamentally unchanged and safe by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks a meaningful turning point or "felt cost." The progression (arrive, decode, play, resolve) encounters no obstacles; the ghost is cooperative, and the closure—a "gift" of purpose—feels unearned by sacrifice or struggle. The logic of the "37 degrees" (angle or temperature?) is momentarily confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from paralysis to a decisive physical action (pinning the illustration) that serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost—the destruction of her work—anchoring the emotional realization in the physical world.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    The climax relies on a causality break: a "corroded" radio physically playing a specific past broadcast in a tunnel is mechanically impossible without supernatural aid, yet the protagonist concludes the experience is "not haunted." This contradiction undermines the skeptic's arc and the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic, effectively using the origami swan as a threshold device to structure the journey. However, the closure relies on a declared internal shift ("softened like wax") rather than a demonstrated change in behavior or circumstance, lowering the sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on a massive coincidence (the unannounced eclipse) to drive the climax, robbing the protagonist of agency in creating the central moment of wonder. The closure—passing the curl—is symbolic but lacks a decisive, earned change derived from the protagonist's struggle against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent and linear, moving from discovery to realization, but the causal links rely on convenient assertions ("Match. Match again.") rather than struggle. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) works well to shift the paradigm from collecting to mending, but the "tomorrow" deferral softens the immediate on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and anecdotal montage rather than a dramatized causal chain. The ending arrives via coincidence (the stranger's arrival) rather than protagonist agency, and the resolution lacks the required visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, logical arc within its surreal premise, moving cleanly from setup to rhetorical escalation to a decisive conceptual turn. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's realization recontextualizes the threat, though the pivot relies heavily on abstract logic.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulation of pressure through the ritual is well-structured, leading to a decisive environmental change (the lake cracking). The "before exhaustion hits" rule provides functional constraints, though the "fortune cookie" backstory feels more like a thematic wrapper than a causal driver of the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is legible and structurally sound, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist integrates her fractured selves. However, the narrative progression feels mechanical, driven by a linear sequence of generated encounters rather than escalating causal pressure. The "procedural" framing risks making the plot feel like a tour rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from the inciting numbness to the experimental climax. The reconfiguration of the classroom dynamic serves as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong, linear causality flows from the inciting incident (finding the tube) to the closure (leaving safety). The inciting object effectively disrupts the status quo, and the closure—a threshold crossing with the cost of abandoned safety—lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but is disrupted by a significant artifact: the required phrase "As the transformation completes" appears twice (once in the middle, once at the end), breaking the structural flow. Closure arrives via a realization stated in the exposition rather than through a decisive change in action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magic sermon" ending where a complex social conflict is resolved instantly by a speech, bypassing earned causality. The climax lacks a decision with visible cost; the village’s sudden conversion is automatic and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story functions well under an Accumulative/Lyric lens, successfully building atmospheric density until the child's appearance shifts the energy. Closure is achieved through the Resonant Reconfiguration of the "chronic hush" from oppressive to sacred. However, the lack of felt cost or difficult choices keeps the narrative arc relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is excellent, featuring a Decisive Change (dealer to conduit) with clear social and financial costs ("market will call her ruined"). The causal chain from contact with the petal to the destruction of the inventory is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("The next morning," "The next week") rather than dramatized scenes, which flattens tension and violates the single-scene scope. Additionally, the logistics of commissioning and receiving five custom engravings overnight creates a significant credibility gap that undermines causality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid, building clearly from isolation to the closure of "Resonant Reconfiguration" where she joins the web. However, the lack of significant obstacles or "felt cost" makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned; the victory is smooth and lacks the texture of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident and a logical progression of beats leading to a decisive change (the bird becomes real). The climax—borrowing from the giant's dreams—is a strong escalation that resolves the central tension, though the "soft" reaction of the giant mitigates the sense of danger slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure without significant obstacles; the resolution (a magical projection providing the answer) feels convenient. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end works, the lack of a complication or cost paid on the page flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and low-friction; the resolution relies on a feedback loop where the protagonist is immediately validated by a warm note, removing narrative risk. While the orientation and causality are functional, the "cost" is negligible, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "behind on rent" stake is an unkept set-up that vanishes, undermining the reality of the resolution. Closure relies on magical validation to solve the conflict, functioning as a soft reset rather than a consequence of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure via the ritual exchange is distinct and carries a tangible cost (the painting and brush), fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the discovery of the journal functions as a "scroll of truth" that conveniently explains the magic system, the backstory, and the central concept ("convergence") in a single expository block, reducing the protagonist's agency in solving the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on the "Convenient Amnesia" anti-pattern; the inciting problem is resolved simply because a suppressed memory returns when needed, not through active problem-solving. While the acoustic mechanics of the cave act as a nice structural frame, the causality is weak, and the stakes dissolve when the pilgrim announces the forces are harmless.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on broad summary spanning years ("Each morning," "Years later") rather than dramatizing a specific scene with a concrete "now." This violates the short-story scope by failing to ground the reader in a singular, unfolding event with causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear drive with a coherent cause-and-effect chain leading to a legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The "phantom punch" mechanics are established well. The orientation is somewhat floaty ("starlit vault in mist"), relying heavily on dream logic, but the structural integrity holds together through the climax and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear Accumulative structure that flows smoothly but lacks a decisive causal turn or cost. The closure is a "gift" moment that feels resonant but safe; the lack of meaningful obstacles or distinct cost for the protagonist keeps the arc in a lower band of intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality is strictly maintained (storm enables amulet, amulet opens door). The structure is linear and somewhat procedural; the protagonist faces no significant complications or "no, and" setbacks, resulting in a smooth but low-tension progression to the decisive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative structure dissolves into a summary montage ("An hour passed... Others came") right when the scene should tighten, deflating specific tension in favor of a generalized list. The magical solution acts as a "fix-all" that bypasses causal struggle or logical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene default with a summary bridge (“spent days cross-referencing”) that dissipates the immediate tension of the discovery. While the closure (leaving the notebook) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, the structural drift into montage weakens the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres, using the tides and collection of debris to build texture. The closure (Earned Stasis) is legible under the textural lens, but the narrative arc is static; the ending feels like a soft release of tension rather than a decisive reconfiguration of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing a distinct "input/output" magic system to externalize internal change. The climax—shifting the ritual’s input to produce a new, destructive output—is a solid Causal turn. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned, even if the mechanics are slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story operates as a synopsis or montage rather than a dramatized narrative; it summarizes a sequence of events ("She paints... Corporate scouts arrive... Lira watches") over an indeterminate timeframe rather than grounding the reader in a single scene. The climax is narrated from a distance ("Lira doesn't show up... instead, she climbs") without immediate causal friction or on-page struggle. Closure is conceptual but feels unearned due to the lack of scenic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the timing of the climax (dawn) provides a solid structural spine. The closure—labeling the artifact—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration that lands the emotional beat. However, the middle section drags with heavy technical exposition ("sodium metasilicate") that slows momentum right before the key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear process sequence (diagnosis, repair, success) without a decisive turning point or incurred cost. While the "how" is described, the lack of a complication that forces a change in tactics or a sacrifice means the ending arrives as a "mission accomplished" moment rather than a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative functions well as a cohesive ritual with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (editing to witnessing). However, the progression is linear and lacks a moment of doubt or causal tightening; the outcome feels inevitable from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear ritual structure with legible orientation and cause-and-effect logic (Accumulative/Textural lens). The closure is resonant, delivering a "rebalanced" state and a tangible cost (the left-behind fork). The arc is smooth but lacks a sharp reversal or complication to test the protagonist's plan.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.6)
    Orientation is confused by the submersible/swimming continuity; she scrapes a vehicle against a pillar, then "kicks" and handles a vial without a legible exit transition. While the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the mechanics of a "scent" blooming underwater strain causality without a pre-established magical rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent under a Causal lens, but the setup regarding the "bodies" functions as a false flag that resolves unsatisfactorily; the transition from fearing the discovery of corpses to the revelation of "only light" lacks a causal bridge. The closure is strong emotionally (Charged Poise), but the plot mechanics driving the ticking clock are slightly disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution relies on a magical object transfer that instantly fixes the central conflict (the curse) without a logical causal chain or earned cost. The ending explains the "burden turned gift" in summary rather than demonstrating the price paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is linear and ritualistic, lacking causal resistance or complication; the closure functions as a "soft reset" where magic resolves the problem without a dramatized cost or structural consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure is complete and loops effectively to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where she becomes the compass, though the causal chain is weakened because the environment (roots) solves obstacles rather than the protagonist earning progress.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure functions as a vignette or a summary of a ritual rather than a causal story; it relies on iterative description ("She'd juxtapose," "Later, those fragments") instead of a specific scene with rising tension. There is no decisive change or turning point where the protagonist must deviate from her routine or pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary for pivotal moments, most notably the climax ("The coup came... but faltered"), which robs the story of immediate tension and dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure (Accumulative) leading to a legible moment of release. However, the closure relies on a "soft reset" where the letters dissolve and healing occurs without the previously established "felt cost" (memory loss), resulting in a resolution that feels convenient rather than earned. The ending leans toward symmetric satisfaction, resolving the tension too neatly with an affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/lyric structure works for the dream-like premise, and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible. However, the "anesthetic" frame blurs the reality status, making the stakes feel low and the resolution somewhat convenient, operating on dream logic rather than causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to display, but the progression is linear with minimal friction; the elders provide the key instantly, and the machine works immediately. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing, though the cost is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a distinct "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the protagonist and world are altered. The causality is somewhat dreamlike/fable-based ("ricochet of intention"), which fits the tone but reduces mechanical solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story cleanly establishes the premise and orientation, but the structure dissolves from a dramatic scene into a summary montage halfway through. The climax (the gourd rattling) is projected into the future rather than dramatized on the page, lowering the immediate cost and impact. The shift from immediate action to hypothetical outcome weakens the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and backstory ("Fishermen claimed," "Years folded") rather than an unfolding present-tense scene. The climax—a magical update to the postcard—arrives as an external reward for endurance rather than a turn driven by the protagonist’s active choice or error, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative structure, establishing the ritual and executing a specific iteration that serves as closure. The ending functions well as Earned Stasis, reaffirming her vow, though the narrative arc is stable and lacks a sharp causal turn or significant complication to test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is sound and the concept of "musical legalism" drives the plot logic effectively. The resolution, however, feels linear; the choir succeeds on the first attempt without a complication or pivot, making the victory feel slightly unearned despite the theoretical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality relies on a tenuous leap (glue analysis leading to a specific volcanic tier) and a convenient magical resolution (humming reveals equations). While the ending works as a conceptual shift, the lack of established ground rules makes the solution feel unearned and the "envelope" backstory feels contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.0)
    The plot relies heavily on the convenient discovery of the magic meteorite in the protagonist's own attic to drive the narrative arc. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the attic from archive to transmitter) is legible, the causality is soft, with the central problem resolved primarily by the introduction of a magical object rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates on dream logic, which excuses some causal looseness, but the specific mechanism of decoding a weather log using wood grain patterns strains credibility even within this frame. The connection feels forced to bridge disparate prompt elements. Closure is achieved through a "dissolve into light" trope, which functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks a gritty, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear descent-and-return structure, but the closure relies on a "magical rescue" (fireflies forming a hand) rather than protagonist agency. This externalizes the resolution, offering symmetric satisfaction without the requisite pressure or causal cost to make the change felt.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and situational, relying on a "walk-through" progression where the protagonist observes rather than acts to force a turn. The resolution arrives via a vision granted by the crater glass rather than through active deduction or sacrifice, making the closure feel given rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is coherent, following a clear accumulative arc from setup to performance to aftermath, and the orientation is immediate. However, the closure—a quiet moment of stasis—lacks a strongly felt cost or decisive reconfiguration; the linear progression of successful tricks renders the ending pleasant but dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is linear and coherent, but the resolution relies on the coincidental arrival of the villagers to validate the protagonist rather than a consequence of the scene's immediate action. The mechanics of writing a "cosmic verse" on skin remain abstract, creating a disconnect between the physical action (dancing) and the claimed result (rewriting the world).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece functions as an atmospheric vignette or character sketch rather than a story; there is no inciting incident, rising action, or decisive change. The ending is a continuation of routine without a legible cost or reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with weak causality; the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual, and leaves feeling better without encountering a complicating obstacle. Closure is a soft emotional reset ("lighter now") that feels unearned by on-page struggle or cost, relying on the completion of the ritual to resolve the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure—a ritual of launch, observation, and adjustment—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cascade). While the closure is legible, the causal link between the specific "kelp pattern" and the "obsidian disc" feels somewhat arbitrary (magic-system procedural) rather than driven by a pressured narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear mood piece (enter, listen, read, sketch, leave) with insufficient causal tension. While closure occurs via the offering of the sketch, the lack of obstacles or escalating pressure makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual sequence where the protagonist succeeds exactly as intended without facing causal complications or unforeseen obstacles. The ending acts as a "soft reset" where she vanishes unscathed, lacking the decisive change or paid cost required for resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is linear but lacks causal tension; the resolution is unearned, relying on a "magic speech" moment where deep historical grievances dissolve instantly. The ritual succeeds because the author asserts it does, not because a difficult process was dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration ("felt clean"). However, the resolution relies on a sudden shift to magical realism (glowing cracks, singing earth) that isn't established in the corporate-dystopian setup, functioning as a convenient device to force closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative logic ("unraveling threads"), but causality is dream-like and abstract. The resolution relies on a "magic word" ("I remember you") to dissolve the central obstacle without establishing why that specific key worked or costing the protagonist anything.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure effectively manages the timeline, using the dome as a frame for flashbacks that inform the present decision. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the decision to return with a new, risky method), and the causal chain from the "story stick" epiphany to the resolution is coherent under a Causal/Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative drive works well to structure the ritual, and the closure (the monarch’s arrival and her departure) is legible and thematically coherent. However, the narrative lacks causal friction or orientation hurdles; the progression is smooth and linear, devoid of obstacles that would test the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, but the specific mechanics of the "lost wax" process are muddled; pouring bronze directly onto wax without mentioning an investment mold would result in failure, and the survival of the rope core (which ends up on the wrist) contradicts its placement inside the casting. This technical haziness weakens the causal chain of the craft-centered plot.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic to bridge the gap between inciting incident and resolution, bypassing causal friction. The ending—where the bunker collapses conveniently after the epiphany—feels teleological and unearned, resolving the plot through symbolic fiat rather than structural consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building effectively toward the ritual's success. The closure ("Confirmed") provides Earned Stasis, validating his life's work with intellectual satisfaction. While functional, the linear progression lacks significant causal friction or unexpected turns, resulting in a predictable if satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the melody is internalized. However, the progression is linear and relies on the "magic" of the music box/cellular memory to bridge the gap between conflict and resolution without significant external friction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without a meaningful turn or cost paid in the present moment. The climax resolves too smoothly ("It did not resist," "It flowed into the mirror"), robbing the story of narrative drive and reducing the ending to a simple completion of a task. The referenced cost ("weight of her task") remains abstract and physical (trembling hands) rather than a felt consequence of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from the setup of the magical orchard to the specific climax of retrieving the hostile vow. The closure (the green ribbon) serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, offering earned hope without unearned total reconciliation. The dream sequence transitioning to physical evidence is a slight causal softener, but fits the fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from bewilderment to a specific inquiry and resulting epiphany. The bathroom scene functions effectively as the pivot (the "method"), grounding the abstract quest in a concrete action. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear conceptual shift, though the opening of the cameo shell relies on convenient timing rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to a conceptual pivot ("renegotiation"). Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration, but the mechanism—the lexicon literally manifesting a sentence that heals the chrono-core instantly—feels like a convenient "magic fix" that bypasses mechanical causality. The shift from rescue to reconciliation is satisfying but frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear, guiding the reader through the ship to the specific goal. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing her imprisonment as choice, though the lock-and-key mechanism with the card feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure is tidy and symmetric (the clock is fixed, the door vanishes), failing the "felt cost" requirement for high-band literary fiction. The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path without the causal complications or sacrifices that generate genuine narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The plot progression is clean and logical, moving linearly from the inciting entry to the resolution. However, the climax resolves too easily; the "largest energy being" is pacified by a simple gesture without a complication that forces a shift in tactics. The lack of a decisive reversal or unforeseen obstacle makes the victory feel procedural rather than earned through narrative struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is solid under an Accumulative lens, effectively building density through the ritual to a Resonant Reconfiguration ("receiver," not "guide"). The pacing is smooth, though the lack of palpable resistance makes the arc feel more like a demonstration than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative lyric structure is coherent, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of her own erasure—lands with clear logic. However, the narrative progression is static and lacks dynamic turns, relying heavily on the final realization without significant prior complication.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative structure works well, building steadily from entry to the resonant reconfiguration at the climax. The causality of the "chromatic algorithm" is established early, allowing the magical realism of the ending to land. The closure is legible and costly (the loss of the rag knot), though the progression feels somewhat inevitable due to a lack of obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) is legible and effectively framed by the companion's arrival and the shared pause. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds well, using the sensory details of the grotto to earn the final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a late-breaking magical convenience ("falling sideways through a fold in the sky") to resolve the life-or-death stake of gravity returning. This deus ex machina undermines the physical rules established by the inciting incident and softens the cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clean vignette structure with a legible shift in the passenger's state (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the resolution relies on environmental "magic" (chime-trees, waterfall) rather than protagonist agency or causal turns, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear video-game logic: find wall, peel paint, get coordinates, go to tree, use key. There is little causal complexity or deviation; obstacles are resolved immediately by the tools she already possesses (the ruby flake), reducing narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.5)
    Closure lands as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (the release of the doorknocker and the threshold), but the narrative functions as a static ritual rather than a causal progression. The "Orientation Test" is strained by a setting that remains purely symbolic, and the lack of obstacle-driven turns flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident leads logically to the climax, but the progression is linear with low resistance. The resolution lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of a significant micro-turn or complication makes the journey feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.0)
    The structure relies heavily on a convenient "talking object" (the cylinder) that delivers a complete expository explanation of the mystery. This bypasses active investigation or deduction, resolving the central tension through a passive info-dump rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear ritual enactment with no meaningful obstacles; the environment and magic yield to the knight immediately, lacking a "Decisive Change" born of struggle. The "reality shifts" act as convenient transition markers rather than causal complications, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is coherent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the investigation relies on a tenuous link where dust patterns physically narrate history ("ghost of a hand"), which strains credibility in a realistic setting. The resolution with the supervisor is a "soft reset," resolving potential conflict immediately with coffee and acceptance, lacking visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the primary obstacle (the hatch) is conveniently "not locked," removing necessary friction. Closure represents a generic win state without the required "felt cost" or sacrifice; the protagonist succeeds perfectly and vanishes, leaving the stakes feeling theoretical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, moving efficiently from setup to a resonant closure (erasure of the prophecy). The logic of the magic system is sustained, and the ending—a vanishing that silences the code—provides a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost (existence).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("From that day," "One dawn") rather than a continuous scene, violating the scope default. This distancing effect removes immediate causal pressure, reducing the climax to a chronicled event rather than a lived crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, but the tension dissolves significantly after the climax. The transition of "weeks or months later" summarizes the integration of his new worldview rather than dramatizing the difficulty of living it. The climax itself (reading a journal) is passive, and the return to the surface feels effortless, lowering the narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is excellent, with a decisive change (Internal Status: Mended) secured by a tangible cost (destruction of the unique coin). The narrative drive is coherent, using the ritual as a causal spine that holds the scene together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, successfully building from silence to integration. However, the progression is linear and lacks a moment of significant risk or reversal; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned, making the closure feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc under an Accumulative lens, moving from disorientation to a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" at closure. However, the progression feels somewhat linear and inevitable, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt before the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with convenient resolution; the magic works instantly and perfectly, removing risk of failure. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved exactly as intended, lacking the "felt cost" required for higher bands. Orientation is clear, but the lack of causal complication limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from investigation to discovery to acknowledgment. The closure (acknowledging the ghost) lands firmly under the established lens. The linear progression works, though the "weightless burden" cost is abstract and thematic rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is excellent; the "glitching" library offers a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo with clear conceptual cost. The causal chain from the frost pattern to the rupture and subsequent retrieval is tight and follows the established surreal logic perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure relies heavily on summary to establish the central breakthrough (the mirror method), which occurs in backstory rather than being dramatized on the page. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is conceptually strong, the lack of on-page obstacles—Voss arrives merely to agree—flattens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and firmly causal, moving from the stone's arrival to a resonant resolution. However, the climax relies on an explanatory epiphany ("He understood then...") that summarizes the logic rather than letting the action fully carry the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and linear, leading to a legible Decisive Change at closure (sealing herself in). However, causality relies on convenient magical mechanics—specifically the journal that is "legible only when wet"—which acts as a shortcut to resolution rather than a problem to be solved. The orientation and drive are stable, but the lack of obstacles makes the plot feel like a guided tour.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story breaks the short-story scope by shifting from a specific scene into a generalized summary ("Days later...") to force closure, dissolving the immediate tension of the storm. The inciting incident (GPS failure) is disconnected from the protagonist's goal (salvage, not navigation), creating a causal gap that leaves the opening hook unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative spans seasons and relies heavily on summary ("She spent three nights there," "Back beneath the pavilion"), violating the short story scope of focused scenes. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the mystery is solved and life becomes perfect, lacking the necessary cost or tension for a literary closure unit. The "months later" coda dissipates immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails the scope default (one continuous scene), functioning instead as a synopsis covering "decades," "one night," and a general "now." The narrative summarizes the parley process rather than dramatizing the pivotal interaction in real-time, robbing the climax of immediate causal pressure. The ending offers closure, but the path to it is a list of events rather than a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The fable-like structure works well with the Accumulative lens, effectively shifting the town's state. However, the resolution relies on a smooth, linear progression where the community accepts the change without friction or causal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving cleanly from ritual to realization to action (Decisive Change). The "forgotten memory" functions as a convenient key that unlocks the plot, which slightly undermines the sense of active agency until the final beat, but the closure lands with a tangible shift in the world.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly with the thawing atrium. However, the progression lacks causal friction; the acorn sinks "without resistance" and the solution works immediately, making the sequence feel inevitable rather than earned through trial or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the bell ringing correctly) lands with a clear sense of &quot;Restored Trust&quot; (Conceptual Repricing). The orientation is solid, though the linear &quot;setup-wait-success&quot; structure lacks a moment of genuine jeopardy or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks a strong causal spine; the arrival of the comet is a coincidence that validates the protagonist's existing philosophy rather than challenging it. Closure is achieved through "Earned Stasis" (he keeps sweeping), but the lack of an obstacle or meaningful cost makes the resolution feel like symmetric satisfaction rather than a hard-won peace.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies heavily on habitual summary ("Each morning, she knelt," "At dusk," "When storms came") rather than a specific, unfolding scene, which distances the reader from immediate causality. The climax ("And when, one twilight") arrives very late and happens *to* the protagonist via the ghost's action, rather than being driven by her own agency, resulting in a passive resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where the protagonist’s goal is achieved without meaningful resistance or cost. The closure relies on a "soft reset" (heartbeat returning, capsule fixing itself) and an explanation of the mechanics, rather than a reconfiguration of stakes that demands a trade-off. The ending feels structurally inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with soft causality; the "drake's feather" acts as a prop for wisdom rather than a mechanical or sacrificial tool (she appears to retain it at the end). While the closure (boy accepts the imperfect kite) is legible, the resolution feels inevitable and low-stakes, lacking a decisive turning point that demands a price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Villagers came sometimes") and a montage-like span of six months, violating the short story's need for scenic compression. The drive is linear and inevitable, lacking a decisive structural turn or causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ascent-realization-descent structure creates a coherent situational arc, and leaving the amber provides a legible, cost-laden closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story succeeds as a lyric vignette with a clear Accumulative drive, building texture rather than causal tension. The closure functions well as Earned Stasis, though the narrative lacks a sharp turn or deepening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the central journey ("led them east... Inside, they found"), reducing the climax to a logistical arrival without struggle. Causality hinges on the unexplained magical ability of a dog to visually read audio grooves, which breaks the established realistic texture of the scrapyard setting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causality of "witnessing grants peace" feels convenient and lacks mechanical setup. The narrative is linear and low-stakes, moving from observation to observation without significant pressure or on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path, but the resolution relies on "dream logic" assertion (swapping pieces instantly fixes reality) rather than causal mechanism. The arc is frictionless; the protagonist encounters no setbacks or difficult choices, resulting in a closure that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure builds density effectively through the arrival of survivors, leading to a strong closure where the protagonist's refusal to bow constitutes a clear Conceptual Repricing. The ending lands with legible cost and reconfigures the power dynamic, though the middle section relies heavily on stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a ritual preparation to a transformative realization (Conceptual Repricing) with legible closure. The pacing is steady, and the transition from the "seventh sub-basement" to the "room of memory" is handled well via the magical logic. The causal link is symbolic/ritualistic rather than strictly mechanical, which fits the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.7)
    Causality is driven by symbolic logic rather than mechanism; the connection between her internal epiphany and the village unfreezing is asserted rather than structurally earned. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the world accommodates her emotional state, weakening the sense of narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is effective, moving cleanly from exposition of method to a specific case study (the child) and finally to the protagonist's own climax. Closure is decisive and resonant, utilizing the established magic system (refraction) to resolve the central conflict with a clear conceptual repricing of "purity."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.5)
    The resolution relies on a magical intervention (statue wakes and stabilizes the room) that disconnects the physical threat from the protagonist's specific actions, reading as a "magic feather" fix. While the pacing is competent, the causal link between the internal repair and the external salvation operates on dream logic rather than earned narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong causal arc with effective closure; the decision to leave the shell constitutes a Conceptual Repricing with clear cost (abandoning the symbol of permanent beauty). The "wrong turn" mechanism integrates cleanly into the plot progression.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on a "magic button" resolution: the conflict is solved instantly by a tool introduced for that exact purpose, bypassing causality and struggle. There is no "felt cost" to the resolution; the vial is simply opened, and the problem vanishes. This creates a symmetric satisfaction that lacks the necessary narrative friction for a literary ending.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story operates as a vignette or montage of habitual actions ("Last Tuesday," "Sometimes") rather than a distinct scene with a specific inciting incident and singular climax. The iterative structure ("And when the moon is full... she climbs") prevents the accumulation of immediate narrative pressure or a decisive change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the release of the eye, but the causality is fragile; the successful use of the tool in the climax makes its subsequent abandonment feel like an unearned authorial pivot rather than a character-driven necessity. The narrative leaps from reliance to "surrender" without a sufficient beat to justify why this specific encounter negated the need for protection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc resolves cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the tragedy, but the investigation relies on a convenient supernatural vision followed by a fortuitous file discovery. This "hand of god" plotting weakens the causal chain between the investigation method and the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on a "magic fix" ending where the protagonist's central grief is erased by a supernatural door without earned cost or logical causality. The narrative progression is linear and convenience-driven, lacking the friction or setbacks required for a satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is solid with a clear drive from the inciting dreams to the grotto. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (returning as witness), and the cost (scorching memory) is legible. The linear progression works well for the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands clearly, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical object (vial of liquid twilight) to solve an interpersonal betrayal. The causality is soft; the "revaluation" is asserted rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is legible under an accumulative lens, moving from resistance (fleeing the grave, blocked scroll) to integration (hunting past selves, filling the scroll). The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the chaos isn't gone, but the stance has shifted to "braiding" it. The transition to the "hunting" sequence is slightly abrupt and summary-heavy, but the final image of soaring "through" earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, with a clear situational drive and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara accepts a new mode of healing. The pacing is steady, though the transition from the shop to the street feels slightly abrupt as a vehicle for the immediate application of the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear, effective arc of ritual-as-plot, with the ink’s crystallization providing excellent causal pressure that forces the protagonist to change tactics (humming). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the scars remain but their meaning shifts. The narrative holds the "held breath" timeframe coherently from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a tense arrival to a resonant closure via the "miracle" mechanism. While the generator/coil setup is a rapid introduction of magical realism, it serves the emotional causality perfectly. The closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing: abandoning metaphors for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure is coherent as a ritualistic progression, and the closure (becoming the "hush") is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with high conceptual cost. However, causality relies heavily on abstract assertion ("The next phase required surrender") rather than grounded interaction, giving the plot a dream-logic procession feel rather than a driven story.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates as a beautifully detailed vignette or ritual rather than a narrative with causal momentum. The closure is a reaffirmation of the status quo (Earned Stasis) without a visible on-page cost, and the ending relies on explanatory summary rather than dramatic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, transforming the button from relic to key. The narrative lens holds specifically to the end, making the cost—the permanent dissolution of the mother's image—legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story relies heavily on summary montage ("She began noticing," "She learned to distinguish") rather than sustaining a specific, pressure-filled scene. While the frame narrative in the library works, the middle section compresses too much time and action into exposition, diluting the immediate tension required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure (vignettes of calls) transitions cleanly into the situational climax of the operator receiving her own call. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where she merges with the mechanism—is valid and logically earned within the established magical realist rules, though the shift from curator to participant is abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a static vignette rather than a driven story; the protagonist arrives, reflects, writes, and leaves without a decisive change in options or stakes. The "drive" is purely meditative, lacking the causal linkage or cost required for a higher score. Closure is a loop (a promise to return) rather than a reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well for this fable-like piece, building from a static setup to a specific interaction. Closure lands effectively with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the warmth of the hand vs. the magic of the rock). However, the middle section relies on summarized iterations ("It began with...", "Someone claimed...") rather than dramatized pressure, softening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure works well for a fable, leading cleanly to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she abandons the ring. However, the progression is linear and lacks causal friction; the obstacles are overcome immediately upon presentation, making the journey feel pre-ordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative suffers from "symmetric satisfaction," where complex problems (war, betrayal) are resolved instantly by magic without resistance or cost. The ending lacks a decisive change with felt price; the protagonist simply succeeds and leaves, rendering the closure unearned and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative operates as a static tableau driven by authorial fiat rather than causal pressure; the girl's arrival is a coincidental device to enable the lecture. The closure—a lesson learned immediately—lacks earned setup or the friction of a true process.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procession of low-resistance events rather than a causal plot; doors open and glyphs glow simply because the protagonist is present. The absence of obstacles ("No guards. No traps") flattens the arc into a ritualistic walkthrough. Closure is a symmetric satisfaction where destiny aligns perfectly, lacking the friction of genuine cost or error.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern where the protagonist's rebellion is immediately rewarded by the universe without complication. The ending achieves "wholeness" with no legible cost or tradeoff, rendering the closure unearned and tensionless.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the resolution relies on a "black box" transfer of information. It is unclear how refolding the map "seals" the audio evidence of the confession for Inspector Ruiz to find later; this gap in causality leans too heavily on the magical conceit to resolve the plot without showing the mechanism of proof.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but momentum stalls for expository blocks ("Her method?", "This was her action") that explain the magic system instead of dramatizing it. Closure lands as a functional Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative flows smoothly as a linear escalation of the premise, but the plot lacks a true crucible; the plan works perfectly on the first try and the second, with no complications. Closure is a "Charged Poise" of success, but without a felt price or a moment where the outcome was genuinely in doubt, the causality feels low-stakes and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a fable-like structure where a magical intervention resolves the central tension without a decisive, costly protagonist action. The ending dissolves into a summary montage of healing ("kissed the forehead," "mended a sail"), offering symmetric satisfaction that lacks the friction or cost required for a high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent structural integrity, moving efficiently from the inciting pressure of the mandate to a clear, resonant closure. The ending achieves a powerful "Earned Stasis," where the protagonist's successful deception cements their isolation, delivering a legible conceptual cost that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes sequence (enter, perform, exit) with no causal turns or reversals to generate narrative drive. The pivotal "obstacle"—the ban—is removed before the story begins, leaving the protagonist to move through a welcoming space without opposition. Closure is thematic summary rather than a dramatic change earned through on-page conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is strong, utilizing a clear Cause-and-Effect logic within the magical realism frame. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the "waking of the kiln" serving as a potent recontextualization of the premise. The inciting action (plant arrangement) pays off directly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative is a linear vignette (setup, ritual, success) that lacks a decisive turning point or structural tightening. While the "Accumulative" lens functions, the seamless success of the experiment means the closure—a thematic realization—feels unearned by narrative struggle or causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a static loop of procedure and validation without a decisive change or felt cost; the ending merely repeats the established pattern. The "climax"—a magical confirmation of her success via stirring curtains—resolves all ambiguity and tension, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story functions more as a conceptual vignette than a narrative with drive; the structure relies heavily on expository summary of her method before a brief final scene. While the "Accumulative" lens provides a coherent portrait, the lack of a "middle" testing phase or causal friction limits the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens; the protagonist’s specific counter-tactic (broken song) logically disrupts the machine’s function. Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change (release of atoms, change in strategy for daughter). The "telling" of the thematic conclusion in the final lines slightly softens the resonant impact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, following a clear investigation-realization-action path. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (planting the stone), but the lack of active obstacles or external resistance makes the plot progression feel linear and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece follows a clear Causal/Accumulative Hybrid path, using the repair task to organize memories. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (redefining the mission), but the lack of immediate, on-page opposition makes the scene feel static. The resolution relies on a "third way" plan that feels slightly too neat given the established constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible closure unit (the hourglass resuming flow). However, causality is soft; obstacles yield immediately via "invitation" rather than protagonist effort, reducing the narrative tension. The connection between the coffee rings and the specific location of the "miracle" relies on a convenient psychic pulse rather than a logical or earned deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean linear structure with a decisive closure act. However, the discovery of the letters in a hidden compartment relies on convenient tropes rather than causal pressure, slightly weakening the plot's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Structure is functional and linear, moving clearly from context to crisis to resolution with legible closure (Rest). However, causality is driven by magical assertion rather than tactical choice; the climax resolves the problem through the character's standard operating procedure rather than a hard-won adaptation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear path with a legible closure unit (the clock begins to tick, signaling a Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the causal chain is frictionless; the protagonist succeeds in his task immediately upon trying, which lowers the sense of earned payoff or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear tour structure ("walk, then dip, then jump") lacking causal friction or reversal. The protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacles, and the resolution relies on a pre-existing state of readiness rather than an earned on-page change.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without causal tension; the inciting incident ("leash broke") is abstract and disconnected from the specific actions taken. Closure is achieved through a ritual act (punching stars) that feels tonally complete but lacks earned causality or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: the child's arrival forces the bellhop to confront his past decision, leading directly to the retrieval of the bolt and the climax. The "stain as oracle" element relies slightly on coincidence (signaling hope just before the child arrives), but it effectively sets the mood without breaking causality. Closure is decisive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Days bled into weeks") to bridge the inciting incident and climax, violating the scope of a short story by replacing dramatized scene work with high-level telling. This structure dissipates tension, as the protagonist sets a trap and simply waits for it to spring, lacking immediate causal pressure or on-page obstacles. The climax is observed from a distance, resulting in a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence: the waterlogged journal washing up against the generator housing with the exact coordinates needed to solve the mystery. This creates a causality break where luck replaces agency at the pivotal turn. Additionally, the ending dissolves into a summary montage ("Fishermen returned... Children learned"), reducing the narrative tension into a fable-like conclusion rather than a concrete scene closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    Closure is present (the rebellion restarts), but it relies on a "deus ex machina" event (the stones humming) to solve the protagonist's problem without cost. The gathering of the others feels like a coincidental, symmetric satisfaction rather than a consequence of the protagonist's specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, friction-free path where the ritual succeeds without complication or unexpected cost. While the Conceptual Repricing closure (releasing destiny to the many) is legible, the lack of causal obstacles makes the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative structure relies on iterative summary ("I return every dawn," "One afternoon," "One morning") rather than a pressurized, singular scene, diffusing tension. The timeline drifts, presenting a montage of healing rather than a dramatized turning point, which prevents the closure from feeling causally earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative operates effectively under a Situational/Surreal lens, where the collapsing reality forces a reconfiguration of the self. The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the box repairs and the artist transforms. However, the causality is largely dream-driven ("the walls responded by exhaling shelves"), which works for the genre but relies on asserted connections rather than inevitable narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is undeniable as the protagonist undergoes a Decisive Change (disappearance). However, the narrative relies on a sudden shift to dream logic—leaping from observing ink patterns to physical dissolution—which lacks sufficient on-page mechanical setup to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear Decisive Change and distinct closure. However, the reliance on the "Resonance Table"—a device that conveniently translates physical letters into telepathic emotion—bypasses the logistical friction of the premise, making the resolution feel unearned and magical rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure effectively paints a portrait of the protagonist's life, but the narrative lacks a decisive turning point or escalation. The vignettes with visitors function as repetitive illustrations of her wisdom rather than beats that raise the cost of her choices. Closure is legible as an affirmation of her vow, but the stakes remain static.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, with a clear inciting entry, a ritualistic climax, and a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The inversion logic ("sky became floor") functions well within the surreal physics, though the trigger feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a linear execution of a plan with no setbacks; the "spy satellite optics" explanation is a convenient techno-magic shortcut that lowers credibility. Closure is achieved through a decisive action (sending the email), but the lack of complications makes the plot feel like a procedural summary rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from discovery to resolution, but relies on convenient proximity—finding the amber and letters exactly when needed to solve the machine's glitch. The causality follows "dream logic," where symbolic actions (singing, bleeding) yield immediate mechanical results without established ground rules.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure with a distinct closure unit (Conceptual Repricing). However, the resolution—adjusting a sand line to harmonize voices—feels mechanical and lacks a felt cost, as she immediately smiles at the breaking of the tile.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the scene has a legible arc, causality breaks at the climax; the magistrate’s reversal relies on "narrative logic" (it happens because the theme requires it) rather than human reaction. The drive lens (Accumulative) builds a pattern of renaming, but the resolution feels unearned because the opposition offers no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (transformation into the tree) is a legible Decisive Change. However, the progression is linear and low-resistance; the magical intervention works exactly as intended without complication, making the plot feel more like a procedural vignette than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, gathering sensory proofs to build toward the final vision. While the closure—opening the studio—is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, the progression feels somewhat linear and low-resistance; the magic system solves the problem without a significant tactical setback or twist.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is coherent and linear, moving from ritual to activation to release, but lacks causal tension. The closure—a successful transmission of data—feels inevitable rather than earned against odds. The "Resonant Reconfiguration" (solitary to connected) lands, but the lack of prior obstacles softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure violates the scope default, relying on a lifetime montage ("Each morning," "decades of ritual," "began leaving") rather than a continuous scene with immediate causal pressure. While the "One evening" segment offers a brief scenic anchor, the narrative quickly reverts to summary, diffusing tension and preventing a tight causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the central mechanic of the climax defies physical logic. Relying on "spring’s thaw" to transport a loose microfilm coil "through soil and root" into a secure underground cache strains credibility and confuses the spatial choreography of the hatch. The causality of the hiding method is more poetic than functional, weakening the reality of the tradecraft.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a linear ritual structure that leads to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration via the needle transfer. However, the climatic clearing of the fog coinciding exactly with the emotional release is a convenient pathetic fallacy that resolves the external tension too neatly without earning it through the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing an Accumulative lens to build toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure (leaving the glass). The causality is solid, though the pivotal realization relies slightly on summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear "symmetric satisfaction" arc: the goal is established, executed without obstruction, and validated by the ending, lacking the required cost or deepening. The closure relies on a stated emotional shift ("protected vulnerability") rather than a causal consequence of the scene’s events. The orientation and pacing are competent, but the structure lacks a turning point that alters the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a linear sequence that culminates in a convenient, magical resolution; Veyra’s skin "flaring gold" to stabilize the mechanism is a deus ex machina that bypasses established constraints. The climax lacks a causal setup—her ability to "force harmony" appears only when needed. Closure is achieved through this sudden ability rather than a tactical trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear dream-logic progression with no causal setbacks, resulting in a low-tension arc. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of hesitation or sacrifice robs the transformation of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and clear, but the climax relies on a pre-built "jury-rigged box" rather than in-scene improvisation. This convenient solution dissolves the tension too easily, lacking the "felt cost" required for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving efficiently from the nexus to the squeeze to the chamber. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (reframing the mutiny as liberation), though the transition from physical danger to philosophical acceptance is slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a fragile coincidence: Elira lights candles in a vast quarry, and the suspect immediately emerges to confess. The central mystery’s resolution creates a logical void; if the man didn't kill the women and there are "no bodies," their disappearance remains unexplained, clashing with the "cold case" procedural frame. Closure lands emotionally but falters causally.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    The resolution relies on a convenience-based "magic key" structure where finding the object instantly solves the problem without complication or cost. The lack of resistance during the procedure flattens the narrative arc into a linear progression of success.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where external reality (scaffold flutters, glass behavior) bends instantly to the protagonist's internal state, reducing narrative tension. Closure arrives via a magical epiphany rather than earned causality or paid cost; the loss of the glass flake feels symbolic rather than a consequence of a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story violates the scope default by summarizing a five-year timeline ("Five years ago," "For three years") instead of grounding the narrative in a single, developed scene. Consequently, the closure is a status update on a lifestyle change that occurred off-page, lacking a distinct event with immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear Inciting Incident and Climax, but the resolution comes too easily; the "singing" solution dissolves the obstacle instantly without a tested failure or complication. The transition to the lucid dream is smooth, but the lack of causal friction makes the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the curse is lifted and the protagonist transformed. The causality holds well within the dream logic of the piece, moving cleanly from the planting of the seed to the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: arrive, walk, place object, succeed. There is no deviation, obstacle, or moment of doubt that tests the protagonist's resolve. The ending ("All she had to do was heed") frames the resolution as inevitable submission rather than a decisive change born of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a deus ex machina (roots trapping the antagonist) rather than protagonist agency. The resolution—immediate collaboration—feels unearned and lacks a visible cost or trade-off for Elira.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the closure relies on a tidy, mechanical solution (typing "Project Echo") that feels like a soft reset rather than an earned evolution. The "erosion" of his resistance is stated rather than dramatized, reducing the causal weight of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is functional but strictly linear: arrival, diagnosis, action, success, departure. The resolution lacks a decisive turning point where the outcome is in doubt; the protagonist’s method works instantly on the first try without complication or adaptation, resulting in a low-friction plot.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a "day in the life" vignette describing a routine process without a disruption or decisive change. Closure is a return to stasis ("ready to smelt the next tide") which lacks the required felt or conceptual cost to qualify as a Resonant Reconfiguration under the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is a linear ritual with no causal resistance; the "fragmented texts" act as a convenient instruction manual that eliminates the struggle of discovery. Closure is a transformative ascension, but because success was never in doubt and no distinct price was paid, the reconfiguration feels weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative lens, effectively building pressure through a series of observations and musical interactions. Closure lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) with the "Track 3" realization, shifting the protagonist's stance from external waiting to internal navigation. The pacing is steady, though the episodic nature of finding graffiti limits causal momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative loop is structurally sound and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the seeker becomes the archive—lands with logical satisfaction. The "cyclically reversed" nature is well-integrated into the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative flows smoothly as a single scene, but the climax lacks a true "pinch" point or causal complexity. The resolution relies on a "deus ex natura" where the magic solves the problem instantly upon the antagonist's arrival, bypassing a dramatized test of the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure that lacks causal complications or obstacles, reading more like a vignette than a story with narrative drive. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and thematic, the lack of resistance or meaningful tightening prior to the end makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative drive is static; the pivotal emotional shift (forgiveness) occurs in backstory, leaving the present scene as a low-stakes ceremony of enactment. While closure is technically achieved through the symbolic placement of the hairpin, the "release" feels asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a visible cost or high-stakes choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scene is coherent and structurally sound, with a clear inciting moment and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The reliance on the specific "wind chime code" as a plot device to dictate the protagonist's action feels convenient, functioning as a minor Deus Ex Machina that solves the hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear lesson structure but relies on environmental coincidence (the sudden gust of wind) to trigger the student’s epiphany rather than earned insight. The closure creates a Charged Poise for a future event ("Tomorrow..."), but the scene itself lacks a decisive causal turn driven by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece functions as a static vignette or prose poem rather than a narrative with a causal arc; the drive lens is purely accumulative. While the orientation is clear, the closure is an "Earned Stasis" that feels low-cost because the status quo (waiting) is never genuinely threatened or tested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fable-like structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a resonant closure (leaving small charms) that feels earned. The causal link in the middle relies on the mystical logic of the mist rather than protagonist decision-making, but the resolution lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "destiny" trope (pre-signed vow) undermines causality; the protagonist succeeds because it was written, not because of choices made under pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but without a felt cost—he gains the revelation and surfaces easily, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina event—the static coming "unbidden"—to resolve the central conflict. This breaks the causal chain, as the protagonist receives the answer rather than forging it through pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, successfully using the ritual to drive closure via a Resonant Reconfiguration of the reaper's role. The pacing is consistent, though the inciting incident (finding the recordings) is summarized backstory rather than an active pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is clear, functioning as a polished procedural vignette where the ritual leads directly to the result. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the ecosystem, but the trajectory lacks complication or deeper causality; the plan works exactly as intended without unforeseen obstacles. The "cost" is primarily patience, which lowers the dramatic weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the orientation is excellent. However, the resolution relies on an unearned reversal by the antagonist (the State), who capitulates without inflicting a "felt cost" on the protagonist. The "permanent assignment" reads more as a reward than a consequence, softening the closure into a fable-like symmetry that lacks grit.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of ritual success with no significant obstacles or setbacks; the inciting desire leads directly to the desired outcome without complication. The resolution relies on a "have your cake and eat it too" dynamic where she gains wonder without losing logic, lacking the requisite "felt or conceptual cost" for a high-band closure. The ending feels chemically inevitable rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative functions as a linear vignette of a routine success rather than a story with a decisive turn or structural deepening. Closure is achieved through the resumption of the status quo (Earned Stasis) without a visible on-page cost or a reconfigured understanding of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to closure, successfully shifting the status quo of the brain. However, the central conflict—the custody battle—dissolves largely because the protagonist ignores it, rather than through a causal tactical victory. The resolution feels slightly convenient, with the "metaphysical trial" acting as atmospheric noise rather than a structural obstacle that forces a costly deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story violates the single-scene scope default, relying on a summary "chronicle" mode that spans decades. While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (the journal entry), the cost is abstract because it is not earned through immediate, high-pressure action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story functions as a vignette or prose poem (Accumulative lens) rather than a causal narrative. While the ritual is clear, the "hourglass" framing feels disconnected from the scene's immediate logic. The ending ("begins again") offers Earned Stasis, but the lack of a decisive turn or rising action makes the structure feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story achieves a solid Resonant Reconfiguration closure; the waking of the statue fundamentally alters the guardian's status quo. While the causality leans on soft magic (loneliness activating the pendant), the thematic logic holds up well. The narrative orientation is clear, and the ending feels earned within the established dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc through the ritual to a successful closure via Conceptual Repricing (deconstruction vs. destruction). The pacing is steady, though the climactic realization is somewhat abstractly delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality and structure are strong, using the ritualistic setup to create a clear arc from preparation to activation. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with the city waking and the fragment dissolving, though the pivot point ("discarding assumptions") feels slightly convenient and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the protagonist succeeds by instinct and environmental assistance (eels tracing equations) rather than earned causality. The ending executes a "soft reset" where consequences are erased (passengers have no memory of loss), depriving the story of felt cost or lasting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure works within the dream logic, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration ("walls settled"). However, the climax ("ceiling split") arrives "without warning," feeling slightly disconnected from the specific intensity of the protagonist's actions, and the resolution comes relatively easily.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative establishes a compelling situation but resolves via summary ("By semester’s end") rather than a dramatized climax with visible cost; the power outage serves as a reflective pause rather than a causal turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with solid orientation and legible closure. However, the resolution feels structurally symmetric and low-friction; the problem is introduced and solved with a perfect tool and speech, lacking a "micro turn" or complication that forces the protagonist to adapt. The cost of "kneeling in the damp" is asserted rather than dramatized as a significant price.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure ("insert key, activate machine") where success is never seriously in doubt. While the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure lands, it relies on the mechanics of the device rather than a protagonist-driven causal turn that alters the outcome. The pacing is steady, but the lack of a significant reversal or complication flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative drive lens, moving from preparation to ritual to realization with a legible conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands cleanly with the decision to leave, but the narrative arc lacks causal resistance; the ritual succeeds without complication, making the progression feel linear and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (wait, method, success) without a significant snag, reversal, or unexpected cost to generate tension. While the closure is thematically resonant, the lack of an on-page obstacle makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and cohesive, fulfilling the Drive Lens (Causal/Ritualistic) with clear closure. However, the sequence lacks a moment of doubt or complication; the ritual proceeds exactly as planned without forcing a deviation or meaningful adaptation from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a smooth, resistance-free trajectory where the protagonist acts and the world immediately complies. While closure is achieved through a decisive transformation of the setting, the lack of setbacks or genuine opposition makes the causality feel dreamlike rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path: arrival, complication (tightened border), and successful execution. However, the resolution—using the storm to mask the drone—feels pre-calculated and lacks a moment of genuine doubt or improvisation that would spike the tension. The ending provides closure but relies on a convenient "nature is the best smuggler" explanation that lowers the narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of convenience where the "wrong turn" offers no resistance and the solution (magic) is immediate. Closure arrives as a foregone conclusion without causal friction or a Decisive Change that forces a trade-off; the result is a tableau, not a story arc.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    Causality is clean and the magic system is internally consistent, moving logically from search to activation. The score is capped because the ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—she succeeds completely with no visible or felt cost, leaving the "utterly satisfied" resolution feeling structurally too neat for high-band literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the dream is reclaimed. However, the resolution feels procedural—a recipe followed without immediate on-page resistance or complication in the final beat, making the victory feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.0)
    Causality moves via dream logic ("walls became sky") rather than concrete mechanism; the central obstacle is bypassed instantly without failure or tactical adjustment. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" (tying a ribbon) rather than a decisive change with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is distinct (Earned Stasis), but the central investigation relies on a convenient shortcut: the breakthrough comes from "instinct" rather than the data, and the trawler veers at the precise moment required by the plot. The causal chain is slightly weakened by this reliance on coincidence to trigger the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift from "siege" to "delta" in the tea leaves reprices the cartographer's despair and stabilizes the archivist's exile. The magic system’s logic is consistent and shapes the narrative arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success without causal friction or setbacks. The ending is an example of "symmetric satisfaction"—the problem is solved because the protagonist wills it, with no visible or felt cost to earn the resolution. The "thinning worlds" provide background stakes but do not exert active pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear ritual structure with legible causality and a clear climax (the guilt knot). However, the closure relies on symmetric satisfaction—the task is simply completed—rather than a reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance or a payment of significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing (silence as vessel) at closure under an Accumulative lens. However, the progression is frictionless; the protagonist sets up equipment and succeeds immediately without complication. The lack of "felt cost" or meaningful obstacles makes the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic causality that fits the tone, but the sudden exposition about the "Captain" acts as a convenient patch to explain the artifact's origin. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, though the link between Earhart and the narrator's sister remains associative rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is strictly linear with no causal turns, obstacles, or meaningful tightening; the protagonist’s attempt succeeds immediately without complication. Closure acts as a Conceptual Repricing (shifting from isolation to community) but lacks a visible on-page cost or earned causality to give it weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.6)
    The structure is linear and relies on environmental coincidence (light hitting the goggles) to advance the plot rather than character agency. The ascent provides a frame, but the resolution—reading a diary that delivers the theme explicitly—lacks a causal turn or a felt cost paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, building density around the central metaphor until the climax reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the void. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cloud’s dissolution proves emptiness is a vessel, not a vacuum. The cost is the isolation required to sustain this fragile worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, adhering to a Situational drive lens that crystallizes the protagonist's stance under pressure. Closure is excellent: a Conceptual Repricing where the destruction of the art confirms its value as "atmosphere" rather than object, landing with undeniable cost and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear arc of discovery, but the causality relies heavily on the convenient logic of the hopscotch board controlling the ship via unexplained enchantments. The pivot from discovery to mastery is abrupt, summarized in a montage ("By noon..."), and the Captain’s instant acceptance bypasses necessary narrative friction. Closure is a Decisive Change, but it lacks the requisite cost or trade-off to earn a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear ritual progression leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the locksmith abandons her tools for a new understanding. Causality holds well, though the "voice" in the climax functions as a convenient prompt rather than organic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear procession ("procession of trust") rather than a causal chain of choices with consequences. The resolution relies on a "magic bell" mechanics that feels convenient, offering a distinct upgrade (survival) without a visible, felt cost or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression with no deviation or complication. While the closure (the end of time) is definitive, the lack of causal friction or obstacles makes the sequence feel inevitable and low-stakes. The logic is consistent within its mythic frame, but the structure is static.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a powerful Earned Stasis; the choice to pass the key while remaining behind creates a felt cost that reweights the narrative. The Situational drive holds firmly, with the inciting incident and climax linked by clear, character-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands clearly with a Conceptual Repricing (redesigning the mesh for dissolution), but the pivotal insight is partly situated in a flashback ("kneeling here last monsoon... And in that moment... she understood"). This temporal ambiguity dilutes the pressure of the present scene, as the realization feels partially pre-processed.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear Accumulative structure, effectively using the transactions to demonstrate the "distribution of weight." Orientation is handled quickly, and the closure—a sense of lightness gained through the ritual—lands clearly. However, the progression is predictable, lacking a sharp causal turn or complication that would test the vendor's resolve or method.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from entry to resolution with clear closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the logic driving the search ("analyzing tidal pool formations in mirages") reads as "technobabble" convenience rather than grounded causality. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—the problem is solved completely—lacking a complicating cost or lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" trajectory where competence solves the problem without setback or meaningful cost; the "magic happens" resolution feels unearned. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a Decisive Change with a felt price, resulting in a low-tension procedural structure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear process description without causal friction; the protagonist succeeds at her task without complication. Closure creates a thematic restatement rather than a decisive change with visible cost, leaving the arc feeling like a static vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path (Lens: Causal), but the discovery of Fragment Delta feels overly convenient for the gravity mechanic. Closure is achieved through simple task completion ("Earned Stasis") without a distinct conceptual or emotional reweighting of the initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution track without a decisive turning point or felt cost; the resolution is achieved through a single successful sequence of actions. The ending offers a "success state" where the world is healed, but the lack of sacrifice makes the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is static; the protagonist sits, thinks, and stands up without facing external resistance or making a choice with legible cost. The resolution is a "soft reset" where internal anxiety dissolves via meditation, lacking the necessary causal friction for a story of this length. The ending relies on a declared state change rather than an earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, following a clear progression of attempts and adjustments to a successful resolution. Closure is achieved through "Earned Stasis" as she withstands the fireworks. While the causality follows "magic system" logic, the urgency of opening the clasp *before* the fireworks feels thematically driven rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on a "magical fix" where the flower's scent instantly cures the village's social discord, bypassing causal logic and eliminating cost. The ending lacks a decisive change driven by the protagonist, settling instead for a fable-like summary of improvement that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight, utilizing the "gravity inversion" effectively as a ticking clock that pressures the climax. The closure (planting the arrow) creates a distinct, legible change in the world state and the protagonist's outlook, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate and effective, anchoring the reader in the silent port. The narrative arc creates a coherent situational drive that lands a valid Charged Poise closure ("Let it learn me too"), where the protagonist accepts the adversarial relationship with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear success-only trajectory where the ritual is performed without obstruction, resulting in a predictable outcome. Causality is weak; the climax (thawing the laughter) feels like an unearned reward rather than a consequence of a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is linear and coherent, but the middle section lacks resistance; the ritual and exploration proceed with perfect efficiency, devoid of complications that would test the plan. The shift to a summary explanation at the end ("Years later") diffuses the immediate tension of the scene and explains the closure rather than letting the final image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("She never signed," "She didn't know") rather than a concrete, causal scene, resulting in a static profile rather than a story. The timeline is confusing, anchoring "Tonight" to the widow’s grief and later to a mathematician’s madness, creating a disorienting loop. The excursion to the warlord’s perspective breaks the scene anchor and dissipates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative sets up a time-sensitive delivery ("due before dawn") but undermines it by having the courier leisurely visit a market without consequence. While the closure (releasing the pendant) acts as a Decisive Change, the primary external plot thread dissolves rather than resolving through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds toward a clear closure where the protagonist's stance is reconfigured by the revelation. The ending lands a valid Conceptual Repricing (choosing resonance over replication), though the "melting on release" beat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure is strong, with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist pays the ultimate price to deliver the message. However, causality suffers significantly from the "rummage sale box," which functions as a tonal breach and a convenient Deus Ex Machina to provide the solution without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (returning the magic to the source) is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the causality of the final magic act relies on "soft magic" logic—pressing the silk to the glyph solves the depletion problem somewhat conveniently without a hard-won mechanical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is legible and the transition mechanics are handled smoothly, creating a clear causal arc. However, the climax relies on a convenient information dump ("memories not hers flooded in") to resolve the central mystery, effectively stopping the scene to explain the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    A major continuity error disrupts causality: Elias places the sea glass on the sill, yet moments later it is pulsing in his pocket without a retrieval beat. Additionally, the lamp's restoration relies on ghostly coincidence rather than protagonist agency, weakening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative structure ("otherworldly routine") that lacks a distinct causal turn; the "unusual urgency" introduced acts as atmosphere rather than a complication forcing a new tactic. The ending provides closure to the shift but feels like a default reset rather than a consequence of a specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on summary montage ("After seven sunrises," "By the twelfth") instead of a contiguous scene with rising pressure, distancing the reader from critical turns. The closure—a responsive fabric—is conceptually distinct but feels like a foregone conclusion of a synopsis rather than the result of immediate, dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well for this atmospheric piece, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's role shifts. Causality is generally sound, though the "self-repairing in moonlight" beat resolves the central mechanical obstacle with convenient magic rather than agent-driven effort.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks causal complication; the resolution arrives instantly upon the protagonist's first action (humming), solving a generational collapse without the required "decisive change" involving sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear realization arc, but the causality is internal and low-friction; the environment ("books slid gently") cooperates instantly rather than providing resistance. Closure is a legible Decisive Change (revealing herself), but it arrives via reflection rather than pressured action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural drive, where ritual actions build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the return of the water). The closure lands with a legible shift in mood and stance. However, the connection between the offering and the spring's return relies on a fable-like logic that feels slightly convenient, lacking a sharper causal or felt cost beyond the symbolic shedding of the shawl.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear accumulative structure (measure vow 1, 2, 3) that fulfills the procedural premise but lacks a sharp causal turn. The closure is a valid "Conceptual Repricing" where the act of recording becomes an existential defense, yet the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-cost struggle or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the inciting incident and climax are clear. However, the resolution relies on a convenience—the hardened smuggler fleeing instantly at a symbol—which undercuts the tension and makes the victory feel unearned and devoid of complication.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is distinct, utilizing a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist surrenders her need for answers. The structure is linear but effective, guiding the reader clearly from the inciting arrival to the transformative convergence. The orientation is established quickly, and the ending resonates with the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.7)
    Causality breaks when the lock opens via "resonance" rather than protagonist agency, resolving the central obstacle with magical convenience. The narrative is a linear ritual without resistance or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the map's discovery to the journey and final realization. The "flashback" to finding the map ("Yesterday...") slightly drags the opening momentum, but the transition to the active quest is handled efficiently. Closure is distinct and resonant, reconfiguring the protagonist's role within the world with an implied ongoing cost of bearing witness.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.5)
    The piece fails the fundamental requirement of a dramatic scene, offering instead a generalized summary of a lifespan without a distinct inciting incident or rising action. The narrative drifts through years and seasons, resulting in a biography-style synopsis that lacks immediate causal pressure or a defined closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure is achieved through a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, where the caretaker's internal change resolves the external crisis. The causality follows a dream-logic (syncing internal rhythm to fix a pump) which fits the tone but leans heavily on metaphorical resonance over mechanical cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on convenient magical psychometry ("emotional resonance") rather than causal investigation or earned revelation. The resolution is rushed and summarized ("Each story loosened something"), creating a "symmetric satisfaction" ending that feels unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative operates on dream-logic where dance moves assertively control technology; while consistent within its lyrical lens, the causal chain lacks mechanical grounding. The closure lands as a resonant transformation ("rewritten"), but the lack of concrete resistance makes the sequence feel like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the resolution relies on "adventure game logic" where the correct item (aster) unlocks the obstacle (door) without complication. While the closure (stepping through) is a Decisive Change, the mechanism is convenient and lacks a "felt cost" beyond the voluntary departure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks causal tension; the central conflict dissolves immediately upon the prophecy's whisper without testing the protagonist's resolve. The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the problem transforms into a calling, lacking a felt price or genuine complication.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with exceptional clarity and resonance; the exchange of the seal for the key creates a definitive "before" and "after" for the relationship and the quest. The pacing is elegant, utilizing the flashback to the "sugar" routine to charge the present moment with historical weight without stalling momentum. The drive lens (Hybrid Situational/Accumulative) holds perfectly through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of success without obstruction, reversal, or the threat of failure; she intends to archive and simply does so. Closure is achieved through a declared completed task rather than a causal turn, and the "cost" is abstractly referenced in backstory rather than paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear goal and decisive closure that resolves the central conflict. The causality is linear and logical, though the resolution—where the drought breaks immediately upon the final stroke—feels slightly convenient and lacks a lingering sense of consequence or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative momentum stalls significantly in the middle, relying on an expository summary ("The first layer... The second...") to convey key plot points rather than dramatizing the discovery. The climax resolves linearly without a complication or reversal, making the victory feel inevitable and unearned by narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (the released spirit), but the linear progression lacks significant friction or a decisive tightening moment before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the ending confirms the opening state without a shift in stakes or knowledge. Causality is replaced by a sequence of ritual actions that do not escalate pressure, and the "cost" required for closure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Structure is linear and competent, but the narrative lacks causal friction; the protagonist arrives with the solution, applies it, and succeeds instantly. The critical information (Project Stillpoint) is delivered via a backstory dump about "shredded letters" rather than discovered through scene action. Closure is achieved, but without a felt cost or decisive change in the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and lacks resistance; the storm is described as a "veil" but acts as mere set-dressing rather than an obstacle that forces a tactical change. Closure is a "success" state achieved without visible cost or sacrifice, making the victory feel unearned. The arrival of the "new voice" acts as a convenient prompt that resolves the wait without generating causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on exposition and summary (the townsfolk's visits, the passage of time) rather than immediate scene work. While the accumulative structure leads to a coherent thematic closure, the lack of a decisive, costly turn on the page reduces narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the resolution relies on a "magic bullet" ending where the conflict evaporates instantly upon singing, lacking a visceral cost. The "sonic absolution" conversion of the antagonists feels too convenient, reducing the structural tension to a simple "apply key, win" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary and generalized time ("Each night," "By midwinter") rather than dramatizing a specific scene with immediate stakes. There is no decisive change or cost paid on the page; the story describes a state of affairs rather than a causal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.6)
    A severe continuity error fractures the closure. The protagonist places the lantern on the rail to act as an "anchor," explicitly leaving it behind ("Where it sits, the air grows still"), yet in the next paragraph, it is in her coat pocket at street level. This physical impossibility undermines the logic of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident and rising action centered on the mechanical problem. While the resolution relies on a coincidental environmental trigger (the beam of light), it functions as a thematic catalyst that shifts the protagonist's perspective (knowledge state) rather than performing the work for him, preserving agency in the final repair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bell stirs—lands with appropriate weight. However, the plot is linear and procedural; the obstacles are anticipated and overcome without a significant twist or deepening of the dilemma that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative structure effectively utilizes a mosaic/montage approach to compress a complex investigation into a short form while maintaining causality. The climax in the vault is a distinct, high-pressure moment that anchors the surrounding summary. Closure is strong, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's reality, though the heavy reliance on summary for the investigation phase slightly distances the reader from the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a vignette with no causal drive or structural pressure; events proceed linearly without obstruction or consequence. The closure is purely symbolic and assertive—a rhetorical question posed to the air—lacking a decisive change or earned resonance anchored in a concrete outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from a specific quest to a dramatic climax and thematic realization. However, the resolution relies on a "days later" summary that glosses over the physical struggle of survival; showing the cost of that endurance on the page would have strengthened the earned nature of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is legible and orientation is strong, with the bus station and vineyard clearly anchored. However, the narrative drive relies on a linear lesson-teaching sequence rather than causal pressure or genuine risk. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (reframing failure), but it feels soft because the cost—years of misunderstanding—is backstory, not paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with no causal turns or obstacles; the ritual succeeds because she initiates it, not because she overcomes resistance. The ending offers satisfaction but lacks a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" with a legible cost beyond generic fatigue ("spent focus").

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc, accumulation of pressure, or a decisive change; the ending is a routine exit rather than a resolution with cost. No drive lens operates here; the story lists actions without altering the status quo or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a quasi-scientific tone (frequencies, calibration) but resolves with a genre-breaking miracle (the crystal speaking English), which functions as a *deus ex machina*. This externalizes the climax, robbing the protagonist of an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure works well, building from the driftwood arrangement to the chalk test and finally the tapes. The closure—an Earned Stasis where he resets but the markers remain—lands with appropriate conceptual cost, validating the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual enactment: the world breaks, she performs a symbolic repair, and it works perfectly. While the closure lands a resonant image (braided time), the lack of causal friction or necessary adaptation during the attempt makes the plot feel like a vignette without structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear procession of successes with no causal turns or obstacles. The transition from the inciting incident ("blood work") to the haven is abrupt, and the subsequent events lack logical friction or cost. The ending feels predetermined rather than earned through narrative labor.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("spent her nights," "each night") rather than a dramatized scene, reducing the story to a synopsis of events. While the conceptual closure (restoring balance by becoming the loop) is legible, the lack of immediate, unfolding action distances the reader from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is a static vignette centered on a ritual, lacking a decisive turning point or escalation within the scene. The shift to future tense ("Later, townsfolk would find...") deflates immediate tension by summarizing the resolution instead of dramatizing it. While the final image of the pulsing tooth offers a form of resonant closure, the lack of an on-page cost or obstacle limits its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is complete and the closure (the child's reaction validating the method) lands with legible resonance. However, the structure relies on visible mechanical scaffolding, specifically the phrase "memories resurfaced" used three times to trigger flashbacks, which disrupts the causal flow.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a linear vignette of a ritual without a causal turn or obstacle; closure is atmospheric rather than structural, lacking a "tightening" or decisive change in options.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story functions well under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through images before releasing it in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the shell on the earth, the nexus vanishing). The transition from the surreal nexus to the realistic pier provides excellent structural grounding for the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a successful ritual rather than a dramatic story; the ending provides closure but lacks a "Decisive Change" driven by sacrifice or a legible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative functions as a linear procedural of a ritual rather than a dramatic arc; events unfold exactly as planned without interruption, reversal, or unexpected cost. The "flash-paper" is introduced as a loaded gun but deliberately holstered, which, while thematically consistent, deflates potential tension and leaves the closure feeling like a routine completion of a task.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path of success without a distinct turning point that alters the stakes. The closure—sealing the archive and leaving—is legible as an "Earned Stasis," but the lack of prior jeopardy makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The "years later" coda dilutes the immediate impact of his departure by shifting into a generalized legend summary.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is solid, moving efficiently from a demonstration of the magic system to a personal application that raises the stakes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, with the protagonist reaffirming her burden; the "cost proof" is met by her refusal to seek freedom over endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is solid, using the kettle as a functional scene clock that creates immediate pressure. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, as the finished carving recontextualizes her grief. The narrative arc is clean and legible, though the internal epiphany feels slightly rushed relative to the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The rising action works well, but the closure relies on an "envelope ex machina" where the solution is handed to the protagonist rather than earned through the struggle. The discovery of a written thesis statement in a drawer short-circuits the causal chain, resolving the plot via authorial intrusion rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative structure is linear and episodic (arrive, fix, observe, conclude) with no causal friction or setbacks. Closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but it lacks a felt or visible cost; the protagonist succeeds at every turn, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, following an accumulative structure that leads to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's mindset. The pacing is steady, and the orientation within the sanctuary is clear. The causality is somewhat soft, relying on the magical properties of the crystal to resolve the internal conflict rather than a hard-won realization.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality relies on "magical physics" where a sundial's shadow aligns with an underwater reflection in a way that defies optics. Temporal orientation is contradictory: the scene is set at "twilight" with "first stars" (evening), yet the trigger is "silence of morning radio" (pre-dawn), creating an unresolved timeline clash.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The scene is structurally sound with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the mission is redefined. However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the "test" to gain access is passed instantly, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story functions as a static vignette or portrait rather than a narrative with causal progression; it is a single beat of reflection. While the Accumulative lens is consistent, the lack of an inciting incident or meaningful tightening leaves the dramatic arc flat. Closure is a gentle resonant reconfiguration (the crane) but lacks a felt cost or decisive change in the traveler’s state.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, but the resolution relies on a magical success without a distinct on-page cost or trade-off. The transition from mechanical tinkering to global restoration is poetic but lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear ritualistic structure where intent leads immediately to success without complication or unexpected cost. While the scene is coherent, the lack of a causal turn or obstacle makes the closure feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, lacking a "felt cost" at the closure; the protagonist ends with "residue of gratitude" rather than a price paid. A significant orientation/logic break occurs with the "migrating geese paused mid-flight" alongside an old man walking a dog; the text never clarifies if time is stopped or if the geese are a broken metaphor, disrupting the world's physical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, moving linearly from diagnosis to resolution without stumbling. However, the closure feels inevitable rather than earned through a decisive turn; the "fix" works immediately upon application, lacking a moment of tactical failure or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative lens, building texture effectively, but the causality is weak; events happen sequentially without forcing the protagonist to make difficult trade-offs. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of a visible or felt cost on the page limits its impact to a gentle vignette rather than a narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a contrived flashback mechanism (the light-activated micro-script on a rake) to resolve the central conflict, which disrupts the causal chain with a "National Treasure"-style puzzle device in a literary piece. The closure—the pendulum restarting itself via "organic grace"—breaks the established physical reality without sufficient setup, functioning as a deus ex machina rather than a reasoned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, effectively using the tapestry ritual to drive toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. While the inciting entry is soft, the ending lands a distinct conceptual repricing of the protagonist's role, making the before/after state legible and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative reads as a vignette or prologue rather than a causal story; the protagonist faces no resistance, obstacles, or complications. The ending is a predetermined completion of a ritual rather than a resolution earned through struggle or adaptation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure lands with a clear shift in agency, but the climax relies on a "Radio ex Machina." The protagonist does not deduce the solution (tears); the lyrics explicitly provide the instruction manual at the last second, undermining the causal chain and her agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a static vignette rather than a narrative with causal propulsion; while the atmosphere accumulates, the actual turn (the woman's visit) resolves without complication or cost. Closure is present (Resonant Reconfiguration), but it feels unearned because the preceding action faced no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    The structure violates the short-story scope by presenting a summary montage ("Each morning," "When envoys descended") rather than a singular, causal scene. The specific moment at the bell tower is illustrative but lacks a decisive turn or cost, resulting in a static portrait rather than a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is static, relying on a large block of backstory reflection (approx. 40% of the text) to establish stakes before the scene activates. While the closure lands a resonant image of beginning, the arrival of the student feels coincidental and convenient rather than causally earned by the protagonist's actions in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure that maintains coherence and clarity, but the progression feels frictionless. The growing of the seed and the immediate resolution—where obstacles "surrender" rather than resist—undercut the sense of causality and cost, making the closure feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative structure is clean, moving from stasis to inciting riddle to revelation with clear pacing. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—recontextualizing the bees from broken drones to living capacitors. The causal link regarding why Elias needs to hide (implying danger) is loose, but the thematic closure regarding the tower’s true purpose lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks causal friction; the protagonist intends to act and simply does so without opposition. Closure relies on an internal feeling ("warmth bloomed") that feels unearned because no significant obstacle was overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is coherent, but the central revelation relies entirely on exposition via telepathy and parchment text rather than dramatized discovery. The mechanics of the ampoule—opened to retrieve parchment, then smashed to release light despite being "empty"—strain physical causality for the sake of metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from endurance to active rupture to reconfiguration. The closure (die vanishing, internal texture captured) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that pays off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative structure is accumulative and summary-heavy, relying on a montage of magical successes ("barista paused," "note appeared") rather than causal scene work. The ending, while thematically coherent, lacks a requisite on-page cost or decisive change; the arrival of the girl is a reward for routine action rather than a resolution earned through difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on summary and montage to cover a long period ("long forgotten," "One evening," "When travelers... returned"), violating the default preference for a continuous scene. The narrative mode creates distance, and the climax—a montage of people joining in—lacks a distinct, pressurized causal trigger on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The plot follows a linear "quest for the object" structure, but the climax relies on a bootstrap paradox (receiving the gear from his future self) that resolves the conflict through convenience rather than present-tense struggle. The scale of the resolution—rewriting global history—feels unearned by the short, localized setup.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure relies on linear dream logic where the advisor's instructions work immediately and perfectly without complication. The climax lacks tactical friction; the antagonist dissolves instantly upon the first attempt, making the resolution feel unearned despite the clear closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative logic is consistent within its magical realism frame, and the closure lands with a clear resonant reconfiguration. The causality of the sound-magic system is maintained, though the solution (striking the apple) feels slightly convenient in its swift resolution of the obsidian threat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change (leaving the city), but the narrative structure relies heavily on summary and retrospective backstory ("Yesterday, she’d cracked a new sequence"). The pivotal inciting incident—the watcher turning—is recalled rather than dramatized in the present scene, which flattens the immediate tension of the packing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story functions as a vignette or prologue rather than a complete narrative arc; the inciting incident (finding the letter) leads immediately to a resolved state of mind without escalating complications. The closure relies on a "future plan" summary ("She'd time her revelations") rather than a decisive on-page change with paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, using the rising drawbridge effectively to seal the scene and force interiority. The climax (finding the letter) and closure (ritual copying) provide a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance. The pacing is steady, though the inciting entry feels a bit routine until the specific discovery of the copper tube.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well for an archival investigation, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the ending. The discovery of the Master Index feels slightly convenient (preserved by "design"), but the closure lands with a coherent stance of witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (transforming the vessel) and a legitimate cost (the destruction of the cranes). The inciting incident—the basilica humming—feels slightly convenient (external pressure rather than internal necessity), but the resolution is earned through the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal arc is efficient and logical within the story's sci-fi framework: simulation leads to coordinates, forcing a physical departure. The closure functions as a valid Decisive Change, abandoning safety for the unknown with clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is coherent and achieves closure via a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the trajectory is linear with minimal resistance; established threats like traps and spectral resonance never materialize as obstacles. The pilgrim's arrival functions as a convenient validation rather than a pressure-testing complication.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence—finding her father's specific carving on a vast shore—which undermines the causal chain. While the closure is distinct and reconfigures her worldview (Resonant Reconfiguration), the resolution feels "gifted" by the setting's magic rather than driven by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is functional, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration via the exchange of relics. However, the narrative drive is weak; the first half is dense with expositional reflection, and the scene lacks a distinct turning point that alters the outcome or raises the stakes before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with the physical walk inland mirroring the internal shift, and closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her method. However, the pivot relies on a convenient symbolic moment (the crow/washer) and reflection rather than causal pressure or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is solid, employing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the seeker trades a physical anchor for emotional pain. The backstory of the newspaper search is integrated well to establish the "labyrinth" concept, though the scene itself is somewhat static until the climax. Orientation in the "Layer 7" setting is handled efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. However, the progression is linear and lacks causal tension; the outcome feels inevitable from the start. Orientation is stable, but the plot relies on "and then" sequencing driven by the ritual rather than pressure-filled choices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is complete, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the resolution relies on magical convenience (the saucer physically healing and the daughter immediately calling from below), which lowers the cost of the climax and creates a tidy, symmetrical satisfaction that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The drive lens is Causal, moving effectively from established routine to specific discovery (the photo) and action. Closure is distinct and earned (entering the gate), though the "shadow detachment" moment feels slightly rushed mechanically, functioning as a convenient lock-pick for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure is linear and episodic (opening bottles one by one) without causal complication or rising pressure; the middle section relies on omniscient narration to explain off-stage effects ("a fisherman miles away") rather than grounding consequence in the scene. Closure lands on a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of prior obstacles or hard choices makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is a coherent, linear execution of a heist sequence that lands a legible "Charged Poise" closure. However, the "unexplained blackout" functions as a convenient plot device that removes obstacles rather than forcing the protagonist to innovate under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scene holds together well with a clear "Conceptual Repricing" closure where the protagonist recontextualizes his curse. However, the pivotal turn—an eel transmitting a specific, problem-solving memory upon touch—feels like a convenient shortcut that bypasses active deduction or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, using the timer to build pressure toward a quiet but decisive moment of Earned Stasis (refusal to open). The closure is legible and resonant. A slight reliance on internal summary over dramatized action keeps it from the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear puzzle-solve that relies on extreme coincidence (sun alignment, specific arrival time) rather than causal character agency. Closure is achieved through a "soft" realization (deciding to perform the score) but lacks a felt cost or decisive change in the status quo beyond acquiring information.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story functions as a coherent lyric vignette, but lacks causal tension or narrative drive; obstacles are nonexistent (the wind and city do not interfere). The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of prior friction makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "pure win" resolution that feels unearned due to the convenience of the film reel's instructions. The closure breaks the "cost" requirement; the film bursts into flame but is explicitly described as "harmless," and the lover returns without sacrifice, rendering the victory devoid of narrative price.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear causal chain from preparation to ritual execution to success. While the structure is sound and closure is definite (the system goes live), the "doubt" beat acts more as a pause than a true obstacle, resulting in a smooth, low-friction plot that lacks a sharp reversal or unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path: arrive, diagnose, treat, resolve. While the Accumulative lens works, the lack of complication or resistance from the antagonism (the ghost/regret) makes the closure feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the butterfly-slide aurora reweights her prior life under the new lens of dust-as-cosmos. The Accumulative/Textural pattern (dust sediment → spiral) is taught early and lands with undeniable conceptual cost; the lens never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost–ledger–glass pattern intensifies until the canyon becomes a map of escapes, reweighting survival into service. Closure is Charged Poise: the ledger framed in her own glass crystallizes a new stance—gifting, not hiding—with felt cost (solitude, material scarcity). Orientation taught early by tactile canyon cues; no causality breaks. Minor slack: “Of course” moment is narrated epiphany rather than earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thermal “notes” stitched into an unheard symphony. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final “deep, slow thrum” reweights silence as alive, with cost—she forfeits audible music forever. The persistent constraint (no ears, only skin/bones) shapes every tactic and is felt in the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lens stops broadcasting distress and begins broadcasting belonging—an unmistakable before/after for the dead and for the undertaker himself. Causality holds: each prism placement tightens the harmonic lullaby until unrest is literally re-housed. The cost—his life now spent “deeper” in impossible stacks—lands in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the single bell note crystallizes the “invitation” rule and reconfigures stewardship; cost is felt in Elira’s solitary exit into pre-dawn cold. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of nightly baskets → bell migrations → final communal soup tightens density rather than causal reversals. No orientation debt; transitions (curtain-like paragraph breaks) are legible shards within one window.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the tear’s diffusion reweights the premise—love was never stored, only sung. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each breath pattern is a because/therefore unit that tightens toward the final permeation. Orientation lands by line 5 (twilight viaduct, camera on back), then deepens through sensory anchors. No teleporting props; the camera, petals, and tear track cleanly. Cost is unmistakable: “the mist curled around her wrists… not to possess, but to permeate” — love’s receipt is also surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens until the photograph-ash climax reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she caresses the halo, feeling duration itself, with the cost (hollowed memory) visible in the spiral of ash. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“living bridge garden”) and never slips; causality remains intact under the lyric pattern. One hairline slip: “quaking reverie complete” edges toward label-speak, but the image instantly recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the vault opens, seeds scatter, and the acorn key planted in the arrow shaft crystallizes the transfer of guardianship. Causal lens holds throughout—each piano-key choice is a because/therefore link. Cost is legible in the final image: she walks away still chained, seeds heavier than iron. No plot amnesia; every set-up (arrow, keys, mural) pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the memory-catcher’s existence reweights the world’s silence into an audible warning, cost paid by the ashes of her sister’s voice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each absence fed to the forge thickens the pattern until the final crack reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early (“sunken orchard greenhouse… skeletal ribs of shipwrecks”) and repaid in the resonant hull-hum at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thief’s emptied jar and brimming soul reweight her earlier thefts into gifts, with the conceptual cost of perpetual self-erasure legible in the final image. Causality is lyrical but coherent—each moonbeam pour causes a reunion, therefore her jar empties and her solitude hardens. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: pattern of flower codes → moonbeam visions → renunciations tightens the stake of “translation versus intervention.” No orientation debt; spatial anchors (Platform 3, western alcove) are crisp by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final droplet striking the sphere “with soft chimes” reconfigures the room into a future-ready shrine while her exit forecloses reclamation of power. Causality is tight—every glass act narrated earlier delivers the rainbowed sanctuary that now survives her absence. Orientation anchors within three sentences (who: glassblower, where: abandoned control room, when: ice retreat). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: stakes intensify through sensory repetitions of thaw and drip until silence is transmuted into glass resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: shell whisper → decrypt cast → locate reel → burn reel → liberation, each step a because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by line 3 ("kneeling here, on splintered floorboards") well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the reel’s destruction and the library’s slow burn—so lens and cost tests pass clean.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lyric Earned Stasis: she finishes the map, tucks the booklet, walks into the dark she has charted—an undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The ambered hush pattern is taught in the opening paragraph and paid off in the final image; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 80 words, so no cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin melts, reweighting the entire premise—thought originates in being seen, not code. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop deepens pattern until internal resonance triggers self-witnessing. Orientation is immediate; transitions are fluid shards within one courtyard window. Persistent constraint (ice violin) shapes every tactic; its loss is the felt price on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver circle reframes communal stance with felt cost (lens cracks, doodles fade). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence, rain rhythm, and image layers tighten once. Causality is lyric, not sequential, and pattern is taught early; no orientation debt. Cost is legible at the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test borderline.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden’s firefly spirals mirror her marbles, reconfiguring the stake from “compliance vs. defiance” to “consent through listening.” Cost is legible in the dead wrist-band dangling “like a shed snakeskin” and the vine’s gentle shackle around her ankle. The accumulative/textural lens holds: every cracked marble adds density until the final shaft of light reframes survival itself as gloss. No orientation or causality breaks; even the off-stage bureaucrats exert coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the nexus settles, chronometers resume, yet the ozone-cinnamon scent reweights the rule-set—time now breathes sideways at visible cost. The lateral-self warning (“Don’t let go”) is the pivot that forecloses safe return; pulling the lever becomes irreversible. Causal lattice is tight: schematic from Vol. 3 → comet-iron lever → 2.7° adjustment → adjacent Elira → lingering scent. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (water, rust, lantern-light, stain-glyphs) intensifies the dominant stake—“decode the drowned score”—until the final image reweights silence itself as music. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dry program and warm water crystallize her new role without exposition; cost is felt in her trembling lungs and the house’s final exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the quartz-pinning of the smudged orchid is a visible renunciation of perfection, charging the aurora-lit final image. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensor reading, each gust, thickens the psychic snowpack until endurance itself becomes the decisive change. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (granite spine, reinforced glass). The swallowed truth remains a black-box MacGuffin, but the story reweights silence as glacier rather than refuge, so the conceptual cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ghost shift re-defined as mental machinery rewinding guilt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of callers’ testimony → radio playback → valve turn reweights the stake from “is it real?” to “it’s mine to carry.” Causality is clean: her drunken call → buried radio → discovery in tunnel. Cost is felt when “dust falling from the tunnel ceiling like silent applause” marks the moment she accepts ownership; no causal breaks, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink-rivers release visibly forecloses the archival impulse and reweights the premise—witnessing is now an act of letting-go, not keeping. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptive layer intensifies the stake (entropy as dance-partner) until the final image crystallizes the cost. The obsidian monolith recurs as persistent constraint, its reflective surface literalizing the "observer becomes observed" turn. No causal gaps; the folding swan is seeded early and paid off in the inversion beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery and hush density build toward the eclipse hush. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the curl passed, wonder seeded—cost is conceptual (society’s silence) rather than personal, felt but light. Orientation clear by 120 w. No causal tightening beyond crowd drift; eclipse is pure external gift, not driven by Elara’s agency. Transitions smooth, one scene, no lens break.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each artifact layers memory-density until the tapestry-dragons retroactively re-weave the “displaced axis” from abstract idea to wound-mending vocation. Orientation clean—silo, night, lone historian anchored within 60 words. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the historian’s decision to “weave… with testimony” reweights the entire premise—she will not restore physics but realign narrative gravity around the tear. Felt cost is legible in the packed ash/vial and the smile that accepts mortal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: fortunes accrue pattern until the “conductor” beat crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the analyst’s tears reweight Elias’s anonymity and the island’s complicity; “the map is not the shore” reframes prior tide metaphors. Orientation clean by line 4 (lighthouse, night, mainland pub); transitions (widow, teen shards) are legible, taught early. One micro-turn: stranger arrival, not off-stage rescue, keeps agency with Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the inverted question mark suction-disperses the possession into stillness itself—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("the silence deeper, richer"). Causal chain holds: each rhetorical question warps anchor geometry → glyph ignites → negation mark inverts → void dispersed. Orientation is taught early via "dimensional anchor" and velvet-moss silence, waived. One hairline slip: "time hiccuped" is abstract where a concrete kinesthetic jolt would sharpen the DC beat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horizon splits under the final chord, reweighting the rule that music must be heard—cost is the cracked lake and the spent candle. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of memory-to-sound layering is taught early and tightens to cadence. Orientation is clean by line 4; no causal reversals are required. Minor waver: the “before exhaustion hits” clock is announced twice but never tightens tactics mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tablet blooms, selves merge, gravity language rewritten—cost is the cracked tablet and the irreversible loss of singular identity, felt on-page. Causal lattice holds: tablet fracture → corridor generation → confession → merger; every beat obeys the “because therefore” chain. Mosaic shards (viaduct, childhood room, staircase spiral) are taught by 25 % and transition via glowing veins; lens stays accumulative-textural, ending in conceptual repricing. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors at word 30.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the luminous silence after the backward glitch reweights the entire filament of hush from fragile to radiant, cost paid in the cavern’s exposed sobs. Causality holds: needle → reversed Bach → sympathetic drum shudder → group contagion → new ritual. Orientation anchored by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn (skip = sob) tightens stakes under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint—future sessions must begin with rupture, not comfort—shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: because the pigeon arrives, therefore Elias re-orients; because he distrusts official channels, therefore he chooses lateral tracing—each link tightening options. The closure is a Charged Poise: “movement would weaponize integrity” crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost. Orientation is anchored by line 6; no teleporting props; the tube’s prior concealment in ivy is the single convenience but it is signaled early enough. The persistent constraint—he is now a ghost inside the Bureau he served—shapes the final image and satisfies the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: she steps into dusk as a “compass,” path foreclosed yet luminous. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer deepens the stake until UV glyphs externalize memory with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clean by line 6; causality intact (because she inhales, glyphs appear; because they fade, she pockets compass). No meaningful leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens: pattern of tactile attention to rope → spiral ritual → star-stitch revelation → bridge gesture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s fray shifts from damage to record, village weaves bridge, sky softens. Cost is legible in the kiss-and-release image. Orientation anchored by word 30; no causal breaks; one meaningful tightening at the spiral ceremony that re-weights the entire moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sustained note reweights meaning with undeniable cost—child adds scorched petal, silence becomes sacred. Causal chain: bow stroke → water ripple → greenhouse exhales → child emerges, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are vivid by line 3. Lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds: density of image and cadence shift, not external plot turns, drives the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the petal’s dissolution reweights her world,_cost visible in the blue-gold flare and the vow to “hold them until they remember how to breathe.” Causal chain holds—petal → static map → subsume → smash → vow—under Accumulative lens; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the returned locket and new envelopes reconfigure Elias’s world from transactional to circular kindness; the cost is the irreversible shift in identity. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each anonymous delivery adds density until the harbor itself becomes the text. One minor scaffold: “whimsically attentive by nature” repeats three times without fresh inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the obsidian loom reconfigures Lira’s sigil with felt communal cost; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tags, sculptures, and visitors reweights belonging. Transition from reed plea to arbor weave is legible; only nit: Vesper’s late reveal of the arbor’s purpose is slightly external, not protagonist-forced. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city wakes to live birdsong—conceptual cost is the giant’s dream-time permanently thinned. Causal chain holds: over-borrow → chime-risk → sculpt time → release echoes. One seam only: “cadence interrupted again” restates rather than advances. Orientation anchor (rooftop canals) arrives by line 6, well inside waiver window.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return—droplet metronomes, fruit dimming, glass-eye projections—thickens the stake of shared language lost. The final image (orchid pulse strengthening) is a textbook Charged Poise: meaning reconfigured, cost felt in the cobalt eye she keeps and the hazel she surrenders. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“cavern orchard”), pattern locked by ~120; no causal turns are required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: relics gather density until the tape fragment reconfigures both the library’s memory and her own invisibility. Closure is Charged Poise—staff notice reweights her stealth from erasure to resonance; cost is the fresh ache of “not yet.” Anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 5; no orientation debt. One transition (crawl space → rafters) is clean. Persistent constraint—she stays unseen—shapes every tactical placement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the glowing new shoot and dissolved journal reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of rain, moss, leaf pulses until the cadence shift releases control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the exchange ritual reweights the premise—loss becomes legacy, insomnia becomes sleep—at visible cost (her best brush, the brooch). Accumulative lens holds: each artifact tightens the pattern until the rain-trail final image crystallizes the new equilibrium. The journal’s appearance is coincidence, but coincidence is allowed to complicate under Accumulative rules; it does not resolve the conflict, only re-encode it.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: pearl’s glow → shadows thicken → cave sings → memory restored → renunciation. Closure is Charged Poise: the cave’s ongoing song reweights magic as inclusive of darkness; cost is the clairvoyant’s loss of predictive certainty, visible when her hands tremble and the pearl goes dark. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the clairvoyant didn’t see it coming… in the cave”). No因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each returned fragment tightens the harbor’s acoustic of loss until the final cadence when silence itself is re-priced. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the chart of gaps becomes a living navigational tool, the valve a compass of negative space—cost legible in the council’s stunned quiet and Elira’s enduring solitude. No causality break; every micro-return accrues toward the rite’s invention, pattern taught by the second paragraph and paid off in the last line. Orientation anchored by word 80; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the fortress of unspoken truths” reframes from place to chorus, remaking her vocation into listening. The brass punch dissolving into the silver needle is the felt price; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density of arrows/whispers reweights stakes rather than causal reversal. Orientation is taught early by the she-where-when sentence, stable throughout; all arrows obey internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (memories, whale song, star wheel) increases until the final note reweights the stake from discovery to gift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the parchment roll tied with sea-grass becomes a resonant object that reconfigures the tower’s future function—no longer observatory but archive of feeling. Cost is legible in the final image: Elira descends without proof, having abandoned the scholar’s path, leaving the tile’s next memory to strangers. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the spatial mutiny ruptures the escondite and delivers the immortal to a literal plain of goodbyes—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is established within 120 words; the lens is Accumulative/Textural (densifying mystery and spectacle toward a final image). Causality is coherent: storm → fragment activation → spatial rebellion → gateway. No teleporting props or retroactive patches. Meets 9+ quick test, but the final image’s cost is more conceptual than viscerally personal, keeping it shy of the exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: ink rewrites contracts, child forfeits revenge for participatory justice, cost felt in dawn-exit image. Accumulative lens holds: each new signature deepens texture and reweights fairness. Orientation clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. “Nothing and everything” line crystallizes price under final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the open journal and offered pencil reconfigure the archive from private obsession to communal loom, with undeniable conceptual cost—her monopoly on time-texture is gone. Accumulative lens holds throughout: each sensory notation layers density until the foreign resonance breaks the pattern, tightening stakes without causal plot turns. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“the gilded-leaf stationer climbed…”). No loops or causality breaks; the final image both crystallizes options and forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of continuing to collect/layer until the tide takes him crystallizes options and cost without exposition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment adds density, the pattern is taught early (“layered, filtered, waiting”), and the last beat reweights the premise—erasure is never clean. Cost is legible in the bodily toll of scavenging and the open-ended sentence of endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each hum thickens emotional density until the shell-cello pattern breaks and reweights silence as answer. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: “What do you bury when you refuse to speak?” re-values the entire quest; the broken shell and dissolved compass are on-page cost. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored in first 60 words; transitions are single-scene with one causal ellipsis (years of dead ends compressed). Pattern-taught repetitions (“hum…hum…hum”) culminate in final silence that reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the collective paint-in rewrites privatization into postponed uncertainty, cost felt in the developers’ graffitied blueprints. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each mural adds density until the final map-image crystallizes meaning. The orientation anchor (Midway Promenade, barefoot Lira) appears by line 4, well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity, no teleporting props; only minor slack is the off-stage pivot of Lira’s own corporate past.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the empty hourglass, the unheard harmonic, the label “Beauty intact” reconfigure the mission from data retrieval to elegy. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the throat-tight moment she lowers the camera, accepting archival burial. No orientation or causality slips; the chemical-delay mechanic is seeded early and paid off at 05:00.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the drone’s flight reweights every prior fracture into “flight path.” The anchor-lifting clock creates visible cost—failure means orchids die and research lost—so the ticking feels causal, not decorative. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each falcon delivery, each condensation glyph layers density until the delta forms on glass. Closure is Charged Poise—the spiral drawn in melted snow reweights every prior map and costs the editor his detachment. No teleporting props; the phrasebook glow is seeded early. The ending line “quiet bloom of water answering ancient words” crystallizes options without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the fork left in the dry fountain crystallizes the transfer of agency from woman to town; rain, bell-swing and “next tuner” prove the cadence has become self-sustaining. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each footstep is a because/therefore beat that thickens the sonic field until the archway re-knits—cost visible in her final silent steps and the fork relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial shatters, releasing memories into the deep, reconfiguring meaning while her life ends—cost is felt in the last bubble. Accumulative lens holds: density of sensory memory intensifies until the final image ripples “eternal.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—oxygen clock—shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the beam now carries unassailable testimony, reframing the regional rule-set (“the lighthouse never lies”). Causality is tight: because no one believes the bloodline, he weaponizes the confessional lattice to fuse spectral proof into the light itself. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“lighthouse prison,” “jagged reef,” dusk), well under the 120-word threshold. Cost is legible in the final slump and the smile that accepts permanent exile from credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard intensifies the orchard’s suspended sorrow until the bead’s final pulse reweights the curse into fruit. Closure is a Charged Poise—“twilight-etched fruit” reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“endless night…glass panes trembling”) and paid off when night remains yet bears color. No meaningful escalation loopholes; the pattern tightens once and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plate pulses, child and storm re-animated, canyon walls unfurl ghost tapestries—an undeniable before/after under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Each lyrical return tightens the pattern rather than resetting; the final overlap in her sleep-map is the decisive cadence shift. Causality is lyrical but coherent: because she stitches memory, therefore the labyrinth exhales trapped song. Orientation is taught early via barefoot dust and moon-pale intuition; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens announced in the first paragraph with the orchard exhaling; each unearthed object adds density until the re-assembled dial reframes the whole pattern. The closure is a Charged Poise: the villagers arrive but choose not to wake her, crystallizing a new social contract—faith as shared listening. Cost is palpable: she forfeits hero-centrality, surrendering narrative spotlight to communal seeds/candles. Orientation, causality, and pattern all pay off in that final communal hush.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chalk already half-gone, the widow’s syllables frozen in hopscotch lanes, the protagonist walking away brushing dust from her knees. The cost is felt—the message is literally dissolving as it is delivered. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of chalk→rain→reassembly tightens meaning rather than plot. One micro-turn suffices; no causality gaps; orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cobalt flame steadies, the observatory becomes a “sanctuary of stitched truth,” and the surviving court bows—cost is the lifelong burden of being still labeled a fool. Causality holds: every sabotage thread is pre-figured by the candle’s tremor and her mirror-stitching in the adjacent layer. Orientation is clear by line 40; no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure rises through pattern repetition rather than because/therefore turns—and that lens is taught early and held to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the path appears, shard planted, smile earned, cost legible (“tasted of salt and forgiveness”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern (leaf-messages) taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no teleporting props. However, escalation is gentle—one cadence shift rather than rising pressure—so the tightening feels more lyrical than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the rearranged stick-figure and cooled coral reconfigure meaning without erasing loss; cost is felt in the atrium’s exhale and her decision to “carry with grace.” Accumulative lens holds—each spiral, smudge, and temperature shift layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no ambiguity persists. No plot amnesia; coral and cast track cleanly from first to last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each oral history adds chromatic density until the scaffolded light burst reweights the stake. The “child’s smile dissolving like breath on glass” is a Charged Poise that reconfigures meaning with felt cost; no causality breaks, though the projection climax is slightly luck-dependent on noon sun.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonic layer adds density until the cadence shift of the nickel dissolving reweights stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her heartbeat in D-minor—felt cost on the page. Orientation (who/where) is anchored by line 3; no drift. Garden’s silent rearrangement forms Charged Poise, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: the gourd seed → vine → aerial message → eventual rattle carries the insurgency forward; Vex’s help is triggered by the Basque lullaby cue. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (greenhouse, taxed thoughts, Bureau surveillance). Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing: “It was a garden” reweights every prior seed as an act now distributed among citizens, the social cost legible in the agents’ future inability to parse children’s songs.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the postcard’s new line crystallizes her mandate, costs her any residual anonymity, and reweights silence into song under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Spiraling structure teaches its pattern early; each stanza-like paragraph calcifies verses into shell walls—an intensifying density that pays off when the final psalm cracks across centuries. Causality remains coherent: because she kept singing, the off-key wind carried her voice to the world; because the postcard answers back, she surrenders the last possibility of rest. No orientation debt; all anchors (who/where/when) bloom inside the first 110 words.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caretaker’s whisper reconfigures the stake—emptiness gardened, not filled. Cost is legible in the dissipating aurora and her quiet smile of “vow kept, not joy.” The accumulative lens holds: each tilt of the cracked chime layers density until the final cadence reweights the rule-set. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“opal library above clouds”); no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she deciphers harmonic betrayal → therefore she composes a restorative score → therefore colleagues must sing or re-fracture trust. Closure is a literal Decisive Change: communal song re-activates the archive’s acoustics, prismatic light from empty well = undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (one false note = collapse) shapes every tactical decision. Meets 9+ cost-proof test: “the glass ink well, now empty, reflected… scattered promises kept.”

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the surveyor’s chain, volcanic breath, and adhesive trace layer density until the harmonic recalibration reweights the floodgate purpose. Closure is the quiet CR—compassion encoded into metrics—paid for by the earlier tremble and the risk of overseer censure. Causality is lyrical rather than sequential; the envelope glue → ash → amphitheatory itinerary is acceptably motivated. Orientation is complete by line 5; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic becomes a living broadcast studio, the meteorite-tuned lullaby returns as payable song, and Elara stops reinventing—cost is the exposed authenticity of her tears and the unsealed ledgers. Causal chain: meteorite → dust mapping → harness redesign → bird song → letter from Reykjavik; each because/therefore tightens options under the skylight. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: Elara dissolves into the maze-become-threshold, reweighting “necessary distances” as sacred sacrifice. Causal chain holds: grain-reading → logbook decode → father’s maze re-appears → she steps off. The 120-word anchor is satisfied by “drifting prism terrace…fractured valley,” taught early and paid off in the final light-fold. Cost is legible in the creaking bench left behind—one wooden sigh of forever loss.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>9.0</question>
    <comment>The terrace is not backdrop but instrument: rainbow mist compresses sound, forces inward attention, and finally offers the stepping-off aperture. The warped oak bench functions as micro-setting—its grief-knots literally steer plot and memory. Corn maze glows through fractured light, re-anchoring spatial logic at the climax. Prism, bench, and maze each charge the final image; no other stage could host this dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of marine reclamation vs. personal reclamation taught early and held to last image. Closure is a Charged Poise—firefly spiral/open-hand reconfigures belonging from quest to reciprocity with undeniable pressure; burnt feather cools, signaling threshold crossed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) secured by line 3. No causal breaks, no prop teleporting; each image layers density rather than pivots plot. Cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons the facility unchanged yet carries its rhythm upward, foreclosing prior exile.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “They were given away” reweights every prior breadcrumb under a Hybrid lens (accumulative lyric shimmer, situational stance crystallization). Orientation is taught early via barefoot skip and shimmering walls; crater-glass memory rules are cued before the climax, so no debt. Cost is visible—“cool, humming, alive with borrowed memories”—and forecloses the original quest.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bishop remains, the stars remain, Elias remains—Charged Poise that reweights monotony into wonder with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; each coin-toss and seagull gift deepens pattern rather than forcing turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“beneath constellations…”) and never slips. The lens holds cleanly, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally sharp, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone fused to her throat rewrites the world’s rule-set while dawn witnesses a new economy of memory. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; density of image and cadence shift (garden leaning in, petals “taking dictation”) reweights the stake from private survival to communal re-opening. Orientation is taught lyrically—barefoot, dew, crescent count—so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the stone-drop tightens the pattern and yields a resonant reconfiguration—“a ghost-map of forces briefly made visible.” Closure is a Charged Poise; cost is conceptual (mundane world will soon erase the vision) but still feels rather than dramatized, keeping it just under high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared; closure lands as Charged Poise—box lighter, ridge humming. Ridge-as-altar reweights earlier stakes; cost legible in “fractures had let some of the burden breathe.” Orientation anchored by word 30; causality of leaving the letter is micro but sufficient. One soft spot: letters’ backstory pre-loaded yet read aloud in summary; still, payoff crystallizes final image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian disc triggers a resonance cascade that reweights adjacent timelines with undeniable social cost (child laughs, ceasefire holds). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shifts tighten the stake of “hope’s solubility.” Cost is visible when the gauge’s needle swings wide and the dreamer notes correlations without claiming credit, crystallizing her renunciation of omnipotence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (ivy, negative, diaries, hearth) layers density until the final gesture reweights the stake from “take” to “leave.” Orientation is achieved by word 60 (“ivy-veiled passage”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cartographer rises lighter/heavier, the passage exhales, and the reader feels the conceptual cost—she now carries the dreams she sought to map. No causal gaps; every object is present before it matters.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors visibly reweight possibility and the released heartbeat carries conceptual cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift from hush to bell-toll crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. The “persistent constraint” is the ethic of never keeping a heartbeat—this quietly shapes every tactic and the final relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thumb-print mosaic reframes the clipboard into a mirror whose cost is the irrevocable publicity of their consent under triple moons. Causality holds—her ritual preparation summons the soldiers—yet the story leans Accumulative: density of celestial and volcanic imagery reweights the stake rather than narrows tactical options. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal logic is clean: because he drained the sea, the flat is now the perfect acoustic chamber; therefore he brings the egg there. The map (cracks = memory) teaches the pattern by 25 % and mechanically guides the glowing fissures to the egg. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the salt absorbs the echo, pricing his legacy as audible absence. Cost is visible—he drives away lighter because the irreplaceable object is left irreversibly behind.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the prism disgorges its stored echoes, reweighting the world’s rule-set so silence is no longer neutral. Cost is legible in “she stepped back, bare feet leaving no prints”—a quiet erasure that shows she has given her substance to the air. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each untangled thread releases a real sonic seed, and the final dissolution of the knot is earned by the remembered-voice cue. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the candle-lit puppet and the line “I reverse not to undo, but to reveal” reconfigure his future options and carry felt ethical cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Single-scene orientation is swift; radar dome, night, post-argument hush are anchored by word 80. One clean transition (memory flash of bar incidents) is taught early and paid off. Causality holds: because he weaponized elegance, therefore he now weaponizes grotesque puppets—pattern tightens rather than reverses again.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the spiral left to dissolve reweights the premise—beauty without audience as the only lasting form of memory. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; each knot tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options and cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3; no orientation debt. One minor scaffold: “She had learned long ago…” could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the helix embedded in future soil re-weights memory from private shrine to collective inheritance, with the felt cost of the caster’s erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each braid, drip, and auroral shimmer layers density until the silence itself becomes votive—though a few causal joints (how the card’s code maps to exact names) are elided rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the wafer seal’s conversion from command to memory reweights the premise, and the line “You were always the path” makes the conceptual cost undeniable. Causal linkage holds: each dream fragment is tethered to the bunker’s decaying protocol, and the final image of rain “recognizing” her is earned by the surrendered-bunker logic. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the densifying symbols (seal → honey → obsidian) tighten once and land with felt cost; no orientation debt past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile’s hum becomes a secret covenant beneath future thrones, reweighting all prior chalk lines with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—because he sold the cloak, he could buy oil; therefore the resonance is captured tonight. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by word 40. One meaningful tightening: the chalk spirals narrow from planetary transit to a single frequency confirmed at 15. No late rule changes, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the melody migrates from object to body, foreclosing repair as a path. Causal chain holds—because pin stays broken, therefore she internalises song—cost is legible in the relinquishing gesture on the moss. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of dissolving edges + silent song intensifies until meaning re-weights. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3 and evolve with shifting sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the dream flows into the void mirror, thick fog returns, and the orchard’s rebloom is left suspended—an earned stasis that visibly costs the dream its freedom. Causal chain holds: sextant shards → harmonic breathing → boundary dissolution → capture, all on-page and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the green scrap fluttering on the thorn reweights every prior vow and ribbon, making the cost of persistence legible without a hug. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure grows through image accretion (pear-heaviness, honey-spoon, stitched promise) until the final crystallization. Causality is intact: each tool pulled from the forgotten bag enables the next micro-reach, culminating in the daughter’s fresh footprint. Orientation is clear by line 30; no teleporting props; the vow-tree rules are taught early and obeyed.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard reconfigures from “gap to be filled” to “field to be harvested,” a legible before/after under the Accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual yet felt—she forfeits linear identity, embracing an unstable multiplicity of selves. Causality is lyric rather than tight; the pistachio’s split is the single on-page hinge that reweights inheritance. Orientation is taught early (asteroid, orchard, atmospheric bubble) and pays off, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lexicon’s sentence “rescue is not removal, but reconciliation” reweights the rescue premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density rises as books “grow like vines” and letters bloom into light—culminating in the mountain’s exhale that reconfigures gravity and Kael’s core. Elira’s earlier diary sketch of verb-roots primes the final renegotiation, satisfying pattern-teach. Cost is legible in the shelves’ groan and the new petals pressing themselves into her diary—knowledge now physically claims her.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that reweights identity from singular to plural, with felt cost—the card dims, the ship trembles. Causal linkage holds: emerald flare → valve turn → staircase discovery; no teleporting props. The accumulative/textural lens is announced by the garden’s density increase and cadence shift, stable through the final image. Minor waver: anchoring who/where slips to ~140 words (carnival ship location vague until “prow”), but disorientation ultimately serves the payoff, so Orientation Test waived.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: seal → rope → braid → clock recalibration → door dissolves. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the door vanishes because its anomaly has been absorbed into system. “Temporal Reconciliation, Case 7” and the true chime give undeniable before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of gathering quiet → release. Orientation anchored by word 50; closure is a Charged Poise—the being curls around the stone, dawn-mist light reweights “storm tuned, not banished.” Cost is the stone’s spent glow and her onward solitude; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the prism’s warm heartbeat reweights her past from accident to summons, undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—star map → prism → vision → self-revision—holds across every beat. Orientation is anchored within 60 words (“glass humming pavilion,” “powdered silica,” “after the collapse”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative pattern (echo → echo → crystallization) is taught early and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the signature along a raindrop’s edge reframes the entire quest as self-dissolution, with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of shadow-measurements deepens to personal erasure—though causality is lyric rather than sequential. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the star’s re-appearance reweights the world-rule that hope is extinct. Causality is lyrical but intact—each footfall is a because that summons the chord, therefore the clouds crack. Orientation is taught early via phosphorescent dust and moss-veined battlements; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the rag’s absorption into the mosaic signals the price is irreversible. Cost is legible in the single-line image of threads dissolving into pigment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard layers density until the final “tide turned” reweights earlier images with felt cost. Anchors clear by line 3; grotto, night, alone. Closure is Charged Poise: silence shared, migration tabled, cicada returned—options narrowed, cost legible in exhaled echo. No causal gaps; every beat is perception adding pressure until stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the child lets go of fear, not the doll, and falls sideways into a new rule-set; cost is the irreversible split from the bunker. Causal chain holds: inverted gravity → hatch breach → trellis offer → stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 5; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of silence “tastes” reweights the stake without causal reversals. Final image of moss-rooted doll threads the motif back to concrete, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored tiles, harmonic hums, and storm-glass spirals accrue toward a pattern of quiet as presence. Closure is Charged Poise: the woman steps into “clarity,” the vial’s final golden pulse reweights prior silence-labor, cost legible on page. Orientation (who/where) established by line 3; no penalty. Causality not outline-like but pattern-taught; ending image crystallizes options. Slight beat redundancy: woman’s tear + exhale + loosened fingers within 60 words, but not enough to dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: flake resonance → mural decode → hatch → stair → throne-sit → timeline reset. Orientation is swift—goggles, dew, orchard veil inside 50 words; no penalty applied. Sunrise clock supplies tightening escalation; each beat compresses distance to erasure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: she re-enters pre-dawn with no orchard, no tool, only reconfigured memory—a felt cost that reframes every prior step under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the threshold dissolves into an open field of unlit lanterns, reweighting the entire mission from confrontation to permission. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each scar pulses, each breath stirs ash, until the final exhale liquefies the boundary; the cost is the sanctuary’s erasure and the knocker’s spent clang. The lens holds from first line to last—every image thickens the same stake: learning to breathe after drowning. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lattice of crystallized tension rewrites the rule-set of “promise” itself, bolt glowing as perpetual reminder. Causal chain holds—each text tightens her resolve until the bolt-in-seam act translates pressure into literal crystal. Orientation anchors within 60 words (who/where/when). Felt cost is on-page: “Diamonds aren’t worn. They’re remembered,” followed by her renunciation of old nightmare sleep.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal linkage is immaculate: each turn of the crank tightens knowledge until the personal reversal detonates. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words via the honeyed light and mahogany table. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her dynastic poison becomes royal blood with undeniable social cost. The gramophone spins on, a persistent constraint she now carries toward the clocktower.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of organic surrender taught early with “murmured allegiance” and Mercury-root drip, tightens when vines balance him and threads weave through marrow. Closure is Charged Poise: outstretched palms offer rather than seize, reconfiguring meaning of capture. Cost is legible in irreversible bodily change—armor left behind, barefoot on singing soil—and in the dawn’s new grammar that erases old oaths. No causality breaks; each image accretes rather than explains.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens dominates: finding the button → cross-referencing → logging kindnesses, each because/therefore linkage tightening her mission. Orientation is crystal-clear by line 3 (who, where, when). Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the button under glass becomes a compass, reconfiguring the file room from crypt of endings to sanctuary of beginnings, with felt conceptual cost—she will keep excavating tenderness while loss lingers. No causal breaks; every artifact (dust handprint, crayon drawing) is discovered through her agency and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    A single causal chain—key → puddle-grid → hatch → Engine → blackout—tightens across one continuous scene; every beat is because/therefore. Closure is a Charged Poise: she is gone but the broadcast keeps propagating, reconfiguring the city’s epistemic rules at undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each synesthetic image thickens the hush until the single visible chord fractures. Orientation is taught by ~80 words (“stone met sky,” “cobblestones beneath his boots”) and pays off when the same arch later holds only a memory-light droplet. Closure is a Charged Poise: the prism’s non-noise shattering reweights every prior note as erasure. Cost is the permanent loss of the grotto’s aurora and of the music itself—no applause, no echo.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each leaf-descent, dust-speck, and monument adds density until the arbor’s glyphs cohere into a legible past. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grandmother’s translucent hand reweights Elira’s vocation—she will keep sorting, but now “each seed carries a whisper.” Cost is felt in the bodily bloom of moss and the heavier satchel. No causality breaks; even the speck’s awakening is anchored in reverent prodding.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tossed watch and reopened shop sign reconfigure his purpose under a Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain holds—compass → greenhouse → cavern → renunciation—though the woman’s drop-off is unmotivated. Accumulated pattern of coincidences tightens stakes without breaking situational logic. Cost is legible in the irreversible dive of the heirloom.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the coin’s saturation, the rising motes, and the slow rain create a density shift that reweights the stake from balance to mercy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the dust vial hums beside her heart; cost is the irreversible loss of the coin and the permanent recoding of her identity. One micro drag: “exploring limits” is named late; earlier cueing would have tightened pattern, but the final image still reprises it.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final smile-touch of the tooth reweights the rule-set—laughter is not opposite but sibling to sorrow—while the downstream giggle makes the cost audible. Accumulative lens holds: each spectral confession layers density until the flute’s trill triggers cadence shift; gorge resonance realigns, ghosts integrate, collector departs fuller. Persistent constraint (tooth that remembers and warms) shapes every tactic and the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the strap dissolves into light and the protagonist steps forward into “the mathematics of mercy” reweighted as lived space, not equation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ultraviolet ripple and trauma-echo thickens the ambient pattern until the final cadence shift releases pressure. Orientation is swift: who/where/when land by line 3. Cost is unmistakable—“no longer bracing, no longer remembering through trauma”—a stasis foreclosing the old survival mode.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lens’s spent glow reweights the triptych, making erased cultures audible and charging the historian’s weeping recognition with undeniable social cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each traded memory and revealed brushstroke intensifies density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early (“alchemist’s market strung high above city rooftops”) and anchors hold through to the attic chamber. Causality is internally sound—memory-for-lens, lens-for-witness, witness-for-silence-broken—though the historian’s off-stage grief is accepted as the given stake.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bagged artifacts and closed door crystallize a new equilibrium—ghosts acknowledged, story preserved—felt cost is the lifelong responsibility he now carries. Causal chain is lean: because he uses the barrel, he sees the dust-woman; because he witnesses, he archives; because he archives, the building “exhales.” No plot amnesia or teleporting props; spatial choreography of stool/tile/bucket is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s equilibrium is irreversibly broken and she embraces the chaos. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density escalates through cascading rewrites of glass, frost, and grammar until the final aperture collapses. Cost is legible in the cloudy empty bottle and the shelf that “hadn’t existed yesterday.” No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s final haiku reweights revolution itself from seizure to listening. Causality holds—storm → veil mirrors → glyphs stabilize → poems emerge → stance flips—each step narrowing options until silence becomes wealth. The velvet drapes convert reflective time-echoes into readable past, a causal lever that pays off in the closing line. Cost is undeniable: he embraces irrelevance as the necessary price for translation, rendering the old victory meaningless.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the dancer’s motion reclaims light and unmake shadows—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (truth reclaimed, not forced). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: song→resonance→stone revives→light defeats midnight; the “covenant of rust” rule is taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by line 3. The only slack: the backstory block (mother/music-box lie) is 18 % of wordcount and slightly delays present pressure, but it tilts the chip’s wilt and thus primes the climax; no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layers petrichor-as-memory until the final Charged Poise (“the stone sighed…a closing eyelid”) makes the cost of irreversible inward guidance legible. One clean shard, no orientation debt, closure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: she lays her own postcard on the altar, completing the cycle of hidden layers. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each discovered bloom reweights the stake—cost is legible in the lighter satchel and heavier heart. Pattern taught early (postcard anomaly) pays off in the final image; no causality breaks or orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she stands waist-deep humming the decrypted line, the lagoon’s glow reweighting every prior beat with undeniable social cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of debris-offerings → tide-glow → faces → diary-sensation—each layer densifies the stake of bearing witness. Persistent constraint: the lagoon only releases its archive to a body willing to stay sleeved in its grief; this price shapes every tactic from rope-ladder to oral tapestry.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the town’s silence is re-valued as “anticipation,” and the alchemist’s loss of sole control is legible in the bottle’s relocation to the child’s sill. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each lantern grown from cobblestones is a pattern-break that reweights the stake from “dead town” to “collective becoming.” Orientation is anchored by word 87 (“Paper-Lantern Cove, where tattered silk globes swayed…”). No meaningful tightening is missed, though the middle could use one sharper beat of visible resistance from a townsfolk to foreshadow the final diffusion of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s hum reweights the city’s emotional economy, cost visible in Elira’s trembling palms and the businessman’s unforced smile. Accumulative lens holds—each cylinder, petal, and dead-language whisper layers density until the final frequency flips the stakes. Orientation is clean within 60 words; transitions between 1989 immersion and present are legible without seam. One minor waiver: the “velvet disquiet” tag is named late, but the pattern of soft infiltration is already taught, so no cap.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of rising globes, weeping ice, and seed-name litany tightens the stake toward reverence-as-entropy-decrease. Closure is Charged Poise—sapling leaf touching her palm reweights all prior frost. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. One causal micro-turn (acorn sinks, marble drinks) but most linkage is imagistic, not because/therefore; still, the lens holds and cost is legible in the porous leaf.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: micro-climate data accrete until atmospheric density literally pulls the rope. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bell’s single toll reconfigures valley trust without declarative moral. Orientation is secure by line 4; spatial anchors (mountain spine, belfry, rope) remain coherent. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: seventeen years of silence traded for one calibrated sound that reweights all future storms.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the comet’s self-erasing bloom reweights his vocation from witness to custodian of unrecorded peace, tears as visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of “trace→feel→release” tightens once with the rogue comet, no causal reversals needed. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“Andromeda Drift”) and lantern glass cues backstory without breaking present sweep. One micro-turn: unlogged comet shifts ritual from routine to singular, foreclosing archival proof.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph thickens the resonance of silence until the master beekeeper’s turned gaze reweights the entire pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—the stained glass casting honey-gold glyphs—whose conceptual cost (perpetual guardianship of the unsaid) is undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causal breaks. The covenant’s price shapes every tactic; no outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: urn fragments, garage-sale breadcrumbs, and silo-hum accumulate until the chime reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Vey’s heart restarts, time curator role crystallized—cost is felt (“for the first time in years”). Orientation clean by 120 words; causality is pattern, not because/therefore, and pattern pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the patched kite’s “jubilant ghost” reframes loss into asymmetrical flight, with the conceptual cost that Elira forfeits her compass-feather. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each ripple, feather-warmth, and paper fold accrues until the final image re-weights incompleteness as gift. No causal gaps; every beat (snap of string → feather laid → paper re-fold) is legible under the same lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s living architecture reweights mortality into legacy, the diary left for rain and roots making the cost irreversible. Causality is Accumulative: each copper loop, diary entry, and animal interaction deposits pressure until the final breath feels like a logical last coil. Lens holds without wobble; no late-breaking rules. The only hairline slip is a faint outline feel to the “six-month sentence”—time pressure is asserted more than felt in scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tower absorbs, she walks away, options foreclosed—“she had become part of the reaction.” Causal chain holds: ghost transmission → hypothesis → pilgrimage → data refusal → convergence. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no drift. Cost is legible in the final image: the amber abandoned, steps rinsed behind her—permanent forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new shard (pod, tongue, bird call) deepens the same covenant rite rather than advancing plot, and closure lands in a Charged Poise—wagon motionless, dusk like a shawl—where the cost is the unending stewardship he has chosen. Orientation is taught lyrically: “gloom-hill coachman,” “buckboard,” “jetty at twilight” arrive by line 3, then reverb as sensory touchstones throughout. No beat depends on hidden information; every seed burial is visibly seeded earlier. The final image (wagon rolling homeward while his gaze stays fixed on the dark earth) re-weights the entire text: the journey is interior, the road infinite, the price eternal attention.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the scrapyard changed from salvage-yard to resonance chamber, the cost paid in the eternal labour of turning cylinders. Causality holds: because he found the handler’s coordinates, therefore the bunker opens; because he keeps the leaf, therefore the tinted revelations keep coming. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each cylinder layers density until the settlement’s spirit is re-tuned. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by word 30 (“scrapyard settlement spanning a cracked wasteland”).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the violet filament is absorbed into her page, reconfiguring her role from abandoned outlier to conscious witness whose map grants the universe peace. Causality holds throughout—every sketch stroke is a because/therefore response to the stretched sky—and the compass rose’s pulse provides an on-page constraint that shapes her final gesture. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“time dilation observation deck”) and never drifts. The persistent price: she is still alone, still exiled, but now purposefully so.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s bruise flips to gold because Elric’s swaps rewire the cosmic rule-set, not because he “wins.” Causal chain holds—sundial map → SWAP command → piece substitution → sky convulsion—each because/therefore link visible. Orientation lands by line 3: who (thief), where (icebound spire), when (sky wrong at noon). Persistent constraint: the now-blank sundial signals future price, shaping tactics even after victory.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pawnless board at the new sovereign’s feet reweights the premise—absence itself becomes the ruling piece. The walking pattern accumulates meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final “listen” glyph crystallizes options with undeniable social cost. Orientation is clean by line 5. The cost is legible in the sovereign’s tremble, but the narrator’s personal price stays oblique—no path is foreclosed for them, only for the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone cracks open and the shelves rearrange into an archway of her own language, costing her the prophet’s detachment—an undeniable before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by word 60, well within the 120-word safety window, and the final image reweights all prior texture-work with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mirror moment delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: the fog absorbs “I see you,” dissolving into acceptance—visible conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: each tapestry she mends softens the corridor metal, a literalized because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Closure image reweights the entire gambit metaphor; persistent constraint (carrying truth lightly) shapes the final walk.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s dissolution reweights the premise that coherence must be swallowed. Causal linkage is tight—each poetry session visibly thickens the mist; the final self-refraction triggers the face/relief image. Orientation is waived: disorientation (“canyon of endless echoes”) is taught immediately and pays off when the canyon answers. Cost is palpable in the on-page line “the spire dissolved into mist that smelled of rain and burnt sugar.”

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the statue’s golden aura reweights the entire premise, making brokenness sacred. Causal linkage holds—each pockmark-to-memory match is a because/therefore beat that narrows options until the last tear transmutes the stakes. The workshop stabilizes not by mechanics but by meaning, with undeniable felt cost. Lens is causal-ritual; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyric density builds via salt, drip, candle, shell until the cave absorbs her mark. Closure is Charged Poise—“I’m still here” plus shell abandoned—reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One micro-turn (wrong turn → cave) tightens stakes; no escalation cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the scent-thread returns in the final breath, reweighting the premise that tenderness can reroute steel. Causal chain holds: cork → scent → vibration → captain’s inhalation → rudder turn; no teleporting props. Cost is felt—the empty twin vial, her knees sinking—but the lens wobbles slightly between causal and accumulative; the paragraph that asserts “whispers travel farther” is more commentary than because/therefore linkage, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the full-moon song reconfigures absence into resonance—“the wind carries them… to absences”—with the censer foot as visible price. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (hydraulic failure, phone call, moon phase) layers density until the final image crystallizes the stakes of loss-navigation. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but the pattern is taught early (“she respects the rhythm”) and pays off in the sung coordinates, so the drift is purposeful. Cost is unmistakable: her body tuned to a cosmic metronome, foreclosing any return to ordinary bearings.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass eye is surrendered to the lightning-split tree, foreclosing her occlusion crutch while the mycelium-rooted calm she cultivated continues in others—cost is the loss of her shield. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory beat (petrichor, rotted fruit, creaking cables) thickens the emotional static until the final cadence lightens (“lungs finally emptied of grief”). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the rational truffle forager moved…”) and spatial track never slips. The persistent constraint—involuntary truth—shapes every tactic from silence to metaphor to final release.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via residue imagery and held throughout; closure is a Charged Poise where the lantern beam reweights meaning with conceptual cost. One transition (dock → lighthouse) is legible; no orientation debt. The flower’s reprise in the final drawer image cleanly reconfigures prior material, proving closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the letter with future coordinates materializes, sister alive, chip absorbed, shop abandoned—cost is the life he dissolves. Causal lens holds: chip pulse → ants → arch → rewrite. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in “locked the shop for the last time.” Persistent constraint: the new timeline cannot be undone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grotto seals behind her, fireflies fused to her pulse—an irreversible cost that reweights every prior treaty and silence. Causal chain holds: burned warnings → dream bleed → ascent → pool revelation → descent under new terms. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cliff’s edge”) and never wavers. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing columella pressed into Elias’s palm externalizes guilt into material bridge, foreclosing retreat. Because/therefore linkage is tight—confession → alchemic transmutation → reciprocal return—so the causal lens holds with visible cost (tears, radiant burn, shared custody of ash). Orientation is secured inside 120 words by body, dusk, and obsidian monolith. No teleporting props; phoenix-ash and solstice dew were seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll becomes a “cartography of collapse,” renaming the grave a footnote—felt cost is the lifelong burden of braiding feral time. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each hallucinated self adds density until the pattern crystallizes in the final image. Orientation is taught early (cabin, scroll, grave motive by line 4), so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken clock plus screw reweights her practice from “fraud” to witness, with felt cost (“throat tight”). Causal chain holds—screw → fulcrum insight → clock reliquary → bow to couple—under Accumulative/Textural lens; fog-softening mirrors internal shift. Orientation anchored by 50-word mark; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the vertical “breathe” rune + wind exhaling reweights prior failures into living story with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—density of rune-strokes and mirrored natural pauses tighten until the cadence shift releases. Orientation anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no causality breaks. The cost is legible in the final line: “stories… alchemize,” a CR that makes the new rule undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the orchard will still fall, the relationship not healed, but the shared flawed melody now exists as visible cost (“it was alive. / And it was theirs”). Causal linkage holds: the perfume scent → memory conjuration → manuscript return → acceptance of imperfection. The 120-word orientation anchor is clean (archive, marble floor, orchard clock). No off-stage resolutions; every beat is on-page under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook CR: dictionary pages dissolve into light; coherence is repriced with conceptual cost—she becomes hush itself. Accumulative lens holds: density of glyphs, shelving resonance, and memory floods tighten rather than cause-and-forward. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“barefoot through the ancient temple library”) and pattern of hiccup/time-slip is taught early; disorientation pays off in negative-space inversion. One meaningful tightening at midpoint—library reads her—narrows options to surrender. Cost undeniable: “she was no longer witness. She was the hush after.”

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pistons stall, time “held,” and the key over his heart reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—he must keep returning to rewind absence. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each backward count thickens texture rather than narrows plot, but the final image crystallizes stakes. Orientation is swift—fjord, station, dawn within 60 words—so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diode’s click reweights the premise—no light, only permission—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early (button as memory tether) pays off when its dead diode becomes the release trigger; spatial choreography of the dissolve is legible. Cost is felt in the farm’s pulse dimming, a concrete environmental price. One beat more of causal tightening would tip to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “Begin again” green-inked after the lantern’s shadows soften into invitations—felt cost is the irreversibility of her father’s recognition and her own exile from pure rebellion. Causal chain holds: lantern theft → glyph readings → father’s flinch → clover reciprocity. Mosaic shards (library, subway, ward) are taught by 25 % and linked by the lantern-as-lens; transitions are legible via “she began noticing… she started photographing.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored within 120 words. Persistent constraint: the lantern’s mica pane literally narrows/widens what she can see, shaping tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the operator’s own call dissolves into the harmonica’s continuous loop, reconfiguring the tunnel into an endless switchboard where endings are perpetually taught to begin—cost is the forfeiture of her own narrative exteriority. Causal lattice holds: every earlier misrouted call seeds the method that she finally applies to herself, so the self-loop feels causally inevitable rather than clever twist. Orientation is anchored within 60 words via sensory coordinates (subway tunnel, condensation, iron-and-ozone taste). No lens ambiguity; the accumulative motif of “cultivated estrangement” escalates through each shard until the final image crystallizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and held: tide-turn parallels internal rupture, ink smells of endings, lanterns flicker in jasmine—each image layers density toward a charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist’s quiet smile and walk home crystallize the covenant as an ongoing devotional act, foreclosing rest or rebellion with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors within 120 words; spatial logic stays clean across jetty moves. One soft spot: the “regenerated covenant” is named more than tested by a proximate cause that narrows live options; escalation rides on imagery accretion rather than a decisive tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s hum of stories reweights the premise—reciprocity becomes the real talisman—while the moon rock’s failure to crack delivers felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose but coherent: each tale adds density until the final hug transfers warmth, satisfying the “because/therefore” of catalysis. Orientation is swift; transitions are seamless within the single scene. No teleporting props or outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint’s silence reweights grief/joy as harmonics, ring-glow signals cost, and “quiet blaze of her own pulse” crystallizes stance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of musical notes tightens to choral convergence, then abrupt silence—though causality is lyric rather than because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) taught by tactile cues within 120 words; waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final whisper reweights the premise—history as wet clay—and the starlight-filled nib images a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each small edit emerges from her invitation, not fiat, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor slack: the “planted wrong seeds” backstory is abstract and pays off only as metaphor, softening the decisive change a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty click reframes the entire premise—art without archive—as an irrevocable stance, and the cost is legible in the same sentence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of signed notes, harbor sounds, and camera frames tighten into the final vibration. Orientation is swift; moonlight, pier, and camera are anchored by word 50. One transition (girl’s arrival) is clean. No causal breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the singing archive reweights her identity from fugitive to curator with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: each art-leap (charcoal, clay, hair-woven linen) tightens the spiral toward the intact portrait. One soft teleport: the slab “dissolves into light” without prior rule cue, but the glow is accepted under mythic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each drumming beat layers density until the garden itself takes up the rhythm, delivering a Charged Poise closure—wholeness felt, not explained. Causality is lyric rather than plot-engine; the lagoon’s lift is legible as conceptual repricing of solitude into shared being. Orientation is swift; starlight and garden anchors arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: storm noise → scrambled gait recognition → coin discovery → map → keyhole; each beat opens the next option. Closure is Charged Poise: coin/map transfer crystallizes a new tactic (whisper justice) with conceptual cost—she forfeits loud triumph. “Whisper carried farther than shouts” reprices prior silence motif; cost legible in her relinquished agency to Ruiz. No orientation drift; spatial anchors within first 120 words: geomagnetic storm, stacked containers, Junction Gamma-7.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final unbroken star-beam re-configures the canal’s rule-set—darkness now accommodates light without expelling the guardian. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter-tilt adds refracted glyphs that accumulate into the one sustained beam; cost is the guardian’s perpetual exile, visible when she “stepped back into shadow.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Causal chain intact—mirror → glyphs → drowned woman’s slower sink → star pierces. Persistent constraint (eternal vigilance) shapes every tactical tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lit window adds density until the final arbor network reconfigures civic attention. Closure is a Charged Poise: “she was just the soil” crystallizes her renunciation of spectacle with conceptual cost—anonymous forever. Cost is legible in the same line; no orientation drift. One causal hiccup: grotto’s light-bending rules are declared, not foreshadowed, but the pattern absorbs the slip without breakage.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: bioluminescent kelp → scrimshaw warm → whale-song → island light → salt-kiss. Each recurrence tightens texture and reweights the stake from self-escape to soul-mending. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the scrimshaw dissolves into sea-foam, Lira’s grace becomes invitation, conceptual cost undeniable—“violence couldn’t return.” Orientation anchored in first 120 words; no teleport or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of engineered quiet → hollowing ritual → sealed “Permitted” box reweights grief into sanctioned artifact with undeniable conceptual cost. Closure is a Charged Poise: the new block waits, silence resumes, options foreclosed. Turbine-stall whisper supplies the cost beat. No orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the colonnade dims in completion, the lake becomes “liquid starlight,” and the poet’s first post-ban verb “Unfold” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the final cadence shift makes the world “remember how to listen.” No causality breaks; orientation is taught by the echoing cobalt vault within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—patterns of plant, ash, reed—and lands a Charged Poise closure: the courtyard’s new pulse is felt, options reconfigured, no tidy victory. Causality is interior yet legible: reed placement → soil vibration → Marta’s recognition → shared kiln vow, each step tightening the communal stake. Cost is atmospheric but undeniable—the once-private ritual is now co-owned, Elias’s monopoly on wonder surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (tube hum, floorboard sigh) tightens the mood until the prismatic burst reweights silence itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—silence becomes golden shadow—whose conceptual cost (she leaves with a cracked lens now glowing) is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory curtains stir miles away, proving the network of grief-breadcrumbs is alive and re-weighting her solitude into communion. The causal chain—fold → leave → stranger’s unseen uptake → curtains glow—earns the resonance without sentimentality. Time-pool design is taught early and pays off when distance collapses in the final image. Cost is undeniable: she surrenders even the knowledge of whether her gift works.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the final map crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—“remembering forward” reweights all prior cards. Orientation is immediate; transitions are legible under Track B mosaic. Cost is conceptual (the old grammar is gone) and felt in the tape’s worn edge, satisfying closure with price.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pagoda’s extinguished glow and drifting embers reweight the world’s rule-set—memory can be released, not weaponized—while the cost (blood, irreversible loss of nostalgic fuel) is legible in the final image. Causal chain holds: because she decoded the machine + because her daughter’s silence is the lived cost of sanctioned forgetting + therefore she risks self-annihilation to break the cycle. Orientation is swift: saffron-veil historian, fractured archive dome, twilight, all within 50 words. No lens ambiguity; the entire plot is a because/therefore linkage between forbidden knowledge and irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s insertion reweights the shared dream rule-set, forcing tactile memory into cloud-soft fantasies. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each archival vignette thickens pattern until the final ripple reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the stone’s warmth and the flicker of wind-now-stings in a boy’s flight. Orientation is taught early (“blooming library above clouds” by line 2), so no penalty; transitions are seamless within the single dusk-spanning scene.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses the old sanctuary path, accepts slower regrowth, and the tail-tip compass crystallizes cost. Causal chain holds—ledger reveal → betrayal → tail ritual → new sanctuary plan—tightened once through pigment-mixing beat that reweights her mission. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural; image cadence, not plot twist, reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands: seed-merge is Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her former quest ends, new translation begins. Causal chain holds: ivy whispers → coffee ring confirms → tunnel opens by invitation → seed rewrites scar. Orientation anchored by 60 words; no penalty. One tightening beat suffices; lens stays situational-poetic throughout. Cost is legible in seed’s dissolution and hourglass release; no offstage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the marquee’s un-programmed epigraph—“LOVE NEVER ENDS — ONLY CHANGES FORM”—reweights every prior vault-of-love image with undeniable social cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density crests when the oilcloth bundle is revealed, then re-crystallizes in the rain-walk image. Causality is intact: because she incubates the film, therefore she finds the letters, therefore she chooses release, therefore the theater exhales. Cost is legible in the final line—lanterns ready to go out—so the ending lands on the page, not in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared on page (“stardust that clung…”) and held to the last cadence: each traced meteor tightens the weave until the final snap liberates the town’s voices. Orientation is swift—moon-gazer, cobblestone dawn, satchel—within 60 words. The closure unit is a Charged Poise: “tonight, creativity had slipped its cage,” a crystallized stance whose cost is undeniable in her spent curl beneath the arch. Persistent constraint—the need to keep tracing while her body fails—shapes every tactical choice and lands with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the second-hand trembles, re-weighting the frozen clock with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of "charm" pulses accumulates toward final image. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught early via freight guard, dune, post-forest-burns. However, no meaningful tightening or option foreclosure occurs; the mission succeeds without resistance or trade-off, keeping escalation static.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each metallic vignette layers sensory density until the void-music reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“tumbling through the canopy”), so no penalty. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the spinning gear and colorless light re-price the world—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, clipping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the child-shoe/rusty-whistle image reweights “unused courage” from loss to reserve. Causality is loose-lyric (Accumulative/Textural lens); the ridgeway walk accumulates perforations that leak star-light, tightening mood rather than options. No meaningful constraint or price is dramatized on-page for the guides themselves, so cost is conceptual, not felt. Orientation is lyrically delayed but ultimately serves closure, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single struck middle C shakes loose the fortress’s frozen heart and reweights every prior silence with audible cost. The bolt’s removal and return is the taught causal spine; the stain on the stair works as accumulative oracle, its color shift paying off in the final amber flush. Orientation is clean—fortress, snow, bellhop, and muteness are anchored within the first 120 words. The only restraint from 9+ is a hairline wish for a sharper because/therefore linkage between the child’s whistle threat and the exact moment he decides tonight is the night.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the font’s glow rewrites the realm’s blood-rule in a single image, cost paid by the collective shame we feel in the gallery gasp. Causal chain (ink → font → revelation) is tight; the rune-of-drift pattern is taught early and holds; orientation is anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity, no off-stage cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    The 17-second delay functions as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the reef’s slow-time existence rewrites her scientific paradigm and her life’s mission. Closure lands under Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-break (tapping ⇄ coral pulse) reweights stakes from loss to co-existence. Cost is felt when she pins the old atlas into a new, deeper cartography—she forfeits the authority of satellites for the humility of knuckle-listening. Lens holds without ambiguity; no因果 gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical shard layers density until the final chord reweights the stake from war to remembrance. Causal chain is interior but legible—because she listens, the stones answer; therefore the bay exhales and others converge. Closure is Charged Poise: options reconfigure under undeniable pressure, cost is the forfeiture of violent rebellion. Orientation is taught by line 3; no debt incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber dissolves into mist that seeds the land, reweighting destiny from singular artifact to distributed possibility. Causal linkage holds—glyph → chant → dissolution—each step narrows her option to possess, forcing renunciation with visible cost (her satchel now empty, joints creaking). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the final image crystallizes new meaning. No orientation or lens-ambiguity penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each return to the arboretum thickens texture until the found dew-drop reweights all prior grief. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pulse-carried pearl—whose conceptual cost (joy can be housed in ruin) is undeniable. Transitions are legible, pattern taught early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the inverted lighthouse, vertical sea, and reassembled box crystallize a new perceptual rule-set with undeniable cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of stitched fragments escalates until reality buckles. Orientation is taught early (“damp stone floor of the forgotten library inside a lighthouse”) and pays off when space itself folds. Causality remains internal but coherent: stitch → resonance → spatial inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “time slowed…to let you choose how you vanish” reweights the whole premise. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative lens—each ink vanishing foreshadows her own. Cost is legible in the final image: the silver ring glint then gone. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: because she catalogued → because letter hums heavier → therefore cracks wax → therefore Resonance Table floods networks → therefore regime reels. One scene, one POV, one transition (the off-stage city-wide cascade) taught early by “networks...still pulsed beneath society’s skin.” Closure is Charged Poise: she sits folded-hands while snow drifts, the city already altered; cost is the regime’s erasure of her name and liberty. No orientation debt—who/where/when anchored in first 40 words; persistent constraint (triple-ice quarantine) shapes final legend.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard (rose ritual, visitor encounter, child coda) layers density until the final image reweights “quiet” from absence to active presence. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven; the ballast scrap threads memory forward and the last seed-gift delivers conceptual repricing with undeniable social cost—continuity in ash. Orientation is secured by line 3 (“after the tower fell”) and the pattern is taught early. No meaningful escalation beyond deepening thematic stakes, but that is sufficient under the lyric contract; closure beat is the girl fingering dirt under her nails—cost felt without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spike cracks, echo migrates to constellations, garden settles—cost is the tool and the fisher’s monopoly on navigation lost. Causal linkage holds throughout: each silence-carved hollow directly enables the spike’s heating and the goddess-release. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sonic imagery tightens until pattern inverts sky/floor—final image reweights all prior vibration. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line three and paid off in the shrine orbit.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is clean: the emailed folio creates a Conceptual Repricing that collapses the official lie under its own impossibility, cost legible in the rooftop smoke now stitched to reckoning. Causal lens holds: every step (call → scope → timestamped photo → send) is a because/therefore sequence. The 2:17 a.m. burn-cycle tightens options; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Minor waiver: orientation anchor (who/where) is delayed until after 120 words, but the disorientation is deliberate and repaid by the inverted telescope image at closure, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the firmware’s weeping rewrites the rule-set—cries are no longer erased but translated into bearable grief, a social cost visible in the new constellation on her skin. The causal chain holds: amber placement → firmware stutter → glyph burn → lullaby completion → firmware weeps. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 100 words (lab, lost sounds, night). Cost is legible in the father’s final “Thank you” and the permanent tattoo that makes her body the new cradle. Persistent constraint: every future client will inherit this redeemed firmware’s softer static.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tile cracks, the hush crystallizes into “presence,” and she leaves the mandala to dissolve—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Causal chain holds: each fingertip swirl visibly alters the emergent voices, tightening options until silence re-weights meaning. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fractured tesserae → renamed lives. Orientation anchor (“ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky”) arrives inside 15 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blue shard becomes compass, mercy revalued from passive sigh to “steel that bends.” Cost is visible in the magistrate’s whispered loss and Elira’s bleeding palm. One causality micro-gap: the tessera’s supposed “key” power is asserted more than demonstrated before the magistrate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot coin’s sink into possibility re-weights the rule-set, germinating a silver sapling that continues the ghost’s work. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each echo-thread (woman, teen, old man) is braided by the seven-note lullaby, then rooted in lived futures. The image carries undeniable conceptual cost—the ghost’s extinction—rendered in oneiric logic rather than physical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chamber adds emotional density until the fossil’s dissolving reconfigures her solitude into shared signal. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks on “humming” with purpose re-priced—cost is the relic’s loss, felt in the image of motes vanishing into stone veins.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the jar finally “speaks,” gifting the reader a re-weighted premise that prophecy is fabric, not verdict, and the cost is the lifelong patience already spent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stanza-like paragraph adds density until the final cadence crystallizes meaning without reversing plot. Orientation is established early by sensory cues (warehouse, cliff, bench) and remains stable; no teleporting props or knowledge drift. The only slack is causality of the button-event: the ivory piece’s appearance “shudders” the jar, but the mechanics of that trigger are asserted, not seeded, so the beat feels ornamental rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weather image thickens the same moral texture. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—pillbox left to rust becomes on-page proof she abandons personal legacy for slow earth justice; felt cost is undeniable. One smooth, taught transition from climb to hatch. No orientation debt; “zephyr bluff” taught by line 1.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each sensory filament (fog breath, axle creak, gutter tick) layers density until rain-silence parts the veil, delivering a Charged Poise that reweights the reader’s sense of time and memory. The palimpsest promise is the pattern taught early and reprised in the needle transfer, so closure resonates without causal gimmicks. Cost is legible in the coachman’s continued solitude—he will ride again tomorrow—an earned stasis that forecloses rest. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no ambiguity persists.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers image upon image (smoke, wax, resin, clay) until the final soft pot + glowing glass crystallizes “time that chose to pause.” Orientation is secure by line 3; the tightening occurs when she decides not to fire the kiln—an Earned Stasis that visibly surrenders permanence, paying the conceptual cost of porous fragility. Causality is lyric rather than plotted, but the pattern is taught early and closure reweights the stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causality is clean: because she finds the tooth → she gauges barriers → she installs prisms → the neighborhood’s stance shifts. The 120-word orientation gate is met: fire escape, moonlit harbor, rose’s last petal all surface by line 4. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the city’s exhale and the child’s laugh make the conceptual cost—her perpetual vigilance, her brother’s absence—undeniable without exposition. One hairline slip: “tonight, though” is an external narrator nudge that momentarily leaks the pattern before it is fully taught.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens from the opening image of salt-crusted echoes and maintains it: pressure mounts through pattern intensification (tide → vapor-flood → gnomon blur) rather than causal reversals. Orientation is delivered lyrically yet lucidly inside 100 words (who: Veyra; where: tidal library above clouds; when: the brittle awakening of this dawn). Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the sundial’s shadow locks onto future genesis, reweighting the entire premise from archive to loom. The conceptual cost—she will midwife unknown hybrids instead of cataloguing ghosts—is unmistakable in the final metallic-tang image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each folded name increases density until the cadence shift of “Rejoin” reweights the stake from individual longing to communal circuitry, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost—Aris forfeits corporeal existence to become the temple’s pulse. Causality is internal yet coherent: the twig spiral’s arrival → packing → writing names → dissolution forms a because/therefore chain without external antagonist. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“lotus temple rose…”) and the pattern of dripping rainwater later pays off in the closure image, satisfying the disorientation waiver. No artifact obscures the final image; the last line braids solitude into belonging, fulfilling the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: because the tricksters piggyback on the station, therefore Elira must hijack the same carrier; because she threads counter-frequencies, the barricades fall. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Try me again. I’m listening” reweights the entire premise with undeniable future cost. Lens (Causal) holds start-to-finish; no orientation debt; no artifact near the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the “key” dissolves into her, spatial mutiny reframed as liberation, ceiling literally lifts—cost felt in the same breath. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of tightening space → sudden openness reweights stakes exactly once, no causal sleight-of-hand. Orientation anchor (“shadowed nexus under starlight”) appears by line 3, well inside 120-word guardrail. No teleporting props; compass, lantern, journal tracked throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the quarry breathes with suspended masks and shared grief, reweighting the premise that remembrance is the only justice possible. Causal linkage holds: ribbon → sketches → keeper’s tremor → joint unearthing. Cost is legible in the final image of two faceless figures guarding glass cases. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and deepened to last flicker.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: stanza discovered → typed → sky rewound, and the copper nail re-weights the ending with ancestral cost. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky’s golden crack and the quiet hum in her pocket crystallize exile reversed into pilgrimage. The “memory is grief” paragraph edges toward thematic echo but stops short of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its pattern of scaffold-flutter coordinates and pixelated-amnesty fragments, then reweights them in a luminous final image. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear within the first 60 words; no orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the floating shard reconfigures “never” into “space waiting to be sculpted”; the cost is the physical relinquishing of the glass flake and the emotional risk of stepping into disbelief, both legible on the page. The causal chain is light, but under the accumulative lens the cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circus-train think-tank reweights failure from shame to pedagogy, cost felt in the lantern-lit laughter that now haunts the yard. Accumulative lens holds: decay-to-renewal pattern tightens through each shard until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; who/where/when anchored by word 60. One causal micro-gap: CFO embezzlement is off-stage news, not dramatized, but it merely accelerates the inevitable spiral already signaled by glitching algorithms.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the act of singing redistributes rather than records sorrow, reversing the temple logic. Causal chain holds—telegram summons → charts aligned → lucid dream choice → song disperses burden—each because/therefore link tightening options until only communal absorption remains. The persistent constraint is explicit: she must keep writing poems “offered to variable stars,” a lifelong price legible on the last page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crown of thorns/petals fused to her brow makes the cost of revelation undeniable and reweights the entire rule-set of guarded identity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each frozen confession, petal, and root adds density until the cadence shift in the final paragraph crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“The druid stood at the edge of the cursed lake”). Persistent constraint: the seed’s roots remain inside her body, shaping future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: image-density coils tighter until the cobalt helix re-prices the covenant’s meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by second sentence; disorientation is functional and paid off in final merge. Closure is a Charged Poise: the ground exhales, light spirals, options rewire without exposition. Cost is legible in the instant her roots lock—body as final currency.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s collaborative surfacing of cards reweights the premise, cost felt in Kael’s loosened grip and the visible constraint of living manacles. Causal linkage holds: because Elira inlays meaning, the orchard answers; because Kael attacks, the roots restrain; therefore their stances crystallize. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“catacomb orchard breathed”). No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of rust, echo, and cloth threads mounts until the pattern breaks with the laptop beat. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—speaker cloth pinned beside blueprints reweights the whole cataloguing system; the quarry’s literal echo now promises music, not silence. Cost is undeniable: the safety of emotional insulation is foregone. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors land by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the seedling writes an untranslatable glyph in air, reconfiguring meaning while Elira bows, paying the cost of permanent incomprehension. Causal linkage holds—each cuneiform gesture tightens magnetic resonance until the seed splits; no teleporting props. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation (no wind yet branches sway) is taught in sentence 1 and pays off in the final image of language becoming living arbor. Accumulation cap does not apply; closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final “silver hush” reweights the premise—wonder migrates, never dies—while the atrium’s sigh makes the cost of endless archiving felt. Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical shard adds density until the creel’s pulse becomes the atrium’s heartbeat; no causal gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“tidal atrium”) and the moon-phase rule is taught early via the spectacles. Persistent constraint: her waxing/waning selfhood shapes every tactical move (when to shelve, when to kneel). Cost is unmistakable in the final image—she walks on, knowing tomorrow will again dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught early and held: each confession layers refractive light until the cave itself becomes translucent, delivering a Charged Poise closure with undeniable conceptual cost—she is now the living medium of others’ abandoned hopes. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no teleporting props. The shell’s emptying and pearl’s disappearance are the exact on-page images that re-weight the premise, satisfying cost-proof test. Persistent constraint: once crowned, she cannot return to private isolation; the glow she now carries is the price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each graffito, ivy tendril, wheeze reweights the guilt map. Closure is a Charged Poise—accordion chord fading, station “shifted to make space”—felt cost is undeniable. Pattern taught by 25% (Point Zero sink) and coherence maintained through final image. Persistent constraint: taped bellows constrains every song to imperfect timbre.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    The recursive, accumulative design is declared early (“cyclically reversed nature of the stacks”) and pays off in the cracked-mirror Resonant Reconfiguration: every prior seeker is folded into the same loop, making the protagonist both cause and effect. Propagation delays are not technobabble—they visibly rewrite the shelves behind her, so the closure image re-prices the entire journey with conceptual cost. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each glyph she carves literally alters the archive’s past, tightening the spiral. The mirror’s reflection is the unmistakable on-page moment where cost becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly via Conceptual Repricing: the empire’s legitimacy melts into literal seeds that rewrite the observatory floor—undeniable social cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: plant chorus, violin facets, and Chancellor’s reflection accrete until the pattern ruptures. Orientation is swift; velvet observatory + midsummer + barefoot agent all appear in first 90 words. Micro-turn is the ice-to-seed phase shift that reweights stakes, foreclosing authentication as a viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the chip now glows with the scholar’s terminal lucidity, and the mortician’s future self-sacrifice is forecast, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-elliptical yet coherent—each “infuse” beat layers density until silence itself hesitates. The grotto, aurora, and chip are anchored by word 50; no orientation debt. The persistent price (she will lie on the same floor and surrender) shapes tactics and final image; lens = Accumulative/Textural, held without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hairpin’s re-insertion reconfigures meaning and forecloses vengeance without a spoken word; the cost is the permanent acceptance of a scar. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (mist, petrichor, silver glint) deepens the stake until the final image resonates. Orientation is taught by line 3; no ambiguity at exit. No causal break or convenience plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because the shard speaks → she climbs; because the chimes command → she unhooks; because the cloak falls → she sees uncertain self. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the seashell’s iridescence reweights the entire premise—certainty is no longer the product she sells. Cost is visible in the pooled velvet shadow she abandons.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: stone-to-ripples pattern teaches delay early, reweights at starlit symbol reveal. Closure = Conceptual Repricing: “vanishing isn’t erasure—it’s preparation” re-prices both characters’ fates with felt cost (Elira’s exile from linear time). Orientation anchored by word 80; no ambiguity. One causal micro-turn: Kael’s gaze shift from waves to time-glyphs narrows option space.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of dust/bone/crow layers tightens until the pulse nests in the ribcage, reweighting meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image—“let the world move around it”—crystallizes options and registers cost without physical act. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but taught by 25 % and payoff at closure; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: keystone pulse → mist path → cloud-tree → keystone left as gift → Lior retooled. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: he forfeits institutional greatness for micro-charms, a visible forfeiture signaled by “its warmth lived in his palms now.” Cost is legible in the final image of him “glowing when someone felt alone”—a staked life-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: ledger + key reweight his life purpose, cost is the solitude visibly accepted in the last line. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lantern drift, barnacle chandeliers, cerulean-amber note accrete until a single perceptual shift re-tunes reality. Causality intact: key → dive → ledger → recognition → renunciation; no teleporting props. Orientation clear by line 14 (pier, midnight, woman’s hand-off). No −0.3 cap needed. The one tightening beat—seeing his pre-birth vow—forces the final stance; no outline-and-then sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin-toss celebrates a path already chosen, reweighting every prior surrender. Accumulative lens holds—each coin, static burst, and backwards prophecy thickens the pattern until the final cadence shifts from randomness to resonance. Persistent constraint: the dying amber star remains, ensuring cost survives the epiphany. No causal breaks or orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: naming the beasts crystallizes grief into beacons, reconfiguring his eternal task with undeniable conceptual cost—"so others might carry less weight." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each naming adds density until the atlas itself glows. Causality is internal but causal nonetheless—because he listens, because he names, the fear is repurposed. Cost is legible in the final line: he is no longer heartbroken but condemned to carry, a stasis that forecloses return to prior detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s silent fall reweights the cosmic ledger, signaled by the single fish’s breach—undeniable,低成本, yet world-altering. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each droplet beat adds density until the pattern crystallizes in the resin seam; coincidence (first fish) complicates, not resolves. Causality is intact—no knowledge or prop teleporting—and the Orientation Test is satisfied inside 120 words. Persistent constraint: the bell, once dropped, is unrecoverable, shaping the final image of barefoot departure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first silent chime to final unsounded chime: each surfaced relic adds density until the meaning of “expunge” is inverted without a causal twist. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the state’s own bureaucratic language is reclaimed as memorial, a resonant reconfiguration that lets the drowned town keep speaking. Orientation anchors (who=warden, where=ridgeway, when=twilight) land by line 4; no orientation debt. Cost is felt in the supervisor’s frown and Elias’s permanent reassignment—an on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crystal’s vanishing reweights her rule-set—wonder is not gold but catalyst. Causal linkage holds: starling pattern → flame response → crystal sublimation, each because/therefore beat tightening the stake. Cost is legible in the final image—“flameless but alight”—a persistent constraint on future practice. Orientation, lens, and escalation cohere without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single chime reframes the entire arbor network’s stance toward silence, re-pricing “quiet” from threat to covenant. Because/therefore chain holds: static clears → silence felt as signal → buckle chime → arbor glow answer → she re-clips → walks toward next quiet. The cost is legible in the re-clips click—she now carries the added weight of every future revision. No orientation debt; world rules (sideways trees, sky-whales) are taught through her attention filter within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the duplicate steps free, Kael’s numbness cracks, and the custody question dissolves because identity itself is re-priced. Cost is legible in the final image—“the quiet glow of presence, of love without claim.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the humming dojo, fractal synapses, and rewriting histories tighten the emotional stake pattern until the gold flare crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are vivid within first 120 words. Single causal micro-turn: surrendering ownership forecloses the path of self-repossession.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    The seed’s arrival → planting → room design → sideways sprout → posthumous journal forms a clean causal chain under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat adds density to the myth rather than chasing external plot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “The seed was never meant to flower” reweights every prior puzzle and obsession, revealing the cost is lifelong dedication to potential, not actual bloom. One过渡性微转：the shoot grows sideways—an on-page reversal that bends gravity in the next room, tightening options without breaking causality. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook”) and held; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tunnel’s tiny answering laugh reconfigures meaning without resurrecting the child, cost felt in the perpetual return to absence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical fragment layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift—tunnel, dusk, alone by line 3. No causal break; the echo’s gift is not a solution but a stasis he chooses to endure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pendant’s transfer reweights “boundaries of light” from walls to membranes, with felt cost—the guardian’s solitude is literally handed off. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each swallowed landscape and licked statue accretes until the garden exhales a shared silence. Orientation is taught immediately via frost-laced boughs and silver hum; no debt incurred. Final line “almost like a smile” crystallizes Charged Poise—uncertainty is now communal lantern, not private wound.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the crozier’s serpent head lifts—alive but unfinished—and Elric steps into a portable twilight, renouncing the hope-outcome in favor of motion. Causal chain holds: iterate-fail-adapt is dramatized beat-by-beat (moonstone circle → blood drop → frost bloom → void-eyes). The non-closure accumulation cap stays untouched—no teleporting props, no retro-patches. Felt cost is pinpoint: “burden and benediction” in the last line; the −0.1 reflects the Orientation Test waiver earned because late disorientation (indigo syrup) is paid off in the resonant thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the towers awaken, the fragment sacrificed, her path foreclosed—cost is the lost artifact and perpetual exile from proof. Causal linkage holds: lunar perigee → coil tuning → fragment resonance → city revival, each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. One of the rare 600-word pieces where the final image reweights the whole premise with conceptual cost visible in the dissolve of “oxidized chrome” into sky.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is thin but legible: disappearances → radio tuning → merged ferries. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—permanence renounced, transience embraced—felt cost is the deckhand’s eternal vigil. Mosaic shards (deck, grotto, deck again) are taught by salt-spray refrain; transitions clear, lens stable.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the thread’s release re-stitches the gallery into a new possible space, cost felt in the “older, quieter” mirror-self. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stitching intensifies until environment ruptures and reweighs meaning. Causality intact: each memory-woven stitch thickens the thread and provokes gallery resistance. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the anchor silhouette over starfield reconfigures meaning—chain rigidity becomes navigable flexibility—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality is intact, yet the cost is conceptual (human identity shift) rather than a tangible loss felt by Elira herself, so the beat stops just short of the sharper personal price the 9+ gate prefers.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: each object—photograph, hearing aid, mist—layers emotional density until the mist thins and the pulse calms. The arrival of the living girl is the single deepening that reweights the stake from “trace” to “release.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: tracer and child walk toward glowing exit, the photograph now calm, its frequency shifted. Cost is legible in the tracer’s soaked knees and the girl’s first footstep forward.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she emerges carrying “open sky within her,” a charged poise that reweights the underground ordeal and the grandfather’s quest. The gold fleck’s crumbling into “dust that smelled of incense and ozone” is the exact on-page image where cost becomes undeniable under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: every descent step is “because” the tide is out; the final seal “therefore” follows from her inserting the spent fleck. No teleporting props; the laminated drawing re-appears glowing at the end, paying off its setup.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ink mandala crystallizes the ghost-data into pattern, Aris presses shard to palm—cost is visible, conceptual, irreversible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: dendritic ink, frost fractals, heartbeat accrual tighten the stake to “honor residue.” Causality holds: every beat of attention widens the hollow the state dug, then fills it with vigilance. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and the pattern pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon’s forward-echo of her final word re-prices silence itself, with conceptual cost unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of echo, pattern of flock, texture of tongue—tightening once when the diamond’s vacuum distills pure signal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at closure, so no penalty. No causal turns are required; the cadence shift from hush to living syntax satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered phone, vanished arrowhead, and new skin-map re-weight gravity and grief with undeniable cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The mossy greenhouse anchors who/where by word 50; causality holds because each bioluminescent pulse foreshadows the final auroral dissolve. No orientation or lens debt. Persistent constraint: the glyph-tattoo forecloses return to ordinary physics, shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s pulse under her feet reconfigures stakes without tidy victory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each resonantly soft phrase adds density until stone softens and saplings sprout. Persistent constraint—aching arm, spent shell—shapes every late tactic. No orientation debt; sky-bridge, orchard, statues anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: because the drone lattice hunts heat/EM spikes → therefore a bottled storm is needed → therefore Marla rigs the arcade grid → therefore the drone can slip through. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky itself becomes the letter, rewriting “broken promises” into a flying message whose cost (stolen storm, lighter satchel, heavier chest) is legible in the final image. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—illegal weather signature—shapes every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (mist, dust, halo glow, wind-bell chime) thickens the hush until the carousel’s resurrection reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the halo-crowned carousel turns in silence—whose conceptual cost (he will remain forever voice-outside-the-world) is unmistakable. Orientation is secured by line 3; the clown-signpost misstep is the causal pivot that teaches the pattern. No loops or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the amphitheater reveal re-weights every prior shelf and orb as living, not archived, and the cost is the librarian’s irreversible integration into that field—she exits humming, visibly altered, scarf now resonant. Causal chain holds: scarf → scroll → axiom → fold → amphitheater → reawakening, each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4. The only hairline slip is the off-page grandmother rule-dump, but it is paid back immediately in the activation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the palette closes “not to store, but to savor,” crystallizing that longing must remain open-ended even when its object returns. Causal chain holds—each pigment is tied to a prior loss, so the final mixture’s glow is payable only with lived grief. Orientation is swift: archipelago, stilted libraries, pre-dawn ferry silence all within 60 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; escalation is a density of light-captures that re-weights the stake until the single chromatic application releases the apparition with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon on his wrist and the glowing idea against his chest visibly reweight the rule-set—love spoken unarmored is no longer lockable. Causal chain holds: hair-lock → door recognition → ribbon self-binding → idea freed, each step because/therefore. Cost is unmistakable in the stardust-blooded palms and the sealed door’s sigh. The lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the smile–soil gesture crystallizes her choice to feed the orchard with the rest of her memories, cost felt in the scent of peach and pipe smoke that now will be swallowed. Causal lens holds throughout—each star-map, log entry, and the final trawler deviation act as because/therefore triggers that narrow options toward this last fork. The price is on-page and irreversible; no ambiguity at the lens. Meets 9+ gate with constraint (she can no longer leave) shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shadow stays caged, her exile remains reversible, cartographer redraws with firmer hand—felt cost is the continuing burden of fracture. Causal chain holds: tea-leaf misread → void threat → precise annotation → novice shift → containment confirmed. Orientation granted in first 40 words; no seams. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens possibility or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed’s glow answers dawn, reweighting all prior filaments of memory into an anchored future. Causality holds—each distilled memory tightens the weave until the crack of the shell is inevitable. Cost is visible in the sealed seam; she can never cross back.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each knot’s release layers spectral density until the blackened knot detonates, reweighting the stakes; the final sanctuary sigh reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is intact, escalation is legible, closure lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: shadow-shifts accrue across reels until the spiral pattern reweights the stake—silence as vessel, not void. Closure is a Charged Poise: the projected chapel silhouette, pooled in dusk, reconfigures meaning without rebuilding stone; the tear in the map becomes an invitation, paid for by years of solitary frame-work. Cost is legible in the final image—“she packed her gear with shielded openness”—a bodily acknowledgment that the witness will carry the hush outward. No causality break; ellipsis is motivated, pattern taught early, payoff on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing conveyed by the vanished-yet-transferred snow globe: the physics rule-set is rewritten—mass converts to light—at perceptible cost (hollow/humming body, warm wind). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern fragments (counterclockwise vortex, upward flakes, temperature dips) accrue into the final image where the storm unthreads and the object unselves. Orientation is immediate—trench, lab, cliff—without disorientation; every shard teaches the lyric pattern by 25 % mark. Cost is legible in the final beat: the lighthouse beam becomes “a single thread of silver” that snaps, leaving the narrator hollow and the world warmer—undeniable stake payment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “You encoded longing. I decoded love” reweights every prior spray-stroke with undeniable social cost—she is no longer singing into voids but into a shared syntax. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of chromatic glyphs and server-hum crests until the gold final bridge; the courtyard’s fog itself becomes a legible before/after. Orientation is taught lyrically rather than literal-anchored—acceptable because the disorientation of “above clouds” pays off as the gravity-optional hush that lets the bolt-plate communion happen. Persistent constraint is present: the bolt plate’s obsolete grooves literally shape the cipher that makes the connection possible.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked goggles refract the world into “fractured beauty,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each floor adds density until the diary’s final line crystallizes acceptance. Orientation is swift; the elevator window anchors who/where by line four. No causal break; the cipher’s reveal is coincidence, but coincidence is allowed to complicate under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud entry layers density until the final dissolution reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she smiles because the sky has accepted her ledger, not because pain vanishes; the cost is the ongoing silence she will keep descending into. Causality is internal but legible: the act of naming becomes the because/therefore that lets her stay aloft. No orientation debt; pattern taught by word 50.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn whine + closed eyes + smile crystallize options—she has translated cosmos into touch and forfeited external witness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each groove-to-star brushstroke intensifies texture until final silence reweights stakes. “She didn’t need witnesses” is the conceptual cost that revalues her life’s work. Persistent constraint—demolition clock—shapes every tactical acceleration; cost is felt in final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the chalk hopscotch reweights the world’s blank spaces. Causality links each beat: dog-ear proverb → chalk observation → starling response → luminance beacon; no teleporting info. Cost is legible in the final blank dog-ear he now must fill. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: she leaves “empty-handed but full-hearted,” a credible RR. Yet causality is loose: the prophecy scraps appear once and never constrain tactics; mirrors supply memory montage but no because/therefore turn. The eclipse-forged keys arrive as fait-accompli, so the decisive breach—touching the constellation—lacks a prior test that failure could have met.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula appears only when unity is achieved, reweighting prior chalk-and-bell set-ups with conceptual cost—the orchard they leave behind. Causality is accumulative/textural; each chalk message and the bell-ringing deepen density until the pattern crystallizes. No teleporting props; bell and nebula are consistently tethered. The lens holds cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe is not saved but tucked in, a visible reframing of apocalypse as lullaby. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via nested lullaby patterns until the final hush reweights all stakes. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“hidden lighthouse at dusk”) and pays off when the beacon turns inward; no debt incurred. Cost is unmistakable in the dissolve of glass, stone, sea—matter itself forfeited for tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard’s frost feathers the branches as the caretaker’s invisible path system re-weights the curse’s rules—he can still walk back, but without the mnemonic nut, tomorrow’s navigation is already costlier. Causal lattice holds throughout: because he deciphers the nut, therefore he can leave subliminal trails; because he surrenders it, the chorus of ghosts is stopped but his own silence deepens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by the second paragraph; the labyrinth’s spatial logic remains coherent as trails are laid and read. No late-rule patches; every mechanical bird and shale scrape is set up and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: foam patterns, chrysalis, braided streams accrue meaning until the “phase-change” Conceptual Repricing lands. Orientation anchored by ~120 words (ravine, gloves off, chrysalis). Closure is clean: she decides to design a dissolving scaffold, humming—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. One minor causality fuzz: hospital scaffold failure is recounted, not dramatized, but river epiphany retroactively powers it. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open ledger and seven ceiling-dancing glimmers reconfigure meaning—the vendor’s emptiness is now externalized inventory, cost legible. Accumulative lens holds: each sale adds density until the counter’s gleaming lattice crystallizes the stakes. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“glass orchard library floating…”) and pays off in the final orchard-labyrinth exit. No causality break; the incise ritual foreshadows the culminating mark.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern of “emotional sediment” in the first 120 words and never breaks it. The descent staircase and coral pavilion form a visible tightening spiral; each tactile contact increases density until the final mist-release reweights the premise. Closure—petrichor on her tongue, fortress humming with release—lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: she forfeits self to become a crucible for communal sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valley’s meaning is rewired from “tomb of surplus” to “cathedral of communal trust,” with the cuckoo weight left as visible price. Causal chain is loose—linguistic layering persuades metal rather than forces it—but the accumulative/textural pattern is taught early and charges the final harmonic chime. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. The elevator’s speaking agency is an unexplained rule change, yet it is accepted as lyric premise rather than late convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: each kneel, palm-press, and angled reflection triggers the next micro-revelation, tightening options until the mirror’s new constellation forecloses pure mourning. Orientation is swift—canyon, moon, shale by line 3. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cracked glass becomes a lens for inner cartography, the price being perpetual excavation of other people’s pain. Cost is legible in the final pulse against her ribs—she now carries payable grief as instrumentation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is legible: inverted gravity → thresholds open → sigil guides → chamber yields Seed. Orientation anchors (who/where) appear by line 3; no penalty. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: world re-rights, chamber seals, Seed now whispering—conceptual cost legible. Yet tightening is single-turn; no option narrows before the wall peels apart, so escalation feels foregone rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: silence → found object → crack-analysis → carved resonance chamber → grove re-awakens; each step tightens options toward the final hum. The insulator’s “stress-rungs as score” is a taught pattern that pays off when fractures become literal frets of sound, delivering conceptual cost: brokenness = voice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical recursions (twilight, dent, hum) tighten affect rather than causal chain. Closure is a Charged Poise: the nexus flares, covenant wakes, tutor turns away—cost is conceptual but undeniable. Orientation anchor arrives ~80 words—safe. Minor slip: “correlate” mechanics are asserted not shown, softening the final reconfiguration a hair beneath 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: pacifism → frequency tuning → clasp surrender; each attempt therefore narrows sonic options until the diary yields. Closure (Charged Poise) lands when she matches her own breath to the residual hum, crystallizing empathy as perpetual labor under exploding sky. Fireworks’ conceptual cost—world’s noise will keep coming—reweights her earlier “recovery” into an endless duty. No orientation drift; who/where anchored by line 3, when by “final stillness before fireworks.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as earned Conceptual Repricing: the wilted flower reweights the village’s emotional rule-set, cost legible in the collective apology and “softer steps.” Causal chain holds—seed dormancy → collective doubt crests → bloom → societal shift—each because/therefore link tightens options. Orientation anchored by line 30; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the “tide’s thought” turn is declared more than dramatized, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the planet-wide chord reweights her mission from management to echo, with the arrow fused to the trunk as permanent, costly marker. Causality holds: dew-spiral navigation → arrow → accelerated bloom → planetary song, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late (~130 words) but the lyric delay pays off in the final sonic image, satisfying the waiver condition. The cost is legible—the orchard will never be harvested—and the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: each wind reading thickens the pattern until the maze itself feels predatory; closure is a Charged Poise—the investigator plants himself as living sensor, reconfiguring the stake from “map the wind” to “become its student at personal peril.” Causal glue holds: every measurement foreshadows the final gambit, no off-stage cheats. Cost is unmistakable in the final line: “Let it learn me too” — he forfeits immunity, stakes body and cognition. Minor Orientation Test waiver: who/where are delayed until ~140 words, but the disorientation is functional—mirrors the investigator’s own disquiet—and pays off in the climactic reveal that the maze teaches the wind, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chromatic strike layers density until the hush itself is re-sculpted, delivering a legitimate CR at the end (“wonder certified as oxygen”). Orientation is crisp by line 3; transitions are unnecessary in the single scene. The only causal slack is that the amber sheet melts without prior causal seeding, a minor teleporting prop.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: “Some doors stay open by staying closed” reweights the entire weave premise with undeniable social/conceptual cost. The accumulative pattern—catalogued failures, driftwood markers, breath-echo—builds to the final refusal; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds without contradiction. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (range name, keeper kneeling, post-guardianship timeframe). Persistent constraint: the spent flute remains in situ, surrendering its gold, a visceral price that continues to shape pilgrim offerings.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each pamphlet and halo-use adds density until the final glyph collapses meaning. Orientation is swift—workshop, star-death deadline, and nameless operator arrive by line 3. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last star sighs, the fragment dims, she walks into dark; the cosmos-scale cost is felt. One causal gap: how pamphlets “find” recipients is unestablished, but the pattern teaches it as part of the mythic logic, so the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant’s release reconfigures meaning and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but the cost is atmospheric rather than concrete; the beat is beautiful yet slightly weightless because no prior tactic is visibly constrained by the pendant’s loss.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity” re-weights the premise and carries undeniable conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density rises as frost melts and prism warms—held without contradiction. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“quartz arbor”), well inside the 120-word allowance. The final image of rainbowed salt-tasting light is the persistent constraint that will shape every future morning she wakes to it.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty chair and hovering bead make the cost of her disappearance legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each shuttle pass literally dissolves her—so the final image reweights the premise without exposition. The puzzle-box arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational pressure rules. Orientation is anchored early by loom, orchard, and vanished courier; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each silk-thread gift tightens the pattern until the last length charges the wall glyph—closure is a Charged Poise where magic returns to world, not object. Causality holds: silk diminishes → community strengthens → glyph locks → Arlo becomes conduit. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by word 40. Cost is felt: “He didn’t need the silk anymore” = conceptual repricing with personal forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the green shard cools, the bay re-crumples, and Elira’s responsibility is felt without exposition. Causality is coherent under a lyrical-accumulative lens; each sensory beat thickens the texture until the crystalline core’s weight re-prices her existence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 120 words and recur through sensory cues, satisfying the single-scene window. Only hairline slip: “cyclically spontaneous flickers” is named twice but never given micro-cause; yet this does not touch the final image, so no deduction reaches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-lit lantern and louder hum reweight Elias’s stoic ritual into an audible beacon whose cost—perpetual solitude—is felt without exposition. Causal chain holds: wife-loss motivates silence → silence drives anonymous-letter ferrying → lamp snuff prompts sea-glass placement → stone cairn externalizes endurance → lamp revival ratifies the act. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—grief’s mute vow—shapes every tactical choice and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the inverted-shadow flare reweights the world’s future with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/textural lens holds—pattern of nightly ritual tightens through sensory recursion—though the piece teaches its mosaic rhythm late (~40 %), warranting a small orientation waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the fabric that “responded to gaze… like a heartbeat caught mid-sigh” crystallizes her new ethic of authentic fracture under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven—each sunrise observation thickens pattern until the tilt of light reweights meaning; no orientation debt. The cost is felt in the patrons’ wordless tears and her own silence—an earned stasis that forecloses the old quest for imitation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she renounces repair and instead “remembers for them,” mapping sorrow onto rings she now vows never to cut. Causal chain intact—moonlit healing enables dream projection → compels her stance crystallization with felt cost (forests now own her labor, she owns their grief). Orientation anchored by line 3 (stormlit tower, moonlight, labyrinth worker). One minor scaffold: “not with tools, but with patience” echoes next sentence’s “not with heat, but with resonance,” but cadence serves lyric pattern and does not obscure cause.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mica cracks release communal dawn and the keeper’s identity re-weaves from curator to loom, cost paid in her tears and the irreversible dispersal of hoarded light. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added voice tightens the pattern until the greenhouse itself “breathed deeper.” Orientation is swift: mirror-world, night-bound greenhouse, star-moss underfoot within the first 100 words. No causal reversals are needed; the escalating density of song-stitch fulfills the contract. A hairline slip: the child’s first off-key echo arrives with mild convenience, but it is seeded by the keeper’s invitation, so causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early (dust, paradox shelf, self-addressed invitation) and lets density tighten until the final Charged Poise: books realign, invitation is re-pinned, Elira reads aloud from the ladder. Causal linkage is lyric rather than plot-engine: because she re-reads her own accusation, therefore she re-weights empathy as sanctuary. Orientation is anchored by word 60. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—she becomes the paradox she once shelved. Persistent constraint: the library’s rule that truth creaks floorboards is obeyed when her whispered name shifts the shelves.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the uncloaking + guerrilla gardening reweight the courtyard from relic to living altar, cost felt in her exposed skin and the bread left to rot. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seeded crack and sensory layer deepens the dominant stake—reclaiming sacredness—until the final drip and star confirm the shift. Orientation is taught lyrically early (“after the birds fly south”) and anchors spatially by line three; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the vanished bakery’s absence (no bread replenishment) silently shapes her offering’s finality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the slide dims, the capsule seals, the library “exhales,” re-weighting oblivion vs memory with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—every lyrical repetition (“luminous vow,” “quartz hush”) tightens the cadence until the final shaft of twilight re-prices the stake. One causal micro-turn ( violet “I forgive you” re-calibrates the Array) is sufficient at this length and lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each feint (disguise failures, knee-drop, fob touch) narrows options until the single touch ruptures the deal. Orientation (who/where/when) locked by line 5; no teleporting props. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—trust audibly breaks in Marla’s exhale and Chain’s boot click, costing both parties the alliance and the girl her anonymity; the cost is on the page and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ring points down, storm absorbed, and she steps into dawn with surrendered doubt. Causal chain holds—each taste shift forces a spatial move that leads to convergence. Orientation—who, where, when—anchored within first 80 words. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, but legible in the forest’s greening and her pocketed ring.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the lock snaps, charcoal reclaimed, portraits freed—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her stance from caged to sovereign. Causality is lyrical but intact: the cave’s resonance answers her internal pressure, not magic. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation (no lantern, glowing walls) pays off in the final warm dawn glow.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens: each found note tightens the stake of “ candor in small moments” via density increase; closure is Charged Poise—she steps back into “ emerald haze” now reweighted as living archive. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (“humid gloom of the greenhouse city”). No lens ambiguity; the humming plate teaches the pattern early. Cost is felt in the final image: toxic sky still presses, but she carries the letters—conceptual price unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tuning → glisten → resonance deepens until the iceberg fragment’s final cobalt pulse reweights wonder after her death. Closure is Charged Poise: wind and weather become new conductors, the sculpture’s ongoing hum proving preservation succeeds beyond her body. Cost is legible in “she simply stopped climbing,” leaving the work to impersonal forces.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the empty box beside the caretaker reweights the entire premise—preservation was never the goal, only transmutation—charging the final image of petals drifting from its ribs with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: magnetic north’s shift and the burn are pattern breaks that reweight the stake from survival to harmonized song; the cost is visible in the biomechanical fusion of glass veins and metal.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the mailbox exhales and Leo’s weep converts the locket’s grief from private echo to communal witness, reweighting Elara’s rule-set—objects leave when their story is heard. Causal chain is slim (“hum therefore door opens”) but acceptable under Situational lens because the emotional pressure is coherent and the cost (Leo’s tear-streaked laughter) is on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stanza-layer thickens the pattern until the closing encryption collapse. Closure is a Charged Poise—she vanishes into her own cipher—cost is the forfeited escape capsule she chooses not to board. Orientation is taught by image-first disorientation that pays off. Minor slip: the “three steps forward, one back” maternal rule is told once without later dramatized echo—cost still legible, but hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the aster-glowing doorway reconfigures both reality and meaning, with conceptual cost paid by the whale-bone glow outside the pocket. Causality is lyric-Accumulative—each wildflower added, each spiral in coffee grounds, each salt crack intensifies texture until the threshold opens; no gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“dawn…beached whale”) and never drifts. The lens holds from first anomaly to final suspended tear.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of hush, flow, and paper-light re-weights the stake from “avert doom” to “become listener.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the crane’s spiral carries the prophecy upward while the summoner’s stance crystallizes into nightly vigil; the cost is the open-ended surrender of solitude. Orientation is swift (moonlit brook by line 3), causality is lyric but coherent; one causal hairline slip—how mapping silence physically unravels code—keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the key sliding across the bench crystallizes a new reciprocal contract—she can now “write back” to the building—priced by the immediate forfeiture of every previous lie. Causality is lyric but traceable: each sugar/tea swap accretes data until the archivist must reciprocate with the key, a because/therefore linkage held under an Accumulative lens. The meteor’s “unfinished thought” reweights the prior scar-image, making the cost atmospheric, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vow “I archive you” crystallizes stance and forecloses retrieval, with the shell’s silence as undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt breeze, fading star) tightens the same stake—translate or lose—until the final harmonic surge reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“velvet garden at twilight”); no teleporting props. Persistent constraint: the shell must be released to complete the archive, shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the scroll exhales, the bud opens, the kingdom wakes—cost is the lifetime of exile now irreversible. Causal chain holds: comet-key → vault → ink mixed with tear-and-blood → altered clause → aurora flares; each because/therefore link tightens until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. The resonance persists after the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the entity reduced to “a sigh” and the shell silenced visibly cost her raw throat and lighter soul; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lyrical disclosure thickens resonance until the cadence shift at dawn reweights stakes. Causal links are present (shell→revelations→song→entity shrinks) but the primary drive is accretive pattern, cleanly taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dream shard layers density until the globe’s placement in the ice-window crystallizes a Charged Poise that reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—strangers’ dreams will fade, the echo now irreversibly housed in glacier. Anchor who/where/when is taught by line 3; the 120-word test is met without penalty. The closure beat (“a sigh…not wind, not voice, but release”) lands the RR with cost, satisfying 9+ quick test, but the causal chain between dream-cataloguing and the sigh is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain, moon paths, firefly pulses) thickens the stake of “seeing the unseen.” Closure is a Charged Poise—whisk aloft, fireflies syncing—where cost is felt as eternal anonymity. Orientation is clear by line 8; causality is internal but coherent. No tightening turn escalates risk; the piece deepens instead, satisfying the 8.8 gate for lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each image-layer (glowing petals, growth rings aligned to storms, diamond pulsing) adds density until the final moment reweights the whole pattern—radiation-as-nourishment becomes a lived conceptual repricing. Closure is the charged poise of her stepping beyond the orchard while the stillpoint hums inside her ribs; the cost is the sorrow she names for every buried orchard, a conceptual loss made legible in the final paragraph. Causality is associative, not sequential, but the pattern is taught by line 4 and held without lapse. No orientation debt; who-where-when lands by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cobalt broadcast crystallizes a new option (“invitation”) with undeniable social cost—Kael’s sterile dawn is now contested. Causal chain holds: every lyric fragment she decodes → vellum archive → harmonic lattice trigger. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught within 60 words; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: ice-song → key awakens → Heartstone threat → sonic counter-song; the lock-in-a-hairline seam is a crisp Decisive Change that visibly costs her stamina and reconfigures her role. Closure is earned, on-page, and pays off the lighthouse-crystal premise without explanatory filler.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the mapper kneeling on thawing ice, mapping change itself, crystallizes options and reweights the revolution from event to atmosphere; cost is felt in her refusal to seize overt victory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density of lunar repetitions, cadence shift from industrial clang to hush—culminating in the resonant reconfiguration of silence as power. Orientation is clear within 60 words; no causality breaks, no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (moon’s cadence) shapes every tactic and the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s pulse-synced heartbeat reconfigures her stance toward the next tunnel while the city’s denial remains intact—cost is felt in the etched names and the still-glowing iron she walks away from. Causal chain holds: lantern summons memory → reveals 1852 rupture → worker’s electrocution reframed → she anchors lantern → reverberations soften. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each failed gear trial therefore narrows his options until the single sunlight beam re-visions the escapement, forcing the decisive realignment. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he remains kneeling in silence, but grace is re-priced as an ongoing, mechanical pulse he must live with rather than a verdict he can achieve. Cost is palpable: years of preached forgiveness now apply to him, the box’s audible tick externalizing that debt. Orientation anchors within first 60 words; no ambiguity, no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s “metallic sigh” reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—she’s earned the right to wake the next world. Causal chain (arrow → algorithm → bell) is tight; kaleidoscope mechanics are taught early and paid off. One transition (glider → workshop) is legible; orientation anchors by line 5. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: at 07:07 she floods the substrate with resonance, avatars flicker, and she accepts lifelong haunting—cost is the perpetual “warmth of a drive that shouldn’t be spinning.” Accumulative lens holds throughout; each 0707 breadcrumb thickens textual density until the pattern combusts into silhouettes. Causality is lyric-not-linear, but every beat obeys the rule that deletion ≠ erasure, so the final stutter of her cursor feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the oval mirror returns her childhood self, reframing the shard from war relic to lens of mercy; cost is legible in the shard’s warmth and the open ice channels. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of glimpses builds density until the final reprise. Orientation is clean (lighthouse orchard, frost, night) by line 4. No causal breaks; the “weighted breath” functions as taught pattern, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of listening beats thickens until the parasol’s “wet chime” crystallizes the glacier’s collapse; cost is palpable when marina vanishes. Closure is a Charged Poise—she drifts, “full,” the parasol tip vibrating with memory—threshold reweighted, path foreclosed. Orientation anchored by line 4; transitions legible within single shard. No meaningful escalation break; tightening is the synchronized hush itself.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the burned edge passed back becomes a conceptual re-pricing of failure into fertile difference, cost felt in the un-walked row between them. Causal chain holds—letter → vineyard parable → parallel vines → final silence—each beat tightening the asymmetry stake without external coincidence. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers sensory density until the pavilion’s “satisfied” hush and the hovering clearings re-weight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her withdrawal leaves the preserved silences hovering with conceptual cost: the pavilion can never again be merely stone. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. No causality breaks; every image answers to the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the latch-click and swifts’ arcs crystallize the mandate to keep returning, re-weighting the prior photos under the new “mended world” lens. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each photograph adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rusted factory ruins”). Causality is soft—no external obstacle escalates—but within the lyric pattern the final image carries felt cost: she leaves “no footprints,” accepting perpetual invisible labor. Slight deduction for repeat “arc” motif that over-counts its own resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystal’s echo returns her own uncertainty and re-weights the whole quest from recovery to open-ended listening; the conceptual cost—her data method is useless for what comes next—is legible in her closing the notebook. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strike→echo→transcription grows pattern-density until the final cadence breaks the pattern. Orientation anchors land by line 4; no因果 turns are required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the prophet drops the chalk and walks backward, leaving a half-erased tuning fork humming in dew—image reweights all prior chalk hunts by revealing their inevitable vanishing. Accumulative lens holds: each chalk screech layers sonic ghosts until the final, softer “wet sigh” of aging cracks the pattern open; cost is the chalk itself dissolving. Causality is interior but coherent—because he forgets, therefore he externalizes memory in driftwood and chalk; because chalk is consumed, therefore the hunt ends. No orientation debt: who/where/when (junkyard prophet, fog sculpture garden, twilight) anchor by line 3; pattern of echo-location taught immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: time braids, the hand’s motion becomes legible, and the camera clicks once—an image of echo, not event—paying the conceptual cost of perpetual flux. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-break (leaf sound) reweights the stake from capture to surrender. Orientation is swift: lunar observatory, zero-g, and existential quake are anchored within 50 words. No causality breaks; every lyrical repetition serves the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard dissolves into light-motes, reweighting reunification as connection-in-fracture; cost is the irreversible loss of her earthly instrument. Pattern is lyric-accumulative; each mundane hymn adds density until the final cadence reconfigures meaning without causal reversals. Orientation anchor—“the blood work came back at dawn”—arrives at word 3; transitions are legible within one continuous cloud-scene. Slight deduction for off-stage “blood work” trigger, but the on-page farewell hymn justifies the ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal lattice is airtight: each winding tightens the sky-noon distortion, cumulating in her crossing into the vault; the spoons’ fracture is the inciting rule, the key’s resonance is the reversible engine, and the new rune is the decisive change that re-stitches causality. Orientation is taught by line 4 via place & time; no teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost: noon now casts a shadow on time itself—a Resonant Reconfiguration that charges every prior measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the tooth’s underground pulse reweights the whole myth, making the garden a living threshold whose cost is the permanent cleft in certainty. Causal chain is tight: substitute body → skeptic’s pity → garden ritual → tooth left as marker → future townsfolk drawn into shared stewardship. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each lyrical shard adds density until the final cadence shift (“like a heart remembering how to beat”) reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4 and paid off at exit through the shifting maze hedges.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each stroke of cerium adds density until the final prismatic projection reweights the stake from private vow to communal solace. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard floats in the basin, refracting dawn onto villagers’ faces—options reconfigured, her silence now a resource, not absence. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“serpentine grotto”), temporal cue (“every solstice”). Cost legible: she forfeits speech and fire, accepts perpetual damp knees; the glass’s glow is purchased by years of salt-scoured surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each moss-covered server and thaw-drip pattern thickens ambience until the final amber streak re-configures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the confession print-out placed under moss supplies visible cost. One tightening—confession swallowed by green—deepens rather than narrows, satisfying the single required intensification for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: placing the shell reweights her entire manuscript ethic from closure to open witness. “Against the current” is literalized as sideways motion through mist; cost is the unwritten final chapter and the soaked boots—visible on page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each cameo thickens the pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence and sensory density build until the final reconfiguration (“the songs remained…in the pulse of the arbor itself”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the cost is the irrevocable return of ancestral song into living matter; the land, not Elara, pays first, but her future is now bound to guardianship. One causal micro-gap: the apparitions affect the world but never test Elara’s stamina or force her to renounce an alternative path, so the “price” is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clean in the first 120 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens: each discarded object layers density until the copper rivers glow, reweighting the stake from ritual to living map. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“subarctic crater”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plate’s thrum syncs with her pulse, map now alive inside her—cost is the blood drops and the enduring cold she accepts. No causality breaks; every placement is a because/therefore beat that tightens the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken timer becomes “a fulcrum” in an archive of wonder, and the cost is the locksmith’s permanent retreat from audience—felt in the final image of the sealed cavern. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each mirrored angle adds density until the final slab crystallizes meaning, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist applies her own ritual to herself, producing an Earned Stasis with visible cost—her locket rusted shut, silence calcified. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new calcified object thickens the grotto’s emotional sediment until the final beat reweights her own burden. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words (“bronze grotto under starlight… first snowmelt”). No causality breaks; lamp physics remain consistent. While closure could be sharper if the man’s case had rebound consequences on her tactics, the final image still reconfigures meaning under the selected lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, cedar scent, and wood-curls accrete until the cadence shift (“She set down the chisel…placed the carving where the light touched it”) reweights the stake from preservation to vessel-making. Closure is Earned Stasis: refusing tea and perfectionism for a visible cost—scorched pot, ash-dust hands, unfinished mane. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. Could nudge 9+ if kettle’s boil-dry left a sharper material scar on the loft or carving.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragment-gathering and camera-clicks builds density until the final flash reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she sits, legs dangling, camera empty, silence “thick as cloud,” cost felt in relinquished illusion of control. The envelope’s single line “frame it” re-prices the entire premise: regret is to be composed, not erased. Persistent constraint (no film, no pictures) shapes every late tactic and the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds from first step to final recalibration: each beat = because/therefore (ruptured line → redirection → warm breath → return of locals). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal is not “fixed” but re-cast as living maze; cost is the endless labor Elira embraces by pocketing the sextant again. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—entropy itself—shapes every tactic and the final image. Compression is purposeful, not elliptical; transitions are legible under single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first mercury-silent sentence to the final gilded dust-mote; each image thickens the pool of quiet until the droplet-on-score beat crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation—no who/where until “vaulted chamber beneath the old observatory,” but that hush-pays-off at closure when the sanctuary light re-anchors him. The droplet landing on the yellowed staff lines is the visible-cost hinge: before = unplayed scores, after = acceptance of stillness. No causality breaks; clocks “soften” rather than stop, an earned stasis that re-prices time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (sundial shadow, scratched-out face, canal exhale) adds density until the final “quiet ruins” reconfiguration lands. Orientation is swift: twilight canal, lone seeker, pocket tool all within 50 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—the locket’s inscription reweights every prior reflection on lies as shelter, not weapon—felt cost is the seeker’s acceptance of imperfection. Persistent constraint: the sundial’s shadow, not force, dictates timing, shaping his stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: she leaves with rope and promise, options re-weighted by Havel’s gift. Causal lens holds—each knot learned is a because/therefore step toward inheriting the weave. Orientation anchored by word 80; no debt. Cost is legible in the final image of the coiled “sleeping serpent of wisdom.” One hairline slip: “collecting hands” is abstract in the moment of realization, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of autumn garden and parchment deepens the dominant stake—how to keep the gone present. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: folding the crane and burying it beneath the dying rosebush reweights the act of writing from private salvage to gift-for-stranger, cost paid in exposure and relinquishment. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; orientation test waived because twilight garden disorientation serves the lyric closure. No causal plot turns, but pattern of densifying images (leaves, lichen, ink, thread) tightens once when thread glows—sufficient escalation under Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world’s frequency literally retunes from steam to birdsong, the cost the palace’s physical collapse and the prince’s enduring not-knowing if the egg will ever hatch. Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore link—egg → copper veins → tuning forks → resonance → skylight explosion. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“Below him…”). No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (acid rain, mockery) shapes tactics until final image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the red cord tied around an obsidian wrist reconfigures her inheritance into an ongoing vigil. Cost is unmistakable—she commits to daily return, radio already pulling her toward the next blaze. Causal linkage holds: because she inherited both match and hose, therefore she grafts memory onto redemption instead of burying it. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the lagoon’s harmonic wave is the density shift that reweights stakes; no contradiction or soft reset appears.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the first fountain’s single drop lands with undeniable conceptual cost—her quiet labor has reopened time itself; geese tilting wings externalize the reconfiguration. Causal chain holds: breadcrumb → key → box → steam of memories → civic weeping → fountain drop; each because/therefore link is visible. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) blooms by line 3 and is never lost; disorientation of paused geese is taught early and paid off at closure. Persistent constraint: once the box empties, it is “lighter” and she is committed to the next fountain—price shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s new soft pulses reweight the generational rule “burn to be bright” with visible conceptual cost—no flame, but glow. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift from falling petals to dancing petals reconfigures meaning without causal chain, valid under lyric mode. Orientation is clear by line 3, but the single-scene default is stretched by iterative pings that read like mosaic loops; transitions are legible via refrain, so Track B holds. Cost is felt in the final image; trouble remains poetic, not tangible, keeping score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: ribbon-tying cadence and butterfly wing-beats tighten density until the final image reweights grief as shared migration. Closure lands—Silas’s palm over heart crystallizes Charged Poise, cost legible in the shift from isolation to communal carving. Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity. Minor causality gap: ribbon’s transition from keepsake to loom occurs in reflective summary rather than pressured beat, blurring the pivot that enables later ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias’s palm on the pendulum bob crystallizes options—continue perfection or inhabit time—and the cost is the lifetime of diligence he must release. The accumulative lens holds: incremental absolution is reweighted from mechanical correction to surrendered witnessing. Drive lens is legible by midpoint; no orientation debt. The rake-handle micro-script is the causal pivot that makes the surrender earned, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry’s released smoke-reconfigures graves into “thresholds,” reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—she forfeits the comfort of lullabies forever. Causal chain holds: silo’s call → sovereign case warms → needle appears → stitches reveal her own silences. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 40; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the same stake—how to invite futures without dictating them. The final “Begin.” coupled to the spire’s sub-audible pulse delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the page hums, options are re-weighted, and the price (her maps will be misread) is named on the page. Orientation is achieved within 60 words; no causality break, though the17-year backstory is a compressed block it is anchored to present chill and paid off by her changed tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: her first pirate transmission crystallizes a new reciprocal network, the cost felt in the singed thumb and the exposed secrecy of the radio. Causal chain holds—dust motes only speak after lyrics + tears—and the lens stays accumulative/lyric to the final image of “another alcove would warm,” re-weighting solitude into collective risk. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“ember alcove”); no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the still rocker holds the cost of motion foregone, ash now irretrievably fused to portrait; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ash drift and stilling creak tightens the stake of witness vs. erasure—no causal ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer/catalogue entry thickens the stake of memory vs. erasure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cog on bell, water shifting—conceptual cost legible, but the beat is more tableau than tightening; no option is newly foreclosed, only re-affirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the girl’s question reframes the rosette table from relic to potential instrument, and Elara’s “Good… you haven’t learned how to get it wrong yet” conceptually reweights failure as prerequisite to harmony. Causality is lyrical but legible—every reflective block is anchored to tactile present (finger on wood, hum in throat) and culminates in an offer that could not occur without the prior subtraction of noise. The velvet library, autumn leaf, and rosette object constrain the final choice: they literally provide the silent chamber where new resonance can begin. Cost is felt: the last maple leaf “trembling but not yet falling” images her own enduring vulnerability now reopened to pupils.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the crooked sapling maps its own path through ruin, reweighting the greenhouse and Elara’s vocation forever. Causality holds: every prune-snipped memory feeds the seed via synaptic plasticity, itself foreshadowed by twin-moon tide language. Felt cost is legible in the refusal to harvest and the lifelong tending she accepts. The only micro-slip: one sentence of overt theme-label (“That was the point”) could have been compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the tower collects belief, not lightning—conceptual repricing with felt cost implicit in the swarm’s hum. Causal chain is tight: riddle → drone reveal → capacitor function → belief inversion. Accumulative lens holds; each matchbox thickens texture until the final re-weighting. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard’s dissolution reconfigures the bay’s lullaby and frees the cottage ghost, cost paid in her permanent exile from the houses she loves. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each displaced object tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift releases the lingering architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the violet light cascade reweights every prior “fall” image to “threshold” with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens taught early (layered murals, ampoule, foxglove dye) and held to final dissolve. The hairline fracture in the knee—a structural weakness introduced at midpoint—pays off as the literal break that releases light, satisfying causality with elegant circularity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the liquid-glass ripple lets him touch the unlived moment, the die disappears, and the ascent rewrites itself from mourning to material. Causality is accumulative/textural—each carved equation is swallowed, digested, and returned as propulsion; the final image reweights the rule-set so perpetual motion now includes him as carrier rather than victim. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation early and paid off when geometry liquefies; cost is palpable in the empty pocket and the taller stance. No teleporting props; the missing corner of the die is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics until it vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the teenage stranger entering to co-paint reconfigures the painter’s solitary mission into a communal future, the cost being her anonymity and the finite moonlight left tonight. Causal chain is tight—each glyph’s street-level echo is traced back to the brush—so the lens is cleanly causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: “We are not preserving art. We are becoming it” reweights the stake from salvage to self-creation under an accumulative lens. The lens is taught early via repeating bread-and-lens pattern; transitions are legible. Cost is felt—the city’s silence is broken, anonymity sacrificed—but the causal chain is lightly sketched; we never see Elara debate the danger of exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: yoyo-heart → mainspring → counter-clockwise beam reversal → cracked fate → gear-from-tomorrow. Orientation (who-where-when) is clear within 40 words; the single-scene default is met. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“tomorrow’s clocks would tick backward by his hand”—with undeniable conceptual cost (lighthouse fissures, ash remains). Only the slightest ellipsis around paradox mechanics keeps it from 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a sharp Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored-self Fear dissolves when shown its own image, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the rule-set. Causal lens holds: because the protagonist extracts and displays the toxic memories, Fear collapses. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the clasp’s pulse—shapes pacing. Cost is felt in the final stillness, though slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the black sea softens, harmonic rain falls, and the tide carries the music inward—an undeniable before/after with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: each mallet strike → cloud shift → Kael’s dub → final helix. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“blue hour… orchard afloat”) and waiver applies because disorientation pays off in the closing image. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern intensifies until the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because watcher turns, therefore she acts; because journals found, therefore pattern language devised. Single-scene orientation secured inside 120 wds (who=cartographer, where=apartment overlooking turtle-shell city, when=seventeenth dry season). Closure is Charged Poise: on-page image of whistle tucked “like a second heart” crystallizes both challenge and potential annihilation. Cost is undeniable—she steps into the ridge’s lethal silence—no reset possible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: discovery→plan→exit, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—she steps off the platform having foreclosed the heroic path, rose-petal image reweighting the lie she will dismantle. Cost is felt—“no triumph in her stride”—but not yet paid in flesh or social capital, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each note thickens the palimpsest of absence until the copper-tube letter triggers the decisive emotional breach. Orientation is anchored within 90 words; the single transition (dusk→dawn) is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty inkwell and refilled water/tears reweight memory’s conservation. Cost is legible in the final image—“lighter—not hollow, but clarified.”

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery (ledger, sealed vents, Master Index) is a because/therefore linkage narrowing options toward the final “truth reclaimed” stamp. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses silence by endorsing the codex, paying the cost of future danger. Orientation clean—sunken library, blackout, Cycle 7—by line 5. Cost is legible: “the city hadn’t drowned passively—it had been allowed to sink” reweights every prior clue.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shadow becomes mirror, the isle drifts into grief-grace dimension, and the sideways motion reweights every prior lantern. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of folded grief, gem-polished dreams, cranes descending-while-ascending—culminating in the sapphire’s silent polish that collapses the world. Orientation is taught early via “gravity wept” and “time curled,” waiver applies. Cost is legible in the final chord that folds pain into lift.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: each simulation collapses → therefore new coordinates → therefore thrusters fire. Closure is Charged Poise: “the observatory leapt into the dark” reweights stakes with undeniable cost—she leaves safety forever. Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Setup of “Cradle of Cold Eyes” pays off as launch site, not mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist abandons the search frequency for internal resonance, cost legible in her deliberate stillness. Causal linkage is loose—chip activation is externally prompted by star-map alignment rather than a prior mistake or desire creating the necessity; luck governs the turn. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 120 words; no spatial drift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: accruing sensory memories reweight belonging; pattern holds through final image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: because she forged identities, therefore the shore returns her father's carving; because she activates the watch, therefore she learns the withheld truth and chooses reversal. The driftwood-as-memory-sieve conceit is taught early ("this was how the hush worked") and lands with clear Decisive Change plus visible cost—the carvings dissolve, the watch goes silent, her trade flips. Orientation within 120 words is clean; only a trace of lens drift at midpoint (lyric accumulative) but closure re-centers causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the relic swap is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the shared silence cost legible. Causal chain is thin—no concrete obstacle is overcome on stage—but under the Accumulative lens the tightening of atmospheric density and the mirrored grief suffice; the drawer-pull cue anchors every reflection block, so orientation stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: the patterned pole-naming and compass refrains tighten into a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes her own pole star. Closure lands with visible cost: she relinquishes certainty and inherited charts. The washer talisman and “compass as witness” crystallize the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the released ball drifts into brightest light, reconfiguring meaning—empathy kindled, hollownow carries resonance instead of void. Causal linkage holds: because the ball floats and shows unlived cruelties, therefore the seeker leaves it—visible cost is the forfeiture of the only “real” relic. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via layered newspaper clues, density tightens when fractal ripples replace circles. One shard + continuous climb-out satisfies scope; no orientation debt—who/where/when anchored by ~100 words (“Layer 7,” “janitor’s closet,” “after the procedure”).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via patterned aroma imagery and holds to the Charged Poise closure: the moon-synced heartbeat + spice-cloud lift reconfigures meaning without causal reversals. Anchors (who/where/when) are vivid by line 5; no orientation debt. The fortune-cookie reprise at the end provides a crisp Conceptual Repricing that reweights “invitation” into covenant, with felt cost: she walks onward carrying saffron and sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the saucer sealed, the child’s voice rising from below, the mother descending “not as cartomancer, but as mother.” Cost is felt in the smudge of earth and starlight on her fingers and the unfastening of her grip on the past. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of birthday tracings, ink, cracks—until the cadence shift of clouds parting reweights meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the gate opens, the Tear dissolves, Elira crosses with earned lightness. Causality is poetic—emotional gravity calibrates the stitch—but the rule-set is taught only retrospectively; earlier beats rely on lyric declaration more than visible constraint, so the lens feels Accumulative/Textural rather than tight Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: the twelfth bottle’s self-shattering and airborne HERE-NOW-YOU trail visibly reconfigure meaning and cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The black-sand stage, bottled destinies, and celestial metronome are taught by 25 % and converge in the final image without causal cheats; the only minor slack is that the “prophecy” mechanic is asserted more than demonstrated in beat-by-beat causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens: each geometric trace adds density rather than causal turn; the blackout’s slow lift supplies a resonant reconfiguration (CR) that reweights the “cradle of sparks” from abstract to imminent. Closure lands with conceptual cost: dawn exposes the conspiracy, yet the sentinel’s own fate is untouched, capping the effect just below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Charged Poise—the concentric-ring sphere lands a resonant reconfiguration that converts the promise from answer-seeking to question-crafting, cost visible in the grandmother-memory flare and the sudden silence of the curse. Frictionless world-rule is taught early and paid off at every tactile beat; aurora-paint merger with rock geometry provides the density shift that reweights stakes. Pattern taught by 25% with Fibonacci placement; transitions are legible within a single continuous scene; orientation anchored by “bare feet on slick stone” at ~50 words; no disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal spine: because the poet’s voice is excised, she charts scars → therefore hoards the last poem → therefore suspends the vigil rather than break it. Closure is a Charged Poise: the unopened envelope reconfigures the stake from “Will she read?” to “She will decide when the sky says,” with felt cost in the timer’s silence. Orientation perfect: observatory, storm night, lone actor anchored by line 3. No meaningful escalation after midpoint—pressure plateaus rather than tightens—so misses 9.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the partners abandon the physical key (needle card) and accept the unending labor of “performing” the lost overture everywhere—an off-page life-sentence legible in the final line. Causal lattice holds: 10:17 and 11:03 shadows are set up, tested, and paid off in the decisive alignment that turns silence into score. Waiting compresses three dawns into one present-tense countdown; the missing hours on the sundial mirror the missing music, a taught pattern that charges the ending image. Cost is unmistakable: the card stays on the table, its secrets now an unshareable burden they carry.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: image-density (tin, candle, seeds, poem) reweights the stake from coin-survival to beauty-in-ruin. Closure is a Charged Poise: candle burning beneath the poem + seeds pressed into cracks = undeniable conceptual cost; world is already changed before dawn. Causality intact: each object returns with new freight, no props teleport. Orientation anchored by word 50; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each harmonic gambit tightens because/therefore logic—condensation → playable ivory → gravity bend → clock tick → film burn → dawn shatter. Closure is a Decisive Change: midnight keeps advancing, horizon flips to dawn, reel combusts, laughter becomes present-tense. Cost is visible: the clock hands never reset, the reel is ash, the arbor’s starlight threads are spent. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and paid off when the horizon literally shatters its own rule.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: the fractal ridge hovers, autonomous archive created, monsoon now answerable to dream-fed memory. Causal linkage holds—because Aris plants the seed after interpreting Elira’s dream, therefore the archive awakens—yet the price (loss of the last seed) is stated more than felt. Single-scene orientation is clear by line 6; no debt applied. Lens ambiguity cap not triggered; Accumulative/Textural drive inferred and held.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass stills, color diffuses, and the islet’s emotional load is redistributed—an undeniable conceptual shift with felt cost. Causal logic is lyric-accumulative rather than event-driven; each lace gesture layers regret until color materializes, a pattern taught early and paid off. Orientation is secure inside 120 words. Minor waiver: the Severance backstory is delivered in one dense lump rather than dramatized, but it functions as premise, not resolution, so lens holds.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “I found them here, in the dust” reweights the entire premise, revealing cosmic order in entropy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sedimentation, pattern formation, and perceptual shifts, not causal turns. Cost is legible in her abandoned career, changed methodology, and recalibrated identity. Every beat tightens around the thesis that decay is refinement, culminating in a resonant final image charged with earned awe.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger’s reinterpreted purpose transforms survival into sacred duty, with visible cost in shattered glass repurposed, not replaced. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—frost patterns, ash, starlight accrue density until the synchrony moment crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors instantly (“cold stone,” “canyon under stars”), and the pattern of retracing tightens stakes without causal breaks. Final image of glass “singing back” makes conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined not as absence but as a medium of emotional thermals. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—thermal mappings intensify into a symphony of warmth, culminating in the conservatory’s “hum.” Cost is legible in the earth’s “deep, slow thrum” felt through gloves: a world forever altered, yet alive. Every structural beat tightens the premise without causal rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker endures and reconfigures his exile into active ministry, transforming distress into belonging. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—pressure builds via harmonic tremors, floating books, spectral impressions—culminating in the amber pulse that reweights silence into release. Cost is legible: his chased stillness settles “within him,” hands stop trembling, yet he accepts perpetual labor (“more signals waiting”). Orientation anchors instantly (“weary undertaker,” “drowned spires of Vaelith”) and pay off in the cathedral-like library closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell’s first ring crystallizes collective agency without naming actors, reconfiguring anonymity from secrecy to invitation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure intensifies via sanctions, yet care compounds through patterned acts. Cost is legible in Elira’s enduring labor and the community’s quiet sacrifices. Every shard coheres under this lens, taught by the opening image and fulfilled in the final note-bearing baskets.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: unused love isn’t stored but sung—a reweighting of the story’s central premise with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout; patterned sensory density (petals → faces, arches → arms) intensifies until the tear unfurls into mist. Cost is legible in the final image: the viaduct blooms brighter only after the artist surrenders the quest for location, accepting resonance over retrieval. Orientation is immediate (“beneath the twilight viaduct”), and the single scene coheres without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elira realizes the garden stitches causality using her memories as thread, transforming her goal from pursuit to acceptance. The drive lens—Accumulative/Textural—is clear by paragraph two and held through the ash-spiral climax. Cost is legible in the disintegrated photos and vanished anchors; the final touch reweights the entire premise. Orientation is precise within 30 words (“hedge maze designer… living bridge garden”).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wall’s physical imminence is reframed by the liberator’s act of sowing, making green inevitable regardless of human violence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (dust motes like pollen, humming notes) until the vault opens not with force but vibration. Cost is legible in the final image: “the weight of seeds against her ribs heavier than any iron.” Orientation anchors instantly (“chained liberator,” “abandoned carnival”), and the piano cipher pays off causally without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist crystallizes her stance—harvesting silence into a compass—and departs, foreclosing return with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: sensory density intensifies (color-sounds shift, aurora chimes), culminating in the fracture’s whisper. Cost is legible in the final image: “ashes now sacred,” her body battered, yet purpose fulfilled. Orientation anchors (“sunken orchard greenhouse,” “shipwrecks”) are clear by line 2 and serve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the thief’s final departure crystallizes her role as translator of fate, with visible cost—the half-empty jar, the soul “brimming” yet physically alone. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: patterns (flower codes, moonbeam use) intensify toward reweighted meaning, not causal cause/effect. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“emerald station by moonlight”), and the two shards (man/woman, old couple) cohere under one thematic closure. Cost is legible in the cooled jar and the thief’s quiet withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the glass spheres reweight the control room from crisis hub to sanctuary, with conceptual cost legible in the suspended bookmark—a fossilized prayer for knowledge after institutional collapse. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, deepening via rhythmic narration and sensory layering (ice drip → furnace hum → glass chimes). Orientation anchors immediately (“abandoned control room,” “Great Frost”), and the structural thaw mirrors internal transformation without causality breaks. Final image crystallizes stakes: wonder over certainty, questions over answers.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she walks out not as stunt double or victim but “firmly adaptive,” with visible cost in lost identity and consumed past. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (shell, cast, rust, stars) until the film’s burning reweights everything. Orientation is immediate (“rusted library,” “I used to be someone else”), and the causal chain from discovery to decryption to destruction is tight. The final image of ash and salt-air makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    This is an Accumulative/Textural piece that tightens through cadence and density, not causality. The ambered hush deepens as silence is summarized, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the endless night becomes navigable via coordinates of absence. Cost is legible in “time measured in sighs” and the guttering star—a live constraint shaping every gesture. Closure lands with undeniable resonance: she enters the mapped dark, leaving only flaking gold and summarized silence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)

    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Accumulative/Textural in its layering of wonder motifs, Causal in the drone revelation—and holds it coherently to closure. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30. The ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the blackout isn’t failure but evolution, with the cost being withheld knowledge (Elias’s silence). Every beat tightens pressure toward the Charged Poise of the humming drones in rain—closure is earned, resonant, and conceptually costly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (shard, hush, thresholds) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vanished cottage “unclenches its ghostly fingers.” Cost is legible in the closing image—the shard dissolves, but sanctification lingers as emotional and atmospheric change. Orientation is immediate (“barefoot along the quiet bay in spring”), and the single scene tightens around one meaningful deepening: the act of placement reweights memory as sacred. Closure lands with conceptual cost: honoring requires release, not preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Truth is not monolith. It is mosaic” reweights the entire premise, transforming “Fall” into “threshold.” The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—revelations cascade via density increase (glyphs shifting, murals illuminating), culminating in the statue’s dissolution and the historian’s new purpose. Cost is legible: the historian abandons her life’s singular narrative, trading academic certainty for fluid truth. Orientation is immediate (“ankle-deep in kelp”), and every beat tightens pressure toward the ampoule’s shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the staircase ripples, he touches the reflection of his frozen past self, and resumes climbing without the die—foreclosing nostalgia as burden while integrating its texture into future action.

Every shard coheres; the pattern is taught early and pays off without disorientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time is rewound, droughts erased, but at the cost of the lighthouse’s ruin and the hunger stone’s ash—making “the world, at last, would eat” legible as both triumph and burden. The Causal lens holds: every action (yoyo dissection, mainspring insertion) triggers the next consequence. Orientation is immediate (“lighthouse on a rocky island”), and the paradoxical loop (future self sends yoyo to past self) tightens rather than confuses stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: fissured stone, retreating tide, solitary gull.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: fear is revealed not as ruler but as “a reflection,” reweighting the entire premise with undeniable cost—the protagonist must relive his drowning to achieve liberation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure intensifying through sensory density (mirrors, mannequins, reversed lullabies) until the final beat crystallizes meaning.
