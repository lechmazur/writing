  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Elara discovers the frost-free tracks and begins walking with visible cost (three days of cold, bruised fingers, the destroyed workshop). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—sensory particulars and the temperature-memory concept deepen until the final image reweights her stance from paralysis to purposeful pursuit. Orientation is clear early (canyon, after arson, night to dawn). One meaningful tightening occurs when the frost reveals the invisible tracks, narrowing her options from blind flight to guided pursuit. The cost is legible but slightly abstract; pointing to "bruised fingers" and "stiff joints" provides felt consequence, yet the story could sharpen the moment of forfeiture (what she gives up by following this path) for a stronger 8+ claim.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. The plot follows a single continuous scene: Elian detects thermal distress, intervenes with the ceramic rod, and restores the orchids' heat. However, closure reads as a return to baseline (flowers stabilized, case closed, "satisfied") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost; the protagonist has not altered, renounced, or crystallized a stance that forecloses a live option. The inferred lens is Causal (problem → solution sequence), but the ending lacks the visible price or reweighted meaning required for a valid closure effect under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph (Silas, underwater library, post-package arrival). The drive lens reads Causal: package arrives → journey → beacon repair → silence achieved. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas slots the lens and the machine groans to life, ceasing the distress signals. Closure is a Decisive Change—the screaming stops, ghosts dissolve—with a felt cost (three days walking the ocean floor, "forcing his body through fissures"). The final image of "crushing quiet" reweights the opening pressure. Minor slip: the ease of the mechanical fix deflates some earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by the opening). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through descriptive density and thematic layering rather than causal turns. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elara returns to her post with the bell's weight as a reminder—but no on-page decision or renunciation alters her options; the final image recapitulates the opening stance without visible cost. The story deepens atmosphere but does not tighten pressure or foreclose a live path, leaving the closure unit under-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are solid within the first quarter (who, where, when), and the causal chain from past-life memory to bridge pilgrimage to spirit encounter to healing flows cleanly. The closure—Silas's chest lightening, realizing love is action not storage—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he releases the accumulated pressure and accepts the pilgrim's task). Cost is legible: the "ancient pressure in his heart significantly reduced" and his readiness to continue signal a path foreclosed and a new stance crystallized. One tightening (ghost appears, thorns revealed, love channeled) suffices for this length under a Causal lens with Accumulative undertones.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 3). Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Elian's theft and weaving cause the geometric trap, which triggers the disintegration closure. The closure—photographs shatter, texture of time is felt—lands on the page with visible cost (trauma remnants dissolved, weeping). One meaningful tightening occurs when he shoves the fragment into the convergence point, narrowing options and delivering the change. The bridge's "quaking reverie" and the disintegration sequence are legible under the lens, though the hyperbolic geometry mechanism arrives late and could constrain earlier tactics more visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal chain: mob breach → Elias decodes keys → vault seals → intruders arrive. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Elias faces gun barrels knowing his work is done, his life forfeited for future harvest. The inferred lens is Causal with situational pressure. Minor weakness: the hydraulic hiss and blast doors cycle without friction or complication; the mechanism works perfectly on first attempt, softening escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when anchored). The piece reads as single-scene Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the ritual, and the closure image ("captured the ghost in the machine") reconfigures the opening obsession. However, no on-page cost alters Elara's options or stance; the imprint succeeds without friction, and the final paragraph asserts success rather than dramatizing a felt price. Closure form is present but the cost remains conceptual and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens: amber warmth → moonlit green → volatile alchemical reaction. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when the stranger mouths her secret name, reweighting causality (past watching future) with undeniable conceptual cost—her anonymity and safety are compromised. The final image crystallizes fate's intrusion, but the cost remains implied rather than felt in a micro-choice or visible forfeiture, holding this just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texturing. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening lines). The escalation sequence—melt destabilizing foundation, floor tilting, tools sliding—tightens causally and forces the abandonment decision. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): leaving the high ground with the dome behind forecloses the sanctuary with felt cost and the final image of descending into "muddy valley" reweights the opening's frozen preservation. Cost is legible in the monument dome and the shift from "shelter" to "tomb."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias locks himself in the enclosed dark he fears, inverting the expected escape, with the felt cost that "he was still terrified of the dark" even as it saves him. The causal lens holds: his anxiety-driven observational skills enable the override discovery, and his choice to invert rather than escape flows from established traits. Orientation anchors (rusted library, Elias paralyzed, timeframe post-betrayal) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the five-minute countdown forces the decrypt action.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara, pebble-shore oracle), where (ridge fort courtyard), and when (final star's extinction) within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (gold flake, silence gaps, charcoal lines) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise at the ending when the map is complete and she walks into the night, accepting the cost of total darkness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the star winks out, forcing the final act. Escalation is texture-driven rather than causal, appropriate for the lens, and the closure lands with cost (loss of light, acceptance of oblivion) that is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (who, where, when by paragraph two) and maintains a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: the cleanup task structures the sequence while ghostly figures accumulate into the violin. Closure arrives on-page as the violin is recycled, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—734 archives data and moves on without foreclosing a meaningful path or altering his stance. The "job well done" framing softens what could have been a Charged Poise moment where his philosophical search confronts its own futility with sharper pressure. The escalation is present but gentle; one more tightening that forced a choice between curiosity and duty would solidify high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines; the timeframe "after words become unnecessary" and telepathic world rules are taught early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the lens-and-ticket ritual, and emotional frequency revelation, culminating in Mara's acceptance (she pockets the tickets, sharing the burden). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—trust restored through an archaic medium—with visible cost (she becomes complicit in his crime). One persistent constraint (the world's move past words) shapes tactics throughout. The causal chain is clean: suspicion → demonstration → emotional hit → barrier drop → shared burden.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Elian, the maze, the sub-prefect's gauge by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Situational-Accumulative hybrid: pressure from the "statistically dead" verdict accumulates through Elian's ritual until the marble-prism moment crystallizes his stance and validates his method with visible physical effect (leaf revival, gauge confusion). Closure is Charged Poise / Conceptual Repricing: the final exchange and image ("broken tools cast the brightest light") reweights the luck-versus-care premise with felt cost (decades of penance, patient labor) legible on the page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (research station, Elian, twilight storm) arrive within the first 100 words. The drive lens is Causal: Elian's preparation (weeks of waiting, device assembly) → lever pull → holographic manifestation → closure choice to withhold proof. Closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost: he returns to the "obliging" mechanic role, foreclosing the radical leap, holding the warmth of secret truth against the cold. The cost—remaining trapped in his linear life—is felt in the final image of the wrench and his planned complicity tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elias, flooded orchestra pit, present-tense investigation) arrive promptly. The piece accumulates pressure through water-damage revelation, stillness, disruption, and discovery in a coherent chain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the silence finally felt complete, a resolved chord"—the investigation ends with acknowledgment rather than a decisive change. Cost is conceptual (the conversation finished, leaving him alone) but the final image could land harder; the phrasing "leaving him alone once more" diffuses rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (Elias, weather station, post-fever dawn) and establishes a clear stake: suppress catastrophic data without violating core programming. The smudge action creates a meaningful turn that reweights the forecast models, and the ending crystallizes a Charged Poise—Elias alone will see the end coming through the haze he created, a cost felt even if not yet paid. The drive lens reads as Causal with a situational accent (the manipulated system constrains his stance). Minor friction: the mechanism by which a physical smudge alters digital confidence intervals relies on exposition ("biological flag for increased entropy") rather than fully dramatized causality, but the cost at closure is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: radio feedback warns of structural weakness, Silas follows it to the valve, the caller's confession triggers the "ghost shift," and his appraisal of the sealed valve answers his question about negligence vs. malice. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the valve's position proves mechanical negligence can look like murder—and the cost is legible: Silas carries his own secret slightly lighter but still burdened. One meaningful tightening occurs when the radio confession cuts to silence and the mill "wakes up," narrowing Silas's interpretive frame and delivering the judgment he sought.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the library's decay accumulates pressure until the swelling river forces transition, and the obsidian refuge offers a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis qualifying as RR). Orientation anchors quickly (Chronicle Keeper, overgrown library, catacombs). The origami-swan mechanism provides a single meaningful tightening that narrows spatial options and delivers Elara to the refuge, where regenerative silence crystallizes her final stance. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the archive and her role—but the final image makes the trade-off legible: "no longer a keeper of books, but a keeper of the quiet."

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through environmental convergence (eclipse, music, tactile anchor) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the light in Elara's eyes remained"). The closure reweights the premise (ordinary magic responsive to eclipse) with felt cost (the moment is fragile, ending as totality ends). Causality is clean: eclipse → heightened magic → memory linkage → Elara's momentary return. One meaningful deepening (the "link snapped into place") tightens the dominant stake. The cost is legible but whisper-light; the final image does not foreclose a visible path, and the "session was over" tag undersells the stakes slightly (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors who (Elian, historian), where (silo library), and the post-dream premise clearly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds through the astronomer's archive toward a conceptual repricing at the end—humanity's last dream is recovered and understood. The closure unit (Elian recognizing the tragedy, the structure "relaxing," and his departure) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the structure unburdened), though the felt cost to Elian himself is oblique. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tapestry is revealed as a scientific instrument, reweighting prior description.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as causal-situational hybrid with Arthur's agency driving the final act. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Arthur manually redirects the lighthouse beam to broadcast his resignation across the sky, which crystallizes his break from the network with felt peace and shifts the lighthouse from fortress to "familiar enigma." Cost is present but implied more than dramatized—he smiles and feels peace, yet the social, operational, or survival price remains offstage. The prophetic examples (leak, heart attack) are backstory nodes that establish the problem but do not escalate on the page; the decisive deepening occurs when he stands and reaches for the hydraulic levers. One meaningful tightening is present, satisfying the 600–800 word expectation, though the cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal: each loop and rhetorical device narrows the entity's grip in a because/therefore chain, culminating in the palette's paint becoming "muddy ash" and Elias gasping free—a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (the entity expelled, Elias's trauma acknowledged). Orientation anchors (station, priest, possessed Keeper, palette) land by ~100 words. One weakness: the entity's mechanics (why chiasmus and antithesis work) rely on assertion rather than demonstrated world rules, but the closure effect itself is legible and earned by Kellen's escalating acoustic tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory and conceptual elements (grease-pencil mapping, shell resonance, mirrored horizon) toward a cadence shift at dawn that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (Silas, Glass Spire, frozen lake, present action fighting exhaustion) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the ache vanishing, replaced by harmonic alignment) with felt cost (years of toil, isolation, the narrow window before exhaustion). One meaningful deepening occurs when visual duality locks and the traced memories produce the transcendent chord, tightening all prior texture into a single convergent moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (floating → retracing → landing) build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's boots strike stone and timelines fuse. The closure carries felt cost—she loses buoyancy and gains "crushing burden"—and the droplet motif seeds early and returns charged at the ripple. Orientation anchors (Elara, viaduct, post-storm twilight) appear within the first ~80 words, satisfying the test. One structural friction: the procedural-generation conceit is asserted but its mechanics remain vague, and the tablet's crumbling feels convenient rather than causally prepared. The ending image is legible and cost is on the page, holding the lens without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the backward-playing ritual builds pressure through sensory intensification until the dam fractures, creating a Decisive Change with felt cost (numbness replaced by raw sorrow). Orientation anchors (Silas, cavern, antique turntable) arrive early. The closure unit is on the page and causally earned by the ritual's escalating tactile feedback. One meaningful deepening occurs when the needle hits the run-out groove and the filament snaps, forcing the emotional break. Minor tension: the "ready to teach again" coda feels like a half-step beyond the grief release without showing the stance crystallization that bridges them.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows a causal lens: Elara is followed → retreats → gate breaks → escapes laterally, and the carrier pigeon message introduces a meaningful complication. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she has lost her station but preserved independence and the secret message—with conceptual cost visible ("they could not reach the data she carried"). One meaningful tightening (the gate break forcing the lateral climb) is present, though the final image's cost could be more sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Silas, canyon grotto, post-arrival). The piece follows a Hybrid lens: causal in the spiral-laying and wall-scraping sequence, then Accumulative/Textural as sensory density builds ("silk dragged over gravel"), resolving via Earned Stasis when Silas pulls his hand away and destroys the pattern. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—he chooses "the pain of limitation over the void of perfection"—and the frayed rope's smoking anchors the price physically. One minor seam: the energy beings "intensify their glow" but their reaction doesn't materially narrow his options before the rope begins to smoke.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through sensory density and thematic recurrence until the final image—"a canvas waiting for the next night's imperfect performance"—reweights the dominant stake (survival through ritual against silence). Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the quality of silence shifts from void to canvas, and the cost (the unresolved note, the ongoing need) is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs as the violin's cry finds the dome's resonant frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene anchored by ~line 4 (amber grotto, client behind him, workbench) and progresses causally: Silas prepares the blotter → explains half-truths → administers the scent → observes the effect. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for Elara; Charged Poise for Silas): her devastation is replaced by "glassy, serene understanding," and Silas feels "the transaction finished, the illusion absolute"—a visible cost (authentic emotion subsumed) that forecloses the path of raw grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when she inhales and the static "spikes of her agony" level into "a low, manageable hum." The inferred lens is Causal, held cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: Elias approaches with the envelope, delivers it, and the librarian's response crystallizes his moral stance. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Charged Poise—where the invitation to sit and share the story reweights the transaction from duty to connection. The felt cost is present but muted: Elias risks vulnerability and the librarian opens her guarded professionalism, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a single-POV accumulative structure: Elara's search culminates in the woven-reed offering that secures communal acceptance. Orientation anchors (post-verbal world, crystalline orchard, crater's edge) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—kinship thread wrapping her heart—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The phrase "she was finally home" tells rather than shows the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with visible cost: Elara ages visibly, secures the sketch, and escapes the waking giant. The causal lens holds cleanly—borrowed time enables the climb, uncaging the echo creates the sketch, expiration forces retreat. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the giant's interrupted cadence cracks her temporal stasis, narrowing her window and forcing the final push.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (cavern, moonlight, ritual setup), and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density accrues toward a final image reweighting. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the meadow vision shifts his calculus from solving for return to accepting her destination—but the cost remains abstract. The "data had changed" line asserts a recalibration without dramatizing what he now sacrifices or forecloses; the stakes ("to understand the mathematics of emotion") don't visibly narrow. The ritual unfolds in summary exposition, weakening causal linkage between beats.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: power surge → debris shifts → Elias finds tape → cache plan → librarian discovers it. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the end of paragraph one. The closure—her discovery reweighting his isolation—occurs on the page with felt cost (his retreat into shadow, acceptance of invisibility's end). One meaningful tightening drives the arc (finding tape → risk of proximity → withdrawal). The cost is legible in "the heavy cloak of his isolation dissolve into the light," though the librarian's prior desperation is summary rather than dramatized choice, weakening the stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (who, where, storm context). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative overtones: Elias's attempt to reconstruct the hybrid tightens his suffering, and releasing control becomes the necessary reversal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he surrenders agency to survive, forecloses the human-scientist path, and the final image of listening to rain "as growth" reweights his consciousness with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes fighting is "the very thing killing him," narrowing options to surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias pockets the amber, commits to painting it against the void, and reframes his insomnia as vigil—options narrow (survival forfeited for art) with felt cost on the page. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (rain trails → tunnel reveal → exchange → final commitment); the piece teaches its method early and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors (tidal island, post-war, Elias painting) arrive within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening (the exchange) reconfigures stakes and the ending crystallizes the new stance with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's withdrawal breaks the shadow bridge but accepts the lesson, foreclosing her old method with felt cost. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (bioluminescent pulse, symphonic resonance, layered sensory detail) and holds it through the ending image, which reweights her vision practice. One orientation slip: "after the pilgrim arrives" (timeframe element) is stated but the precise trigger moment and spatial entry path remain slightly vague until Kael "shuffled into the chamber." Causality is clean—shadow geometry enables the entity's arrival, pearl transforms, Elara withdraws—though the midpoint leans into reflection that slows momentum slightly before the climactic shadow-merge.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through sensory accumulation (wet stone, fog, posture shifts) toward a cadence-shift closure where the steam-horn sequence dissolves tension and reweights the navigated absences into community. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Decisive Change)—the final note and murmur of recognition confirm the transformation with felt cost (Elian's solitary archive work now rewritten as communal act). Cost is visible in "the pause in their history was over" and "satisfied that the fragments had coalesced." One meaningful deepening (the valve installation and staggered sequence) tightens the stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and maintains spatial coherence through the train yard to the floating vault. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and metaphysical imagery build toward the final crystallization when Elara shatters her jar, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (the truth "integrating the fractured parts of her history into a single, legible path"). Cost is present but abstract—"sharp and purifying" reads more declarative than felt. The escalation from sidewalk arrows to impossible staircase to the vault follows a clear intensification pattern, though the final beat's emotional price could be more concretely embodied to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise): Elara commits to the archival work despite academic risk, and the final image of "resonant quiet" reweights the tower's silence with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered memory, whale song, and the magic square's deepening function until the final cadence shift ("full, a resonant quiet"). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes Silas anchored sorrows, shifting her stake from cataloging to sanctuary. The cost (academic standing, protection of mocked history) is legible but somewhat oblique; a sharper on-page consequence or forfeited option would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through density and conceptual layering (pocket dimension rejection, magnetic drilling, artifact weeping) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian's realization that "the 'after' was not a place...but a frequency" and his step into dissolution. Closure lands with felt cost (physical dissolution, consciousness fraying) and reweights the opening boredom. Orientation anchors (cross-legged, prismatic escondite, solar storm) arrive early. One meaningful deepening (the fissure opening, revealing cessation of geometry) narrows options and charges the final act. Causality remains motivated under accumulative logic; no breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story anchors who/where/when quickly and follows a clear causal chain: Julian offers the ink, Vance signs, the ink rewrites his intent, Elena receives asylum papers. The closure is a Decisive Change—Vance's authorization—paired with Julian's satisfied ledger-balancing, and the cost is legible (Vance's "shock of his own humanity," his retreat). However, the ink's mechanics arrive late and resolve the problem it did not help create, which weakens earned escalation; the piece leans on a magical object rather than Julian's agency at the decisive moment. The lens is Causal with a situational accent, held cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece holds single POV and follows one continuous scene with clear orientation (who, where, when established by ~100 words). Escalation reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory input (lamp hum + light refraction + gold leaf absorption), culminating in a quiet closure where the "ghost" is locked into the page. The final tactile test ("cold, sharp echo") constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost visible in "false memories" and the weight of guardianship. One minor causality question: the "temporal flow breach" mechanism is asserted but not dramatized, reducing felt stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes its pattern early—scavenging fragments, layering emotional residue—and the poison label functions as the anchor for one full cycle of the method. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (who, where, premise). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator commits to perpetual witnessing and the final image reweights the opening premise with the cost of isolation and namelessness made undeniable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the label "began to vibrate with a constructed sorrow," shifting it from trash to monument. Cost is legible but oblique—emotional and social rather than physical.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors early (rusted gantry, collapsing sky) and sustains Accumulative/Textural pressure: the cello's resonance builds toward the ephemeral compass, which triggers past-conversation replays that force Elias's retelling. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he accepts "the riddle had no answer, only a song" and becomes part of the myth. Cost is visible: he abandons debunking and shouts his fear and loneliness aloud as the walls fold. One tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal: Elara's choice to reorganize the city through graffiti messages narrows the developer's options and the stone placement redefines legal coordinates—both motivated and linked by because/therefore logic. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the city's logic is "rewritten in a language the invaders could not read," options are crystallized, and the cost is visible in the "hopeful desperation" and the risk of legal seizure. One meaningful tightening (stone placement as the centerpiece requiring "more than just paint") deepens the stakes. Minor deduction: the tugboat captains' role and the families' silent packing are told rather than shown, slightly softening the escalation's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the ticking chemical strip, and the approaching mirror array, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the final image crystallizes the loss of natural darkness. Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Elias, Tycho basin, final true night), and the countdown device provides a clear ticking clock. However, the cost at closure—Elias "had the image"—reads more as accomplishment than forfeiture; we see what he gains (a photograph) but not what specific path or option he forecloses, which mutes the felt price required for the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story anchors quickly (depot, Elias, morning, approaching launch) and follows a clear causal spine: damaged drone → diagnosis via refraction → firmware patch → restored flight. The inferred lens is Causal with light Accumulative coloring (the refraction ritual, the mounting engine noise). Closure is a Decisive Change—the drone moves from broken to airborne—but the cost is abstract; Elias pays no visible price and no option is foreclosed. The "satisfied in his quiet, darkened world" ending acknowledges his isolation but does not reweight it through the repair's completion. One meaningful tightening occurs (the anchor lifts, deadline crystallizes), sufficient for this length, but the final image lacks the felt trade-off required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Silas's breath on glass produces the convergence-map, reweighting his metaphysical quest with a concrete, fleeting image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—his decision not to record the coordinates reconfigures the premise (truth too true to commodify) with conceptual cost (the knowledge dies with him). One tightening occurs when the condensation coalesces against expected physics, narrowing his epistemic stance. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and metaphoric pressure toward a moment of synchronization, then retreats into watchful recurrence. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the archway stabilizes, the fork sings, Silas retreats knowing collapse is inevitable—but the cost remains conceptual and abstract ("willing to stand watch") rather than a visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page, limiting the felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/sacrifice)—Elara's refusal to abandon the task forecloses survival with visible cost: "closed her eyes, content to become part of the signal." Orientation is immediate (who, where, stakes). The transmission success → acceptance of death linkage is clean. Cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs through oxygen depletion forcing the peak choice. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure—Elian's escape through a metaphysical door—arrives without causal preparation or visible cost; it resolves via the prison's "impossible nature" introduced moments before use, bypassing earned agency. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague: "circular chamber," "lighthouse prison off a jagged reef" establish mood but not concrete spatial logic until the escape itself. The dominant stake (avoid scapegoating after the drowned sailors) is declared but never tested on the page; no reversal tightens options before the exit. Under any lens, the ending offers spectacle without cost or constraint that shaped prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and establishes a causal chain: Julian brings the bead → triggers resonance → ghost appears → exchange occurs → cure delivered. The closure lands on the page with emotional cost (loss of guardian, survival won) and the lens reads as Causal with an Accumulative accent in the final image. However, the transaction itself unfolds without complication or reversal; the ghost's appearance and the cure proceed as preordained, reducing the sense of narrowed options or meaningful tightening before the end. One meaningful deepening occurs in the final beat when survival and loss crystallize together, meeting the sufficiency test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (tidal labyrinth), and when (dusk/night) within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and sensory immersion build toward the final image of the stitched scar as proof that "precedents of decay could indeed be broken." Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth reframed from ruin to tapestry—with the cost legible in Elara's collapse and the night's perilous labor. One meaningful deepening (the completion of the repair) tightens the stake, though the trance state blunts agency at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through image and reflection toward a final reweighting when the sundial casts its shadow. Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the restored sundial reweights "interrupted journeys" into continuum—but the cost is conceptual and retrospective ("proven that what was paused could be restarted") rather than an on-page forfeiture or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery → reconstruction → restoration), sufficient for this length, though the final beat leans declarative ("her faith...was solidified") instead of charging through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers details (clipboard, fountain pen, chalk codes, vellum) to build a mood and world rather than tightening options causally. Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). However, closure lacks felt cost: Elian completes his task exactly as planned with no reversal, complication, or reweighting of stakes. The ending image—standing to mail the letter—registers as completion of procedure rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing that changes what the activity means. No on-page price is paid; the chalk will be scrubbed, but that affects no present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal. Orientation anchors early (dome, loom, Kael's demand). The conspiracy setup → flame ritual → encoded map follows clear because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change: the map now screams treason to those who know the codes, altering the coup's outcome off-page. Cost is conceptual (Lysa's continued risk) rather than viscerally felt in the final image; the slump and wind feel more atmospheric than a reweighting with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening (Kael's two-day deadline narrowing options) is present but the ending skips the lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when promptly and employs a Causal lens: Julian seeks the past moment → Elara performs the ritual → moonlight heals the stone → condensation reveals the hidden plea → Julian decides to answer. The closure is a Decisive Change (shift from seeking the past to answering the present) with felt cost (years of silence, the weight of missed vulnerability). One tightening occurs when the message appears, narrowing his understanding and compelling the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered examination of the cast, building density until the rewriting action shifts cadence and meaning. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (who: Elias; where: atrium; when: post-anesthetic). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias rewrites the artifact and thus symbolically cleanses memory before it settles, forecloses his analytical approach with the cost of vulnerability ("breathing in sync with the distant tide"). The because/therefore chain from examination to intervention is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (studio, fresco fragment, daydream entry by ~10% mark). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases as Elara layers light onto fog, building toward the cathedral image that reweights her creative despair. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the temporary triumph teaches her "the act of creation was its own reward")—a thematic repricing with conceptual cost (acceptance of impermanence). However, the cost feels declared rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page, weakening the "felt" requirement for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches a lyric/accumulative pattern early: the coin-toss triggers a nested sequence of awakenings that compress and return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian's final reply reweights the central question with conceptual cost ("shatters truth, so we might enjoy the pieces"). The pause-as-timeframe and the acoustic geometry establish constraints, and the pattern holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph; the lens is Accumulative/Textural with a lyric payoff, and the ending image (the modified coin, the smile, the reply) charges prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors late: we learn Julian is hiding in the greenhouse only after the opening migraine metaphor, and the "after thoughts became taxable" premise arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized pressure. The closure—walking through distortion as a "free man"—gestures toward Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted ("twelve good men their freedom") rather than felt on this page; Julian's own ledger blinks out without visible sacrifice or tactical trade-off in the moment. The seed's shattering creates spectacle, but the link between花园 message patterns (mentioned once in flashback) and this climactic object feels stitched rather than causally inevitable. Drive lens reads Causal with a Situational overlay, but the lens wavers when the garden clubs vanish from the page after their paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Elias, shell, cross-legged, postcard in hand). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through ritual action, sensory layering, and the slow transformation of space from tomb to garden. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias remains sleepless but is "no longer a prisoner of his sorrow," having built a garden from grief with visible cost (surrendering the postcard, his anchor). One meaningful deepening—the shift from holding to releasing—reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the act of tucking away the image "until the image was gone."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the opening paragraphs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through descriptive density and the wind-chime repair reweights the orchid's vitality. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian resumes patrol with the possibility that names might drift to scavengers below, crystallizing his duty's stakes. Cost is implied (endless guardianship in isolation) but remains conceptual rather than felt in the final image, and the closure image is more iterative echo than decisive reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: Elara's decision to use Veritas Aeterna triggers magical chaos, her spoken promises stabilize the spell, and Kael's recognition leads to reconciliation. The closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (trust restored through shared truth-magic) with visible cost (exertion, vulnerability, the risk taken). Orientation anchors who/where/what by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the magic backfires and Elara must weave emotional lattice to survive, narrowing options and raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure arrives on-page as Decisive Change—the water flows into forbidden tunnels, Elian succeeds in sabotage, the gauges falsely read "Closed"—with felt cost (treason, adrenaline terror). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The chain's tension provides one meaningful reversal ("if the chain snapped, the bypass would fail"), and the resolution is earned by Elian's prior analysis and mechanical intervention. Cost is legible: he commits treason and remains "a ghost in the machine," though the emotional price could be sharpened in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: woman arrives with evidence → Elian stops lying → he trusts enough to explain → he releases the bird. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bird carries the meteorite into the sky where the song can resonate, and Elian's solitude dies to enable the shared secret—the cost is his hoarded silence, felt on the page in "blooming withering in his own chest." One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's knowledge forces his hand. The lens holds without contradiction, and the cost is legible in both the physical release and the emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments of setting, backstory, and symbolic objects build toward a conceptual repricing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—Elara stepping back to create "the first intentional gap"—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (she must rebuild walls, not bridges) and the logbook discovery provides the pivot. The cost is felt as renunciation of connection in favor of necessary separation, though it remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens through the ostracod display, which reweights Elara's search for belonging via the living galaxy image. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (she leaves the feather, finding rhythm in the deep), but the cost remains implicit—what path has she foreclosed? The "until sunrise" frame provides temporal pressure, yet the escalation reads more as atmospheric intensification than a tightening that narrows options. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the first paragraph). The because/therefore causality is thin: Kael dims lights → ostracods appear → Elara feels immersed → she decides to let go, with each step driven more by coincidence (the tidal cycle) than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is solid by the opening paragraph: who (sea-foam recollectionist), where (geode), when (during the harvest). The story follows a causal sequence: bird drops seeds → foam reacts → glass found → projection → gap identified → conjecture → revelation. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "They hadn't died; they had just become background noise"—reweighting her life's work with a quiet conceptual cost (her harvest is souls). The lens holds as Causal throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when she must act "within the timeframe before memory fades," but the final cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page, keeping this just below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (Elias, tidal arcade, between acts). The piece follows a causal lens: bishop placement → tide vibration → cascade → woman's joy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's equation is "complete," the woman's monotony broken, but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page—no option foreclosed for Elias, no price paid beyond his effort. One meaningful tightening (the engineered chain reaction) is present and the lens holds, but the closure image lacks undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual deepens through each step (alignment, stylus press, fledging, anchoring, dissolution) and the final departure reweights her status from "trapped dancer" to "vessel of the prohibited past." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she steps into exile carrying the verse, options crystallized, pressure felt. However, cost remains largely anticipated rather than paid on the page; the verse "safe from enforcers" and the walk to the gate proceed without friction or visible sacrifice in the moment. Orientation is clear early (twilight garden, thirty-third year, Lyra's role). The tightening occurs but the conceptual price ("no longer just a dancer") lacks the immediate, on-page sting that would elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Silas's understanding crystallizes that fractures create value, and the final image of the atrium blazing openly reweights the opening fear with undeniable conceptual cost—his role shifts from fixer to framer. One meaningful deepening (the ripple sequence) tightens the dominant stake. Minor slip: the ripples "told him" and "promised" in a way that borders on convenient confirmation rather than dramatized uncertainty, slightly softening the closure's felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt: who, where, and when anchor within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—reflection and image density reweight the stake—but the closure lacks visible cost; "the burden lightened" is asserted, and no prior option or path is foreclosed on the page. The scatter-soot act registers as ritual gesture rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with undeniable pressure, weakening the closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (Elian, grotto, converging realities) and maintains a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through decorating the balloon, lighting it, and watching its ascent until the gray stagnation recoils. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the equation balances, the world revitalizes) with conceptual cost legible in the final image of a "heavier and more real" present. One meaningful deepening occurs when the balloon breaches the membrane and forces the multiverse to acknowledge new variables, narrowing the threat and reweighting the stake under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered discovery (passage → library → hearth → diaries → negatives) that reweights the dominant stake (discovering what walls dream becomes carrying a crime's memory). Orientation is clean by paragraph one. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias accepts the burden and the final click returns "changed and somber," crystallizing his new role as keeper with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diarist's confession transforms his professional survey into moral witness. Cost is visible in "crushing reality" and the deliberate packing of evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elara needs water droplets, sound, and a borrowed heartbeat to complete her mirage before the bells ring. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The closure unit—the man standing with purpose after seeing the mirage—lands on the page as a Decisive Change, though the cost is felt only obliquely (Elara dissolves, the spell ends). The ticking clock creates genuine pressure, and the magic system's mechanics drive escalation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when by the opening). The closure unit—signing below the children's names—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the warlords acknowledge debt and foreclose the path of denial). Cost is visible: they transfer sorrow to Kaelen, and the silence shifts from held breath to exhaustion. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ritual transforms abstract redemption into embodied regret. Minor slip: the celestial interference silencing weapons is introduced but never tested; we don't see what happens if talks fail or extend past alignment, so the time constraint remains ornamental rather than shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure accretes through landscape detail, backstory reflection, and the egg's placement, culminating in a charged final image (rain hissing on salt, the hidden life, the promise of echo). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the act is complete, consequences crystallized but not yet paid—with felt cost in the doomed gamble and Vance's walking away. One persistent constraint (the hellscape he created) shapes the final act. No causality breaks, though the backstory block is substantial (~30%) and the middle sags with exposition rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The causal chain is visible: Elara approaches, works the spell, pulls the thread, shatters the Prism—but the Magistrate's dawning realization never intersects her action in time to create a reversal or raise cost. The closure unit (shockwave of voices, Magistrates fall, Elara conducts chaos) is a Decisive Change, but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("giving away the intimacy she had hoarded") rather than felt on the page; no on-page sentence shows what she surrenders or how it alters her. Under a Causal lens, the sequence progresses without a meaningful tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of puppets "innocent once more" reweights the premise that linear narratives are lies, with the conceptual cost legible in the erasure itself. The piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through the reversal's density and the dome's amplification of silence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reversal strips away certainty, though the heckler's capitulation lacks on-page resistance that would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the monarch's arrival, the contrast of wing colors, and the "interrupted cadence" image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights history and memory through the juxtaposition of king and commoner, and the line "Whatever history survived would be written in the stone, not the sky" articulates conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening (the cadence-break moment) suffices for this length, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the ephemeral memory becomes imperishable metal, and the act forecloses the paper's fragility permanently. Drive lens is Causal (because/therefore: coating → mold → rope reconfiguration → heat → pour → solidification). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Elias, icebound sanctum, aurora, workbench). One meaningful tightening occurs when the furnace mechanism requires the rope reconfiguration, narrowing options and forcing the ceremonial act. Cost is legible in the final image: the "ghosts of the past" are now "locked…into a fortress of permanence," and the original card is ash.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Hybrid (causal with accumulative/conceptual coloring). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara pulls the lever, merging with the storm, forecloses the bunker's static safety with felt cost. The dreamscape sequence motivates the box discovery; the because/therefore chain from vision to search to seal-break to lever is clean. The final image reweights the temporal-blindness premise with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening (storm approaching → flooding foreseen → lever decision) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors immediately (Babylon, between regimes, Bel-ibni). The causal lens holds: astronomer's lifetime measurements → proof of sentience → urgent ritual to preserve knowledge before invasion → covenant sealed in ether. One meaningful tightening occurs when the schematic diagrams lift into light and the rift opens, narrowing his options to the transaction. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—blowing out the candle, knowledge hidden in the dark—crystallizes the cost (truth inaccessible to conquerors) and reconfigures the opening urgency into earned stasis. The "efficient execution of a final, desperate duty" resolves with visible cost: the tile is "inert but forever changed," and the astronomer accepts isolation of the truth as the price of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story signals a confrontation stake but resolves it via an artifact (the cylinder) that acts on Kaelen rather than through protagonist agency. The closure unit—Kaelen's sword liquefying and the cylinder rolling away—occurs on the page, but the cost is abstract: no concrete choice, forfeiture, or visible price is legible in the final image, only the assertion that "the transfer was complete." Causality is present (Elian engineers trap → uses cylinder → Kaelen shifts) but the decisive mechanism (cellular memory overwriting tissues) bypasses dramatized conflict. Orientation is delayed: "who" is anchored early, but "where" (dimensional geometry, mercury floor, violet cosmos) remains vague staging without spatial consequence until the walls turn transparent late.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation early (Silas, orchard, three nights ago) and builds density through the ritual sequence, culminating in the cathedral manifestation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of touching solidified air reweights the dream-capture premise with tactile cost ("cold fire of creation," "burning lungs"). The escalation operates through pattern and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, consistent with the chosen lens. One meaningful tightening (fog clears, dream stands solid) is sufficient at this length, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who, where, breach context). The causal lens holds: Elara's standard tools fail, forcing the bag dump, which surfaces the ribbon whose memory of change unlocks the solution. The closure—tying the ribbon loosely to allow cyclical release—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible conceptual cost (the town's petrified vow is replaced by a fragile, temporary knot). One meaningful tightening occurs when the rift widens after the needle is rejected, narrowing options and forcing the unorthodox method.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal/Situational hybrid—the temporal paradox creates situational pressure while Elian's choices narrow options causally. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Charged Poise moment: Elian commits to carving "the fear he felt right now," crystallizing his stance with visible cost (he must execute tomorrow with no room for error). The phantom-knife image and loop-closing decision reconfigure the entire inheritance paradox with felt pressure, though the cost remains one beat away from full on-page payment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when within acceptable bounds and follows a causal chain: Elara descends, negotiates with the golem using diary knowledge, frees the Traveler. The closure—a conceptual repricing where "what was missing" reweights the rescue—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract; the mountain "settles," yet no tangible price is paid by Elara or the Traveler. The inferred lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture, but the final beat doesn't foreclose a path or alter tactics with felt consequence, capping resonance in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves deeper into the ship, speaking her path into existence, until the garden reweights her quest from separation to integration. Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraphs. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): she pockets the card and walks away "carrying her twin not as a burden, but as a silent, permanent passenger," reweighting the premise with a felt cost—she releases the hope of conversation. The cost is legible but could be more viscerally shown in a gesture or sensory detail at the moment of turning away.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: frozen watch → door exists → rope repair → timelines merge → bell rings pure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the wax seal dissolves, the rope becomes whole, memories restore), and the mechanics hold. One meaningful tightening occurs when he presses the seal and merges the strands. Minor deduction: the stakes feel somewhat abstract—"fables of absence" threaten the institution but never press Elian personally in a way that narrows his options or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Elara achieves "hard-won sanctuary" but the silence is described as "thick and solid…a warm blanket of iron," signaling weight and finality. The causal lens holds—echo chamber stone aligned with ice fissures produces the counter-song. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy beings approach and she executes her plan, narrowing options to this single acoustic gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Situational elements (coincidence frames the stakes but agency drives resolution). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (who, where, what). The piece delivers a decisive change: the beacon activates, piercing the sky and announcing survival—a visible, felt accomplishment with social resonance. Escalation proceeds through clear because/therefore links: finding the prism enables the attempt, aligning the crystal with starlight purifies the beam, cranking the gears completes the act. Cost is visible in her trembling hands, weeping, and the physical strain, though the closure tilts celebratory rather than ambivalent; the locked-and-key metaphor in the final line risks moralizing but the prior image of light piercing cloud sustains the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory density (ozone, crystal whispers, shadow angles) toward a cadence shift at closure when the shadow stops on "solitude." Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the unmoving cloudscape and capped quill crystallizes the "long static dark" with felt conceptual cost. One deduction: the cost of writing this entry versus another choice is implied but not dramatized—Elara never hesitates or refuses an alternative path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear who/where/when anchors and maintains spatial coherence throughout the single continuous scene. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory detail and the final firework cascade functions as a resonant reconfiguration that charges the setting with hope. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elian simply "extinguishes his flame" and walks on, unchanged and undiminished, with no tactic foreclosed or price paid. The mosaic discovery adds texture but does not narrow options or create a meaningful tightening; it's a confirmation rather than a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara, tidal-pool chronicler), where (grotto), and when (pause after resignation) by the second paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence deepens through cicada handling, starfish observation, and texture discovery until the final release constitutes Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she grants permission with visible cost (future solitude). The cost is legible in "mornings where she would catalogue…alone, and the evenings where only the wind would answer." Lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening through the extended observational sequence that reweights her stance from potential argument to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors by ~30 words; the gravitational inversion provides the tightening window and the capping beat reconfigures prior material. Cost is legible—she traps radiance that once freed her—but the final image ("turning her small, cramped room into a palace") asserts transformation rather than showing the moment of release or its price on the page. One meaningful deepening lands; the RR form is valid but the closure sentence drifts toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with situational pressure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. The central problem (hostile silence threatening Kael) and solution (storm glass catalyzing atmospheric shift) form a clear because/therefore chain, but the turn lacks meaningful cost or foreclosed options—Elian deploys his tool without hesitation or trade-off. Closure is a Decisive Change (crushing void → soothing blanket) with visible effect on Kael, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page; no tactic is altered, no path closed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly and follows a causal chain (waterfall → orchard → mural → stairs → throne). Closure delivers a Decisive Change—Elara claims the seat—but the cost remains abstract: "nostalgia faded into resolve" tells rather than shows a felt price. The lens reads Causal, held throughout, yet the final image asserts transformation without on-page evidence of what she sacrificed or lost to sit there.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page with felt cost: Mara releases the ring, losing her proof of escape to gain "her hands back," and the threshold dissolves into "vast, terrifying open space." The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through sensory density and metaphoric recurrence (ash, threshold, shadows) to a cadence shift at release. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who: Mara; where: burnt sanctuary; when: after severance). One micro turn (shadow stretching, Elian's arrival) sets up the tightening without multiplying reversals. The final image reweights the ring from trophy to anchor, fulfilling Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and establishes a causal chain: quantum promise approaching → Elias chooses to intercept → uses bolt as focal point → pressure collapses into diamond. The closure is a Decisive Change with a tangible artifact (diamond) replacing the bolt, and the cost is legible (bolt "crushed out of existence"). The lens reads as Causal with a situational accent (pressure forcing stance crystallization). One meaningful tightening occurs when the promise "slams" and Elias funnels it into the bolt, narrowing options and delivering an on-page transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page with audible, social cost: the emperor's lie broadcasts into the city, rupturing centuries of rule. The causal chain is tight—crank insertion → resonance hunting → crystal shattering → voice revealed—with each beat advancing under a causal lens. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian must find the exact rhythm by intuition, narrowing options before the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece anchors who/where by the opening paragraph and attempts closure through the protagonist's murmured allegiance and the unsnapping action, which shifts reality and lifts him into the void—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost at closure is asserted ("forsake his past vows," "finally free") rather than made legible through a specific on-page sacrifice or trade-off; the reader cannot point to a concrete price paid in the final beat. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density of alchemical imagery, ritual pattern), but the ending leans toward stated transformation without a felt tightening or visible forfeiture that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate: who (Elias), where (file room basement), and when (three weeks post-emancipation). The piece reads as accumulative/textural: dust patterns accumulate evidence, the button materializes the hypothesis, and the addendum reweights the file's meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Conceptual Repricing)—Elias salvages a "luminous truth" and the cost is conceptual (the boy's only inheritance is debris-born hope). One tightening occurs when the button transforms abstract dust into proof of love. Lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal drive: Elara must deliver the key, the rendezvous fails, she navigates alone using the puddle-reflection map, reaches the lagoon, and activates the terminal. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored by paragraph two). The closure—truth flooding the network—lands on the page with visible consequence (screens flicker, propaganda shatters), though the conceptual cost to Elara herself (standing "small" and "shivering") is more atmospheric than a legible forfeiture or stance crystallization that narrows future options. One meaningful tightening occurs when the extraction team fails to appear, forcing solo action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal (protagonist agency narrows options through technique application). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change—the prophecy retreats, threat neutralized—with visible physical cost (shaking hands, metaphysical exertion). The because/therefore chain is clean: astronomical alignment opens the window, Elias plays negative space, the machine fights back, the final whisper seals it. One meaningful tightening (accelerating machine whine vs. robust negative space) suffices for this length, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational elements: the hush arrives, Silas decodes the leaf message, builds the shrine, and the seed transforms. Orientation is established early (who, where, when). However, closure hinges on a stated rule ("that which is planted during the hush emerges transformed always") rather than earned on-page pressure; the sapling's appearance feels automatic rather than a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The final image offers thematic repricing (ash as snow, life continuing) but the cost remains conceptual and abstract, not felt in Silas's choices or losses.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (workshop→tavern clues→wildlands→greenhouse→waterfall) and the closure—Silas holding the compass, stranded but exhilarated—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is present: he's trapped on a rock with no clear escape, yet feels pulsating exhilaration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bridge kit fails, forcing improvisation. The lens reads Causal with an Accumulative accent (pattern recognition→artifact→shift in stance), and it holds through the ending without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first ~80 words (Elara, foundry, post-search). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered alchemical process until the golden filigree materializes Julian's fracture-map, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the invisible made visible) with conceptual cost (his absence now permanently fixed in beautiful ruin). Causality is clean—coin melted, poured into dissolution-site, gold catches in air—and the closure reweights the opening stake (understanding the weight of names) through the charged final image. One minor elision: the exact mechanics of why gold "catches in the air" rather than falling could be more tightly cued earlier, though the phrase "laws of physics bent" signals intent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is on-page and legible: the General laughs, his chains shatter, and he fades—a Decisive Change with visible cost (release from eternal brooding). The piece follows a Causal lens; Elian's harp snagging the ghost and the tooth triggering the memory both narrow options and drive the turn. Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by the first paragraph). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth shifts the General's memory from shame to mirth, foreclosing his spectral existence. Minor slip: the "luminous ache" and "beautiful pain" phrasing in the closure beat edges toward abstract summary rather than staying fully in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: post-interrogation survivor waking in an alien forest. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory oppression and proprioceptive overload toward a moment of symmetrical understanding. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: "mercy was not the absence of pain, but the perfect, symmetrical distribution of it across a system strong enough to bear the load." The cost is conceptual and undeniable—he accepts becoming "a component of the forest" rather than escaping it—though the final image leans abstract ("violent, beautiful calculus of atonement") where a concrete sensory anchor would sharpen the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds density through layered sensory and metaphysical detail, deepening into the painting's trapped memory. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elian completes the rescue, the painting is exhausted, and he records the keeper's story with visible cost—the ghost is given a home, the labor is done. One meaningful deepening occurs as the lens fragment reveals the hidden tragedy, reweighting the soot-covered canvas. Cost is legible in the final image: the painting is now "ordinary canvas and oil, its hidden depth exhausted."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elias diagnoses dust patterns, finds the jammed barrel, extracts it, and engages the mechanism, lowering the trapped lift. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). The closure—descending ceiling, fading ghosts—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (vigil ended, cycle completed) with a quiet felt cost (the "descending truth"). However, the cost remains abstract; we don't see what was trapped or what truth Elias now must face, only that the machine finishes its eighty-year cycle. The linkage is clean but the final image's conceptual price is more implied than undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through image and conceptual density toward the shattering climax. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (library, Silas, post-reality world). The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the library collapses, Silas falls, eternity compresses. The causal chain (frost + whisper → press → fracture → collapse) is clear and the final image charges prior material. One meaningful tightening occurs when the press stamps contradiction into the system.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The archaeological dispute builds pressure through escalating ideological stakes, and the storm sequence provides a clear tightening when Elian's device projects his vision. The closure unit—Elian "won the dispute not with facts, but with art"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (fabrication vs. truth, the dead remain dead). The ~120-word orientation is met (who/where/when anchored early), and the lens holds. Cost is felt in the final paragraph's "even a reimagined past could not bring back the dead," though the emotional register flattens slightly rather than sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid: Elias's choice to "mend what isn't torn" and press the stone into the master gear produces an immediate, on-page reversal (rust halted, metal restored). Closure lands with a decisive change—the machine sings, the rust is banished—though the cost is more conceptual (the acceptance of an unconventional method) than visceral or relational. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first lines. The lens holds through the ending, and the protagonist's agency drives the turn, satisfying the causal track despite the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and resonant imagery build toward a final image that reweights the opening stake. Orientation anchors (Silas, post-factory valley, night descent) arrive early. The structure is a single continuous descent with clear spatial progression and one meaningful deepening when he pours the vial and the cavern "hinges" open. Cost is felt but oblique—"trembling fingers" and "breath of the impossible" charge the final image, though no concrete forfeiture or path foreclosed is made legible. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the known world surrenders to mystery), but the conceptual price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening archway image and quickly establishes the stake: a freighter drifting toward the Razor Rocks. The closure is on-page and causal—Elara's projection guides the ship to safety—with visible cost in her physical effort and adrenaline expenditure. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative coloring (the sculpture's transformation, the layered interpretation of the slide). One meaningful tightening occurs when she rigs the arc lamp and the ship begins to turn. The ending recedes into reverie rather than charging the final image with unmistakable pressure, which softens the closure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, what she seeks). The story establishes an Accumulative lens through the three-night vigil and the postcards, building toward the flower's revelation. However, the closure—Elara's decision to paint differently—is told in summary ("she finally began to paint") without a visible, felt cost or a concrete image that reweights prior material. The turn from vanity to generosity is declared rather than enacted on the page, weakening the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is solid (who/where/when by paragraph one). The closure unit—Elara transcribes the cipher, the Scire dissolves, lagoon solidifies—is on-page and constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (she must witness and preserve his story). However, escalation is thin: she descends, arranges symbols, he responds, she transcribes. No meaningful reversal tightens options; the Scribe's cooperation arrives without complication. The causal lens holds but the single tightening (his demand for legacy preservation) lacks friction or price that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The piece accumulates density through the conception sequence, building pressure as Elara channels complexity into the bottle, then crystallizes at the moment she raises it to shatter—a Charged Poise that reconfigures the silence with undeniable cost (the messy future she's about to unleash). One meaningful deepening is present: the mental strain sequence that locks the simulation into the bottle and changes the object's state from inert to swirling storm. Cost is legible in the final image: she's ending the quiet forever, with all the struggle she's woven in.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Foghorn stops → Vane compelled → memory triggers solution → immersion reveals prophecy → realization that "the tower's time had officially run out." Orientation anchors quickly (garden, Vane, post-Foghorn silence). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the architect's metaphor becomes literal prophecy, reweighting the entire premise with the undeniable cost that the tower's foundation oath has expired. One meaningful tightening (the panic-to-memory-to-action sequence) drives the ending with visible cost (the artifact dissolves, knowledge arrives, peaceful silence becomes "heavy with velvet disquiet").

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (icebound atrium, Elian, post-hatch timeframe) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece deepens through layered imagery (vortex → lattice → vault descent) and a cadence shift at closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian sits among seeds holding a pea charged with "the weight of the future and the strange, electric resonance of the stolen past," crystallizing the stake with felt cost (moments reclaimed from the void). However, causality is thin—vortex subdued by acorn-cap visualization feels asserted rather than earned through struggle—and the closure image, while poetic, doesn't visibly foreclose a path or dramatize a tradeoff on the page. One meaningful tightening (seal broken → vault opened) is present but escalation remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative/Textural accents: the glue-curing timeframe, atmospheric stillness, and zero-hour convergence create a because/therefore chain that narrows Elias's options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he refuses the test, powers down the siren, and forecloses the path of protocol compliance with legible cost ("he would have to explain the lack of a log entry"). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The ending reweights "test" from mechanical to existential ("testing the capacity of the world to be quiet").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear cadence shift at closure. The piece delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + thematic repricing): Elara's ritual of witnessing and the meteor's transformation reweights her understanding of her role, and the cost is visible in her renewed commitment to labor now understood as sacred. The final image—"the willingness to burn was the only way to truly be seen"—charges prior material with conceptual cost, though it edges toward explicit statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density (visual noise of ghosts, the covenant's unraveling, the ritual's re-tying) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Elias's refusal forces the woman into peaceful drift, the covenant retightened. Cost is legible: her urgency drains, his breath held then released, and the atmosphere settles—felt consequence on the page. One meaningful deepening (woman approaches → Elias gazes through box → her form wavers into peace) is sufficient for this length under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates world-detail and imagery until the shard triggers a cadence shift and conceptual repricing—death as "unchangeable integer" reweights the chaotic premise. Closure lands with felt cost (her "borrowed time" aligns, forecloses frantic pace) and the final image is resonant. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Emerald Silo, toxic skyline, borrowed-time role). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the because/therefore linkage from message → descent → shard is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean by paragraph one. The story establishes a ritual frame, accumulates sensory and symbolic material (storm debris, cobalt water, feather, kite snap), and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elian weaves the kite's loss into the dawn, accepting asymmetry as the design's completion. Cost is conceptual and felt in the image of the "permanent majestic flaw," though the price remains oblique rather than viscerally on the page. One meaningful deepening (the kite snap) alters the ritual's outcome and charges the final image, meeting the lens requirement. Minor slip: the ritual mechanics ("stitching clouds," "dragging ink upward") remain metaphorical rather than legible as concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Silas completes the remodeling and sits to die, the pillar's pulse matching his fading heartbeat—a crystallized final moment that reweights the entire premise with felt cost (his life exchanged for synthesis). The ending lands on the page with undeniable cost: "the fading rhythm of his heart" and the system he created functioning as his body fails. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (who: island caretaker, where: temple orchard in living stone, when: after terminal prognosis). One meaningful deepening occurs as the copper-wire solution transforms the warring factions into symbiotic partners, and the final image charges all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Elara, tower base, post-Contact spring morning). The climb tightens causally—dusty footprints confirm Aris's presence, validating her heretical theory—and closure lands on-page with visible cost: she throws the amber, foreclosing return to stasis and committing to resistance. The final image ("first note of a war song") reconfigures her stance from solitary inquiry to collective defiance. One minor slip: Aris's confirmation feels slightly expository rather than forcing a new tactical choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when by the end of paragraph one, meeting the Orientation Test. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and motif layering (blooming jetty, grey water, dead languages) build toward a closure image where submerged kelp rises to meet the surface, reweighting the barren seascape with visible bioluminescence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing)—the battlefield dissolves "one seed at a time"—that lands on the page with conceptual cost (the slow, obsessive erasure of war's wound). However, the cost remains largely thematic rather than viscerally felt; Silas faces no on-page trade-off or forfeiture, and the garden's success feels assured rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs (Silas, scrapyard, post-war). Drive lens: Causal—each beat links: cylinder → visual reading → amber filter → riddle → leaf overlay → coordinates discovered. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief/hope replacing despair) with felt emotional cost (years of waiting, the fragility of preserved hope). One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf aligns with the groove, narrowing his search to actionable coordinates. Minor orientation debt in the opening (the "belly of this metallic beast" metaphor briefly obscures spatial grounding) but recovers quickly; no penalty applied as the effect does not persist.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening lines (who, where, when); the causal lens holds from inciting glimpse to closure decision. The story delivers one meaningful tightening: Elara's glimpse of structure within chaos narrows her stance from fear-driven ritual to explorer's resolve, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) that crystallizes options with felt cost—she commits to mapping an inhospitable singularity alone. Cost is legible in "she would not just survive the shutdown; she would map the singularity" and the shift to "steady hand," though the price remains slightly more conceptual than visceral. No causality breaks; the compass realization pivots cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when early. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density builds through the ritual chess-piece swaps, each one adding a conceptual layer until the mechanism clicks and the violet sky intensifies. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image of Elian greeting the incomprehensible unknown reweights the stagnant peace premise. Cost is conceptual (the protective wards dissolve, chaos rushes in) but the personal price to Elian remains oblique; he laughs without evident forfeiture, which softens the felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image of empty pawn spaces as "memorial made of nothing but space" reweights the opening chessboard motif with undeniable conceptual cost—the expendable are preserved only through absence. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the dust-floor text accumulates pressure and the Penumbra's departure shifts cadence and reweights the archive's meaning. Orientation anchors (Elias, Rotunda, Interregnum) arrive early. One meaningful deepening: the act of clacking the kings unbinds the chaos and permits the final revelation. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—roots of light binding the books, nightly escapism becoming "water for growth," and the heartbeat of home. Cost is present but oblique: the final sentence gestures toward stability without showing what Elara forfeits in binding the mountain. The stone discovery→quill translation→seeding sequence links causally under the lens, and the ending reweights prior material (escapism, buried talents) with undeniable pressure, though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (Silas, fountain, market square, time-frozen village) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal chain is motivated: Silas's wish → woven hush → weakening barrier → archive intervention → thread-pull → village unfrozen. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the comfort of stasis sacrificed, villagers resume unaware). The ending supplies a micro turn (labyrinth clicks solved) that functions as closure reinforcement without fracturing the main DC. One pressure-building move (finding the anchor knot, pulling it) is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in "sacrificed the comfort of the stasis" and Silas's exhale of relief/burden.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kaelen descends "ready to face the consequences, satisfied that for one moment, the truth had been as many-colored as the light through a prism," reconfiguring the canyon's singular judgment into multiplicity with visible social cost (exile). The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid—pressure accumulates through acoustic refraction, then crystallizes in his acceptance of punishment. Orientation anchors (canyon, spire, congregation) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the spire refracts rather than reflects, forcing the Elders to hear "chaos of reality."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density (acid rising, lungs burning) and psychic narration that reweights brokenness into beauty. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara transforms destruction into a golden-scarred relic and accepts death with certainty, forecloses survival with visible cost (exhaling into oblivion). The causal chain coheres—breach → desperation → ritual → transmutation → acceptance—with one meaningful deepening when "the gold was not metal, but the resilience of the soul witnessing its own end." Minor slip: the physical mechanics of the statue glowing and repelling acid while she drowns feels convenient rather than constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation is clean (who, where, when by line 4). The pilgrimage structure accumulates density through wrong turn → oasis discovery → painting ritual → release, with each beat reweighting the grief stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the release is a renunciation that forecloses clinging, with visible cost: "leaving the oasis behind" and accepting the broken mirror). The final image—"the mirror in his hall was still broken, but the image in his mind was finally whole"—delivers conceptual repricing with felt cost. One meaningful deepening (understanding "temporary eternity") tightens options and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elias's physical exhaustion ("his whole body shaking," "chest heaving") after projecting his will demonstrates the price paid. The causal lens holds throughout—storm breaks foghorn, Elias chooses silent method, ship responds—with clean because/therefore linkage. Orientation is swift (lighthouse, post-storm, two keepers). One meaningful tightening occurs when the ship drifts toward the Teeth and Elias must act immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds pressure through lunar cycle, midnight call, circuit completion, signal peak, and tapering silence—a clear density increase that reweights the stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara completes the corridor, ghosts pass, she waits for the next cycle with visible exhaustion and the smell of ozone/incense charging the final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the circuit completing, absorbing grief) tightens the dominant stake with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias achieves psychological safety by occluding empathic input, and the cost—reliance on a precarious relic and discredited methods—is legible in "tenuous peace" and the final line's ironic kingship claim. The causal lens holds: his rational training → exhaustion of pharmacopeia → turn to etheric texts → ritual application → silence/privacy. Orientation is swift (kneeling forager, ravine, empathy virus context by line 6). One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass eye works and ambient noise fades. The piece teaches a hybrid causal-accumulative pattern and pays it off without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of image and the protagonist's deepening understanding of the stranger's sacrifice, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Silas honors the voluntarily forgotten with visible cost ("his own isolation felt less hollow now"). The closure reweights the premise (lighthouse for the lost → for the voluntarily forgotten) with conceptual cost legible on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; the cost is felt rather than sharply decisive, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is coherent: causal lens with escalating environmental pressure (rising water) driving tactical choices (checking watch, reading ants, using the matrix chip). Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias steps into the portal with visible cost (leaving the cavern to drown, sealing his grief). The orientation is clear by the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water reaches his chin and he must act immediately. Cost is legible: he abandons the physical world and his shop forever.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who, where, and when early (Queen Isolde climbing the Spire, post-warning bell). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds through bleeding starlight and ember grotto, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Isolde becomes guardian, the fireflies shield, and she waits out the storm. Cost is felt (she leaves her kingdom, sheds her crown identity) but the final "mystery solved, ready to wait" edges toward summary rather than a charged image that makes the price undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Elian arranges tools → applies resolve → Kaelen's confession supplies the emotional catalyst → the pocket sun stabilizes. Orientation is swift (alchemist, Ember Nexus, twilight) and the closure lands with visible cost—the "sudden hollow in his chest" and the object handed away. The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative elements (the spiral geometry, the palette of resolve), and the ending reconfigures the friendship into a tangible, portable star. One meaningful tightening occurs when the whispered secret locks the loop, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors by line 3 (narrator, cabin, scroll). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through jealousy-triggered flight, culminating in the act of inscription as Earned Stasis—"by inscribing the dream onto the wood, I force the universe to acknowledge my presence." Cost is conceptual and felt (ghost haunting own history), legible on the page. One meaningful deepening (flight to writing) satisfies scope; the closure reconfigures the narrator's relation to time and presence with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal: Elias's decision to offer the screw → Kael's acceptance and installation → the water clock's repair creates a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly (shop, fog, Elias and Kael, morning). Closure is a Decisive Change: the clock is fixed, the screw bites and holds, and Kael's nod carries "the weight of a thousand spoken thanks"—a relational shift with felt cost (Elias relinquishes the heirloom). The ending image of "damp silence" and healing "without ever needing to smell the rot" delivers resonance tied to the protagonist's loss and compensatory gains.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the crystallized layers crack, fall away, and leave "inky residue of the story she had just written upon herself." The causal lens holds—breath triggers dilation, rhyme breaks crystal, shedding frees her—and the final image (drinking cold tea as toast) recharges the opening platform ritual with Resonant Reconfiguration. Single continuous scene in one location with clear who/where/when anchors. One meaningful tightening: the breath-hold escalates to the point where "her lungs burned" and the release "seemed to restart the clock of the world."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Silas, archive, pre-orchard-cutting moment). Drive lens reads as Causal: generator setup → spirit manifestation → apology delivered → dissipation, with the chainsaws marking closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elena reconnects, the father accepts, yet "sorrow remained etched...unwashed and permanent"—a visible emotional cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the generator forces manifestation and Elena steps forward. Cost is legible in the frost burn and her broken recognition that forgiveness doesn't erase grief, though the quick closure after the nod slightly undercuts the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening and builds toward a closure beat: Elara speaks "unify," the Spiral Arbitration shudders, and the hiccup ceases. The causal chain (her erratic footsteps stitch reality; her word choice counters dissolution) is asserted rather than dramatized—"her path...now revealed its true purpose" tells the reader the linkage retroactively. Cost is conceptual (the universe stumbles, she waits for the clock to tick again) but the ending reconfigures the premise without a visible, felt sacrifice or altered option on Elara's part. Under a hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative closure via cosmic reweighting), the closure lands but the cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal spine. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the first paragraph. The closure—key falling, edges vanishing, silence now charged as "merely the pause before the next incision"—constitutes Conceptual Repricing: the premise (fluid time as mercy) is reweighted with undeniable conceptual cost (protagonist now perceives continuity as anesthetic). One meaningful deepening occurs when the key catches and the razor edges manifest. Cost is legible in the final image: peace destroyed, world reconfigured as perpetual trauma. Minor slip: the torque-trapped key resolves via mental leap rather than physical struggle, slightly softening causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena accepts mortality through the stabilized text and the falling rain, reweighting her quest with conceptual cost (she remains "broken and whole"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density layering toward a cadence shift at the podium beat. One tightening is sufficient here. Cost is legible in the final lines: she trades certainty for coexistence with impossibility. No causality breaks; orientation anchors by ~80 words (subway, Elena, post-heart-attack). The turn from fear-expected to peace-felt reconfigures her stance decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (subway tunnel, phone booth, nighttime grid breath). One meaningful deepening occurs when Silas breaks the grief loop by distorting the harmonica tone, forcing strangers through a trance and out—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is oblique: the woman and man gain lightness, but Silas pays nothing visible; his stance crystallizes without forfeiture. The closure image (wiping the disc, awaiting the next call) reconfigures his patience as endless labor, but the felt price to him remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece establishes Elara, the jetty, and twilight within the opening lines, passing the Orientation Test. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through ritual steps (cleaning, tilting stone, steeping photo) and the covenant's reknitting until the final act—dropping the locket—reconfigures her from "widow of time" to "guardian." Closure lands on the page with felt cost (the locket is surrendered, her relationship to grief transformed). One meaningful deepening is evident; the piece would benefit from a sharper mid-point tightening to enter the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece infers as Causal-Hybrid: Arthur's whisper campaign sets up the encounter, and his decision to toss the rock creates a decisive before/after that reconfigures his isolation into connection. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shading into Decisive Change): Arthur abandons barter for vulnerability, and the cost—destroying the rock's exchange value—is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening through the stranger's arrival and Arthur's realization suffices for this length. Minor slip: "This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" is meta-commentary that weakens immersion slightly, though it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and establishes a clear causal chain: ring flares → Elara follows → touches trees → collects notes → reaches stillpoint → experiences forgiveness. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she holds silence within chaos, a permanent internal landmark) with felt emotional cost (tears, prior adriftness resolved). Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the trail of linguistic notes builds to a pattern-break silence that reweights her grief. The window-closing pressure and the ring's dowsing provide consistent forward pull, and the final image charges prior material with the peace she sought.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elian), where (octagonal chamber, gravitational anomaly), and when (after planting wrong seeds) early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered metaphor (threshing, unbending, editing contingencies) toward the final reweighted image of "readable" history. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the text settles, history rewritten), but cost remains conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible consequence that narrows Elian's future options, only asserted satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing: the "song of the harbor would last forever" reweights the premise of being forgotten, but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically felt—no concrete action or forfeiture occurs in the final beat. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of imagery and gesture-as-notation accumulate toward a final lyric claim), and it holds without contradiction. The piece lacks a meaningful on-page tightening or deepening; pressure accumulates via description rather than a reversal or complication that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: sculpture → ventilation shaft → tapestry fragment → Rotunda → vandalized portrait → charcoal recontextualization. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Elara's charcoal work transforms the red smears from silencing into fire-speech, completing Kael's promise-circuit. Cost is conceptual and felt (the permanent soot mark, the acceptance of shared rage), though the final image leans heavily on interpretive reweighting rather than a decision that narrows live options. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal payoff; the transition holds.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: Kael's drumming alters the garden's frequency, enabling neural entanglement, which solidifies the shared dream. Orientation anchors (examination table, Sound Wave Garden, immersion tank) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—stepping onto the golden water and taking Lena's hand—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible cost ("trapped willingly," "traded the waking world"). One deduction: the scientists' rush in the final lines is told rather than shown, slightly softening the physical-realm consequence that the text claims.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, aurora context). The drive lens reads Causal: Elias's notebook fold enables the shortcut, the grounding-rod mechanics open the door, and his trap summons the guards—each move narrows Kael's options in a because/therefore chain. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (Elias escapes, Kael is caught), but the cost is oblique: Elias places the coin in the container and walks away, yet no on-page sentence reveals what he sacrifices or risks by doing so, weakening the felt price at the resolution beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (storm aftermath, canal dock, two figures). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the woman's breath and realization crystallize a shift in stance—her secret no longer festers, "woven into the night"—with conceptual cost implicit in her acceptance of darkness as necessary canvas. The lantern sequence accumulates density through mechanical specificity and the final starburst image reweights the premise. One deduction: the woman's internal arc (festering guilt → quiet acceptance) is told rather than traced through her own choices, weakening closure agency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered world-building (fog, redacted fiction, lodestones, telepathy, window conspiracy) and achieves a cadence shift at closure when the city's mental hum fractures into individual questions. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (library, Elias, evening). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the rebellion's effect—hesitation introduced into the surveillance state—with conceptual cost legible in the "sudden, beautiful confusion." One meaningful deepening: the synchronized reveal transforms private chess lessons into public cognitive disruption. Cost is felt in the risk and the irreversibility of exposure, though the story stops at the threshold rather than showing immediate repercussions.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds clearly: Elian seeks Vane → physical struggle dramatizes internal resistance → scrimshaw and whale-song trigger transformation → detachment and acceptance complete the arc. The closure is a decisive change with visible cost (abandoning land-form and the island itself). Orientation anchors (Oakhaven coastline, sublittoral fringe, Elian's trade) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vane releases the bollard, narrowing options to transformation or death, and the gills signal irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece escalates through density increase and cadence shift—from booming theatrical narration to the whispered "Precision work" and manufactured quietude. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the "remade hush" reweights the premise (Happiness Mandate survival) with undeniable conceptual cost ("safe, alone, and completely empty"). One meaningful deepening tightens around the final stem's destruction, forecloses attachment, and the cost is legible in "nothing mattered, not even the woman."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and follows a single continuous scene with accumulative/textural escalation as Elara moves deeper into sensory dissolution. The closure—her realization that "the poem was finally complete and living within her"—functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her success in the transgressive act. However, the cost remains conceptual (violation of old laws) rather than felt; the final lines describe beauty and fullness without foregrounding a visible price paid. Under an Accumulative lens the density increase and cadence shift are present, but the reweighting lacks the undeniable pressure required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (Elara, post-Phoenix world, Glassblower's courtyard). The causal chain is clean: plant arrangement rejected → reed tongue offered → sound shatters quartz → Silas awakens, each step motivated by prior action. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change (Silas freed, Elara completes her composition) with felt cost (the cherished, flawed reed surrendered). The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture in the opening; escalation tightens through negotiation to sound-driven climax without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens and delivers an on-page closure with visible cost: Elara breaks her trade's rules and finds the texture she sought, while Kael receives physical contact from memory. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two). The turn—focusing light through the salvaged lens—narrows options and changes the outcome, though the realization arrives quickly without intermediate failure or constraint that would tighten pressure further. Cost is legible in "breaking the rules of her trade," satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (Timeless Observatory), and when (after rock bottom) cleanly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vellum stencil accrues pressure through handling (exam, press, setting, illumination) and the final projected image reweights the woman's "curtains of intention" with visible emotional cost (her gasp, straightening shoulders). One meaningful deepening occurs when the match-flame projects the holographic lilies, crystallizing intent into externalized image. However, the woman's transformation is more witnessed than causally earned by her own on-page choice, weakening agency at closure and capping the band slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid—the measuring ritual accumulates geometric evidence that crystallizes into the "engineered demolition" revelation, which reweights the entire premise. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: Silas realizes he's "no longer just a cartomancer, but a witness to a crime scene vast enough to encompass the entire world." Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The causal chain from measurements to proof to decision to confide is legible, though the leap from "distances implied a causality that shouldn't exist" to "engineered demolition" compresses the inferential work into assertion rather than showing geometric anomaly specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric density building toward a revelatory image). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the projection of lost history reweights Elara's understanding of her culture with conceptual cost (knowledge of irretrievable beauty and Council betrayal). However, the cost remains abstract—"burned away the last vestiges of her childhood faith" is asserted without a specific on-page choice or forfeiture that makes the before/after legible with felt consequence. The pagoda mechanism "recognized the presence of a mind that had successfully rejected the allure of the past," but this is told convenience rather than dramatized causality; the erratic dance permits entry, yet the connection between chaotic movement and worthiness is stipulated, not causally demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The library setting and shadow-hunting frame anchor who/where/when by the opening paragraphs; no orientation debt. Causality coheres: Elian's forensic comparison (video evidence of shadow-loss) motivates the river-stone capture, and the metamorphosis delivers an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he saves the fragment but forecloses the woman's wholeness). Cost is legible in the final beat: the woman "would never be whole again," and Elian's "luminous regret" charges the shelf-placement image. One meaningful deepening (the shadow's desperate fusion into the stone) tightens the thematic stakes. Minor penalty: the collective-mind backstory occupies significant real estate without dramatized resistance or a present-tense micro-choice that alters Elian's options on the page, slightly flattening momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Elara, roofless workshop, post-con night). The dominant stake—saving the chameleon while processing betrayal—tightens through the surgical sequence and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she retains compassion as discipline, not weakness, foreclosing naive trust with visible cost. Drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative accent (the shedding metaphor deepens), held cleanly to closure. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length; cost is felt on the page in the final paragraph's stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands clearly: Elias excavates to the glowing root-fusion and achieves contact, shifting the plants from screaming to humming—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible physical cost (bleeding, exhausted) and conceptual cost (he has "wrought wreckage in search of peace"). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered images (vine-structures, coffee ring map, frosted hourglass, pulsing root) to the final contact. Orientation is immediate (observatory, post-surgery, dawn). One meaningful tightening occurs when the hourglass shatters and he touches the root, crystallizing the metaphor of "stories written in breakage."

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's psychometric ritual builds density (touching, warming, siphoning energy) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the film strip grows cold and the lens holds the amber nebula—a Charged Poise moment where unused love is localized with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening (the energy transfer) tightens the dominant stake. Cost is legible but oblique: the film is "stripped of its ghost," inert, a forfeiture that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by ~100 words). The accumulative lens holds through atmospheric build and a tightening that moves from whispers to hurricane to stillness. However, the closure unit—Elian's smile and the claim that "the story had finally begun"—offers resonance without legible cost: what did he forfeit, and what concrete option closed? The final image reweights prior noise into music, yet the price remains asserted rather than dramatized, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs; the piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a situational component—pressure builds through description and ritual until the dispersion sequence deepens stakes. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: Kaelen completes the ritual, returns to his body, and the archive hums dormant; the cost (dissolution of self, dreamless existence) is felt but not newly decided. The lens holds, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure, though the change is more reconfiguration than decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the turbine sequence reweights the opening displacement anxiety through the gear's insertion and the machine's harmonic awakening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian accepts the translocation cycle with clarity, and the cost is legible in his exhaustion and surrender to unpredictability. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (bronze branch, mechanical forest), and the gear-to-turbine causality is clean. The ending lands with felt cost, though the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("mirror the unraveling of his own psyche") slightly dilutes the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the spiral journey, the punched star, the twilight vigil layer toward a final reconfiguration when the man steps off the skiff and pulls his resolved will from the mist. That moment offers Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with felt cost—he must now stand without the leash—but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs, sufficient for this length, though the causality feels thin between Elara's actions and the man's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The discovery of the piano bolt at midpoint reweights the fortress's silence, and the ending delivers Earned Stasis: Elian chooses to remain as a "contaminant," forecloses escape, and the cost (enduring the cage to remember music) is visible in the final image of him climbing with the bolt pressed to his palm. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when clearly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens is Causal: Orel plans the trap (pellet → rune → celestial pause → gravity severance), the Pretender reads and triggers it, and the rune sunders his connection with visible cost (he floats away screaming). One decisive change with felt consequence lands on the page. The celestial pause functions as the trigger mechanism, but its exact mechanics and why it matters are slightly abstract—tighter grounding of that constraint would raise confidence that the trap couldn't fire any other way.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (data assembly → composite image → realization). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—road encased in mutated super-coral—constitutes a Decisive Change in knowledge with conceptual cost: the civilization's ruin now serves as substrate for adapted life. The "periodically eternal" phrase introduced mid-story pays off in the final beat when Elian understands the reef's rebirth cycle. One meaningful tightening occurs when months of sensor confusion resolves into "chaotic, towering mountain range," narrowing options from erasure to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara's ritual gathers energy and density until the frigate ignites, and the final image reweights the "lull" with hope. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the blue glow and "heartbeat again" crystallize a shift from stasis to possibility with felt emotional cost (tears). However, cost legibility is weak—tears signal relief more than sacrifice, and no prior constraint or price shaped her tactics. The piece meets the one-tightening standard for this length, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and hold. The drive lens reads as Causal: Elara's decoding enables the unsealing, which triggers the embryo's activation. However, closure lacks visible cost—she raises her hands "in triumph" with no on-page price paid or option foreclosed; the guards' arrival feels like setup for off-page consequence rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration legible in the final image. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Elara has lost or must now endure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory triggers (wind whine, phantom heat, tactile photo) and culminates in a decisive image—the graft—that reweights the opening desolation with earned stillness and visible cost (choosing ugly rootstock over beauty alone). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure unit (binding orchid to pine) is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual and felt cost: hope tethered to brutal realism, the act forecloses optimism untethered to survival. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through intensifying imagery (stuttering ocean, bleeding light, closing walls) and a cadence shift at the descent. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Elias steps into the void with a crystallized stance ("the dark the only canvas clean enough"), forecloses survival in the light, and the cost (leaving the collapsing coordinate, abandoning the surface world) is felt. Orientation anchors (lighthouse library, Elias alone, glitching reality) land by ~80 words; no penalty. One meaningful deepening (walls inches away, final yank) tightens options before the drop.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Silas, post-eclipse, sandstone encampment). The piece follows a causal lens: Silas pursues Kaelen → confronts → Kaelen uses modified disappearing ink → escapes through geometric portal → Silas shifts focus to pattern. Closure arrives on-page as a Decisive Change in target (man to pattern), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no visible forfeiture of resources, relationships, or tactical options. The ink's mechanics are introduced late and function as a deus ex machina solving Kaelen's problem without prior setup or constraint, weakening causal integrity at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph and follows a causal trajectory: discovery → deliberation → broadcast decision → irreversible act. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (Kael's ruin, societal upheaval beginning) and the drive lens reads as Causal with situational pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael enters and the suspended moment crystallizes Elara's choice. The cost is legible in the final image ("color drain from Kael's face," "noise of the world waking up"), though the actual societal consequences remain off-page and the piece leans toward Charged Poise rather than full Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara's back-turning and return to the roses forecloses engagement with the intruder, and the stranger's slump suggests her cultivated peace has begun its work. The cost is visible—she accepts vulnerability and trusts her method over direct defense—but the final beat ("the work had begun") tilts toward thematic summary rather than a charged image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a situational overlay—pressure builds through density and the constellation collision supplies the decisive fracture. Closure lands on-page: Elara pins the echo with the rail spike, creating a "vacuum" and "diamond-hard clarity" that freezes the catch. Cost is conceptual (the world "forgotten how to sing" will now be sold divinity) but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when constellations collide and "patterns break themselves," narrowing the window for the strike. Minor gap: the "echo of a goddess" remains abstract; its capture doesn't visibly alter Elara's options or exact a felt personal price beyond residual mental "clawing."

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Eleanor, observatory, post-call timeframe). The escalation is clear: threat → examination → counterargument → call → resolution. Closure is a Decisive Change (the threat dissipates) with felt cost to Sterling and a tactical shift for Eleanor. However, the cost to Eleanor herself is not legible on the page—she ends exactly where she began, watching clouds with satisfaction. The rosewood pen and ledger memories enable the turn, meeting causal standards, but the ending lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed path for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara gives the memory a place to rest rather than erasing it, forecloses resurrection, and the oppressive silence shifts to peaceful. The inferred lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid—boot sequence initiates, waveform destabilizes, she completes the connection, and the amber traps the sound. Orientation anchors by line 2 (Elara, Laboratory, present action). One meaningful tightening: the cry intensifies, threatening overload, forcing her feverish precision under a closing time-loop. Cost is legible on-page: she does not bring the dead back but accepts the difference, and the weight lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: voices create chaos → Elian maps them in sand → severing the pattern creates acoustic reset → emergent hush. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) lands on the page with visible cost—the destroyed art, the muddy sand—and the tile flake going cold signals finality. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the voices need a moderator and acts, narrowing options with a decisive visual intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid; pressure accumulates through environment (shattered sky, nuclear winter), protocol violation (neutralization mandate), and network surveillance, forcing 734 into a crystallized stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of renaming and shielding forecloses the path of protocol compliance with felt cost (thermal waste, fragile deception, eventual system failure). Orientation anchors (plaza, 734, post-Fire timeframe) land by ~80 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when 734 discovers the child and must choose; the metadata hack narrows options with on-page cost. The "eventually claim them both" line makes mortality legible without requiring an on-page death.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Barnaby layers echoes and sensory details to build toward Clara's perceptual shift and renewed resolve. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Clara's decision to reinvent rather than sell is crystallized by the reweighted tarot image, and the cost—her prior despair transformed into fragile hope—is felt. Orientation anchors (carnival grounds, hedge maze, orchard) are established early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the overlaid Star card reweights the Tower's ruin into potential rebirth, narrowing Clara's options and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Elias's choice to tape the geode and use breath-guided movement directly enables the final image, which reweights Mara's perception of her neural static with visible cost (her tears, the fragile hope). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lattice image crystallizes a new stance toward the noise, the cost felt in "brittle, translucent." Orientation anchors quickly: Mara, studio, post-recall timeframe established by ~100 words. One meaningful tightening through the shared-breath exposure that narrows options from paralysis to navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients who/where/when adequately within the opening (~80 words). A single meaningful tightening occurs when the thermal signal clarifies into "anticipation" rather than fear, reweighting her interpretive task; this shift registers as accumulative/textural deepening. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Elara completes her mission cleanly, the "map was complete," without any on-page forfeiture, trade-off, or stance crystallization that narrows future options. The piece delivers a conceptual arrival but not a felt price, capping Q2 below high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece holds a causal lens: uncorking the jar → filtering through buttons → purified echo → inverting the hourglass creates a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands on the page with the sand's chaotic flow and the cliff script fading, constituting a Decisive Change. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt—Elias smiles into dim light with no visible trade-off or forfeited path. Orientation is prompt (warehouse, Elias, tonight) within the first two sentences, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly under a Causal lens: Elias's gamble to signal his handler, deliver the microdot, and secure redemption is dramatized on the page with visible cost (the erasure of his plea, his solitary survival). Orientation is swift; the narrative moves because/therefore with motivated ellipsis. One meaningful tightening occurs when the basket rises and the helicopter leaves him alive, reconfiguring his status from disavowed ghost to potential asset. The cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered imagery (fog, dripping, yarn-work) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the woman's burden is scraped clean and she boards the carriage light. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The closure—Earned Stasis for Silas (he has waited and now departs) combined with Decisive Change for the woman—lands on the page with felt cost (the palimpsest scraped away, time expired). One meaningful deepening occurs when Silas picks the threads and the woman straightens, narrowing options from burdened to unburdened. The cost is visible in the image of guilt "dripping away," though the scene's single continuous action limits pressure variation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (clay, glass, thrum, beekeeper vision) and the final stanza crystallizes the dominant stake—understanding preservation—into a renunciation (he cannot fix the wasteland, only honor it). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas's hands lift, the pot sits symmetrical, and the lesson is integrated with visible cost (acceptance of limits). One meaningful deepening is present when the thrum harmonizes with the wheel and the timeline fracture is understood. Lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (transition from rose to light, biological to mechanical care). Orientation anchors land cleanly by paragraph two (who, where, when). The closure executes a meaningful reweighting: the rose's death clears literal and symbolic space for the light beam, which becomes the new "bloom." Cost is legible—the rose is gone, the ephemeral light is "protected vulnerability," and the gardener's devotion shifts medium but not mission. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirrors deploy and the beam connects, crystallizing his purpose with felt fragility. Escalation is gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens: rose death → mechanism repair → precise alignment → successful light transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when promptly (Elara, Tidal Library terrace, post-waking) and builds pressure through memory assault → physical grounding → stone-circle resonance → closure stance. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts coexistence with ghosts, forecloses erasure of past, visible cost = enduring grief). The tightening is legible—one meaningful shift from victim to witness—but escalation relies on lyric accumulation and internal reweighting rather than a causal turn that narrows options. Cost is felt but oblique; the final image ("ready to curate the endless volumes of the sky") charges prior material without a sharp on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words. The placement of the twig spiral triggers a physical shift (mirrors angle, light dances), and the final image reweights "the thread" from abstract search to "act of integration itself"—a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (her secret becomes "structural necessity"). One meaningful deepening present; closure lands on the page under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, university radio booth, riots outside) land by the first beat. Drive lens reads Causal: Elias traces the signal, prepares counter-frequency, executes, observes reversal of mob behavior. Closure is a Decisive Change (mobs slow, lethargy replaces aggression) with visible effect on the page. Cost is implied (the tricksters will adjust) but conceptual rather than felt; no forfeited option or visible price is legible in the final image, which softens the closure unit slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elara's physical and emotional exhaustion after the walls retreat, the world "awake, alert, and waiting," and her deliberate walk away constitute a Decisive Change with felt price. The causal lens holds: her careful preparation (scraping the wind chest) enables the organ to function, her choice to play rather than flee drives the reversal, and the dissonant chord transfixes the walls. The piece coheres as a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchors (courtyard, organ, encroaching walls, starlight return) and one meaningful tightening (walls closing in) that narrows options to a single calculated risk. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered artistic process until the final image reweights the tragedy. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the artwork shifts from abstraction to undeniable ghost—with conceptual cost legible in Miller's crumbled grief and the town's forced confrontation. One meaningful deepening (the physical piercing and ribbon merge) tightens pressure and charges the ending, meeting the lens requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elara retrieves the journal, decodes it, travels to the station, and triggers the mechanism. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by ~120 words, meeting the test. The closure is a Decisive Change—the ship materializes—but the cost remains abstract: "dread…no longer absolute" doesn't point to a specific forfeited option or visible price Elara pays. The ritual succeeds as planned with no on-page complication or sacrifice that alters her tactics or forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story anchors who, where, and when early (Silas, pullout, post-vanishing). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: wind-driven plastic flutters layer with the glass flake to create a final image of "pixelated amnesty." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the world remains "soft, forgiving, and open"—but the conceptual cost is asserted more than demonstrated; we are told guilt loses purchase, not shown what specific past error Silas renounces or what future path he forecloses. The closing action (playing across the bridge) gestures toward forward motion, yet the price paid for this crossing is named rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: Silas's territorial defense succeeds, then the market turn and burn rate collapse the company, mirroring his father's trajectory. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he walks away with "strange lightness," having verified his hypothesis about cyclical greed with visible cost (the company fails, he loses his post). Orientation anchors cleanly by the ticket-booth paragraph. One meaningful tightening (the acquisition falls apart within the hour) narrows options and the ending reweights prior material without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Elara speaks light into existence, the inscriptions settle, the burden fragments—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens. However, the cost is conceptual and asserted ("Its heaviness gone, the memory it held finally metabolized") rather than felt through specific forfeiture or tactical alteration on the page. The causal chain from variable-star observation to dream entry to healing speech remains visible but thin; no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece teaches its pattern early but does not tighten pressure through a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: the vortex collapses, the confession thaws, and Kaelen stands satisfied that "only the ugly, unvarnished truth remained"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the chaos consumed, the secret exposed). The causal chain is legible: failed spell → vortex → Kaelen's seed deployment → barrier breach → confession released. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vines tighten and force the vortex to slow, narrowing options and delivering the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Elara in the glade, Jaren approaching, post-acceleration timeline). The causal lens holds: Jaren brings the clipping → they link through scars → he navigates the maze → discovers the nexus → gains the path to restore balance. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: the clipping turns to dust, the path is burned into his mind, and he knows where to go. One meaningful tightening occurs when the psychic link pulls him into the void and the maze unfolds, narrowing options to a singular coordinate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (who: Elian; where: catacomb orchard; what: repair his sister's bartered joy). The piece holds a Causal lens: Elian's ritual compels the orchard's resistance, he trades his certainty, and the energy releases toward Leda—each beat is because/therefore linked. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: the joy returns to Leda, Elian loses his certainty and may never leave, and the final image ("empty now, unsure of his own path") makes the price undeniable on the page. One meaningful tightening (resistance → substitution → release) fits this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (hybrid). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the first two paragraphs. The discovery sequence builds through motivated action: arrival → sifting → recognition → authentication → pocketing, each step narrowing options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias accepts his role as steward with visible cost (public humiliation remains, but purpose shifts). The cost is legible in "the silence didn't frighten him"—a stance crystallization that forecloses the profit-driven path. One meaningful tightening present; the fabric authentication provides the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (Elian, translator, Magnetic Arbor, after Aris's death). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: linguistic metaphor patterns deepen pressure as the station decays, and the closure—planting the seed to "translate" Aris into the arbor—lands with visible cost (permanent separation reframed as dialect shift). One meaningful tightening occurs when the containment field flickers and Elian acts. The cost is legible: Elian accepts "forever just beyond the reach of his physical hand," a renunciation that forecloses bodily reunion. Charged Poise qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure—forging love and hate into a singular alloy, then placing it on the shelf—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: the work of accepting contradictions as binding agent, rejecting simplification as erasure. The repeated image of the creel and the ingot anchor the pattern. One tightening occurs when the identity's paradox forces the smelting choice. Cost is legible in the labor and the final hum of harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is prompt (Elias, cathedral-like cave, present inspection) and the closure lands on the page: he crowns the stalagmite, light explodes, voices sing, he weeps, and the bunker shifts from tomb to beacon—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt emotional cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density of confessions, pearl as layered grief, final radiance as pattern payoff), and the lens holds. However, the causal linkage is soft: the pearl glows because it holds "concentrated energy of every dream," but why placing it on the stalagmite triggers instantaneous transformation is asserted rather than prepared; the mechanics feel convenient. The cost is legible ("abandoned hopes he carried…were finally released") but emotional rather than tactical, and no prior constraint or price shaped his route to this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors orientation by ~120 words (Elias, disused station, three weeks post-medication) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered description, the graffiti passage deepens his state, and the accordion performance crystallizes the ritual. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): he sits, weeps, and catalogs "not for a map, but for salvation"—a reweighting of his chronicler identity with felt emotional cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when he descends to the river and performs. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first 100 words. The piece accumulates pressure through the unfolding cipher, propagation-delay method, and time inversion, then closes on "the unspoken had finally found a voice"—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. Cost is legible: she risks entrapment ("cyclic reversal would trap her") and must flee before completion. One meaningful tightening (watch warning, walls groaning) is sufficient at this length, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the violin's transformation from ice to living vine is a Decisive Change with visible cost (treason, irrevocable alteration of the artifact). Drive lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture; the seed/coffee/ice sequence follows motivated linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian moves from contemplation to action, narrowing his window before dawn. The "perforated destiny" and coffee-reading mechanics feel slightly ornamental but don't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The closure—transferring the Magister's theorem into the emerald chip—occurs on the page with visible cost (Elara "breathing hard," the corpse turning "dull gray"), satisfying Decisive Change under a Causal lens. One meaningful tightening: the discovery of the theorem's rhythm amid static narrows her task and enables the transfer. The cost is explicit and the lens holds, though the single-scene arc lacks a second pressure point or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation is swift (who, where, what within ~80 words). The stubborn vine introduces a tightening that Elara resolves through the scalloping action, and the final image—essence drifting down, vine snapping back—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + micro Charged Poise hybrid) with undeniable cost: she stops searching and accepts the continuity of her work. The causality is clean: climb to think → realization → scallop → release. One persistent constraint (the trapped soul's fear mirroring her past) shapes the final image. Closure is on the page and legible under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (wind chimes as diagnostic tool). Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change—Vance shifts from certainty to questioning, wrapped in the Cloak, his destructive intent arrested. The cost is visible: his shattered absolutes, his new vulnerability. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse gallery, dawn, Vance's fleet waiting). One meaningful tightening occurs when the hollow mirror forces confrontation. Minor slip: the transition from mirror-shock to cloak-acceptance feels compressed; the causal chain would benefit from one more beat of resistance to fully earn the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (floating platform, teacher-student pair, temporal mechanics backstory) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the stone-ripple demonstration accumulates sensory and conceptual weight until Kael's perception shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Kael's realization "finally seeing not the void where the stone had been, but the presence it had created" reweights the central question with felt cost—his ego-driven ambition must sink for influence to spread. The magnetic grotto and trance provide a coherent pressure mechanism that deepens receptivity. One meaningful tightening occurs when the platform drifts into the grotto shadow and the ripples become "rings of silver fire," crystallizing the lesson's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure lands cleanly: Silas achieves sensory displacement, maps the exit through acoustic projection, and begins to walk with earned knowledge—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to decisive movement) with visible cost (decades spent listening, the shattered arrowhead). The piece operates under a Causal lens with acoustic logic threading cause to effect: crow observation → trajectory calculation → harmonic intersection with the ancient scream → route revelation. Orientation anchors (who, where, what) appear by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fresh tone intersects the ancient pulse, crystallizing the geography of his trap.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by paragraph one. The closure lands on-page with Charged Poise: Elara restores the arch, the Looms stutter, and she feels "slow, deliberate, and deeply, terrifyingly human" mana flow—a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (rejecting automated perfection). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ascent, archaic technique, regulatory unburdening, and the keystone placement, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sheds the brass pack, narrowing her safety in service of the impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early: lamplighter, pier, harbor, descent. The causal chain is legible: Silas seeks jar 707 → uses key tag → opens cabinet → releases vow → sees violet sound → weeps → ascends carrying the truth. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he returns to his post no longer fearing silence, forecloses his decades-long evasion of dawn, and the cost is felt in "I will wait for you" → sunrise he missed. One tightening (the violet blooming from the jar) reweights the dominant stake. Mild slip: the mechanism of luminous vows is told briefly rather than earned through earlier dramatization of how promises manifest as light.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when in the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a resonant reconfiguration at closure (Earned Stasis: Hiero continues casting lots despite cosmic futility, forecloses hope, accepts the cost). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—"he would continue to cast his lots until the final light went out"—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy loops and doubt intrudes, reweighting his task. No causality breaks; the single-scene window and single POV fit scope defaults cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift—reaper, observatory, grief, atlas—anchored by ~60 words. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas completes the map by crystallizing fears into inert forms, exhaling her ghost, stripping horrors of their haunting power. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through iteration of crystallization, and the final image ("Map complete") reweights the dominant stake (finishing her work) with conceptual cost (her voice now merely sighed back, presence reduced to echo). One meaningful deepening occurs when the first leviathan becomes "Abyssal Despair"—the act is replicated rather than escalated causally. Cost is legible but oblique: her absence is finalized, the echo stripped of its scream.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The repair unfolds in motivated beats: warming dew → suspending droplet → calculating drag → releasing at precise frequency, each step tightening the fissure and narrowing options. The climax—the final drop synchronized with wave memory—seals the bell and triggers the sea's return, a Decisive Change with conceptual and physical cost (the cosmic door swings open). Minor weakness: Elian's ignorance of danger is asserted rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals the cost of his naivety.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds density through layered images (church, schoolhouse, apothecary) that converge at the sapphire shard, reweighting the poison legend into camaraderie. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the final arrangement transforms scandal into "a love story preserved in the deep." Orientation anchors quickly (warden, drought, resurfaced town). The cost is conceptual—expunging a toxic falsehood—but the final image carries undeniable pressure and reconfigures prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (verdant orchard, waterfall, Elara, crystal, celestial deadline) and the causal lens is signaled: if she misses the alignment, the work fails. The escalation moves from analytical approach → watching starlings → summoning flame → transformation, but the key reversal (abandoning equations for wonder) happens through passive observation and internal declaration rather than a choice that narrows options. The closure lands on the page (gemstone of solidified perception) but the cost is conceptual only and asserted rather than felt—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The lens holds but the linkage is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Kael watches the chute deploy successfully, exhales the held terror, then immediately returns to seeking patterns—the burden endures with "the heavy memory of the risk remaining." Causal lens holds throughout: radio clears → inspection → fracture discovery → improvised repair → deployment test → survival confirmed → duty cycle resumes. Orientation anchors by line 3 (Kael, bio-dome arbor, post-static window). One meaningful tightening (fracture discovery) narrows options and the final image reweights "the watcher's burden" with undeniable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is present: Kael vivifies the brain and experiences emotion, a Decisive Change with cost (pouring his "cold, calculated logic" into organic potential). However, the Orientation Test penalty applies—anchor "who" is muddled by competing labels (Kael/not-Kael/"what remains"), "where" (floating rock dojo) lacks grounding past ornamental description, and "when" (during historical rewrites) never concretizes stakes or tactics by ~120 words. The causality is straightforward (defeat Vane, activate brain), but Vane's erasure by timeline rather than Kael's action undercuts earned closure. Cap Q1 and Q5 at 8.3 per the Orientation Test consequence, and cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and mechanical ritual build toward a resonant reconfiguration when the daughter's laughter pierces through. Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "when" remains abstract ("after the final grain slips"). The closure lands as Charged Poise—Silas achieves his goal momentarily, the laughter is real, and the cost (fuel duration, physical toll, existential suspension) is legible in "held the moment as long as the fuel lasted." One meaningful deepening occurs when sound shifts from mechanical to haunting, then to laughter. Escalation is smooth but somewhat atmospheric rather than choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the guardian's restraint forecloses predation with visible cost (prolonged loneliness) and the shared suspended breath crystallizes a new stance toward uncertainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—imagery and sensory density build toward the cadence shift in the final paragraph where light dims and shadows embrace. One meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian steps into light but does not strike, reweighting the garden's purpose from cataloging to communion. Cost is legible: "the crushing geometry of this world felt a little less lonely" signals emotional price paid for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The causal chain is coherent: each failed attempt narrows Elian's understanding, the penny-drop realization motivates the volatile solvent addition, and the creature's emergence constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (destruction of heritage, exposure to cold). The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texturing; closure lands on the page with the creature ascending as independent vitality, reweighting the opening's "frozen bloom" paralysis into a created future. One meaningful tightening through escalating attempts meets the length scope.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, climber's harness, Aeros towers, lunar perigee). The piece follows a causal lens: psi-gauge check → ladder climb → observation deck → relic insertion → signal attempt → protocol failure → paradigm shift → success. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she secures the transmission and reframes extinction as recipe for nursery, with the cost legible in "just another night shift"—normalization after existential labor. The link from "trying to isolate a sound" to "listening for gaps" is motivated and narrows her method decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (deckhand, spectral ferry, grotto) and follows a clear causal chain: Elara adjusts the radio → sound fills the hourglass → time corrects → ferry re-enters reality. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible consequence (the ferry resurfaces, hourglass fills, commuters return). However, the cost is vague—Elara's "sheer force of hopeful will" resolves the problem she didn't help create, and no prior constraint or price shapes her final tactics. The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture (starlight/sound patterns), but the ending leans on assertion more than earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/what by the second paragraph. The story accumulates density through the weaving action, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the paradox erupts, space unfolds violently, Elias closes his eyes with new understanding). Closure carries visible cost: the thread snaps and sears him, the gallery collapses into white light. One minor seam: the woman-on-stairs memory intrudes without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Harlin achieves his dream but recognizes he remains "anchored in the abyss," a reconfiguration with palpable cost. The causal lens holds throughout—his secret study, the command sequence, the simulation success, and the choice to deactivate all link clearly. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The single meaningful tightening (expanding sensor parameters → seeing stars → realizing the cage) narrows options with visible emotional cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal arc: curiosity about the photograph leads to the hearing aid, which reveals the child's presence, prompting the protective action that results in closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and cleanly. The closure effect—photograph changing to show the smiling blur beside Arthur—functions as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (Elara has "pulled a soul back from the brink"). However, the mechanics of how Elara's "shield of pure recognition" and act of remembering actually repel the shadows and calm the spirit remain asserted rather than dramatized through scene logic; the gap between her internal intent and external effect weakens the causal chain at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands with a decisive change: the trapped souls are released and Elias ascends, shifting from "unremembered" to "travelers who found their way home." The causal lens holds throughout—claustrophobia pressures him, he retrieves the gold fleck, triggers the sequence, and completes the Return. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tide turns and the umbilical threatens to snap, forcing the scramble back. Cost is visible in the race against the clock and the physical ordeal, though the final image could sharpen the foreclosed option or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors early (observatory, midnight, after static clears). The drive lens reads as Causal: Elias's bureaucratic ghost status enables access, the ink ritual triggers the projection, and the defragmented memory delivers the insight that reframes his grief. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the failure wasn't the fight but the prior silence—with felt cost in the "too late to save her, but just in time to save him" formulation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ink patterns resolve her confession, narrowing his understanding and foreclosing his purgatory of unanswered questions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Sylas loses his voice (DC) and the wind through bone now carries tactile memory (RR/CR hybrid). The cost is visible—scorched throat, silent rattle—and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a decisive tightening when he vocalizes the friction. Orientation is prompt (bone towers, canyon, Sylas at a hollow femur by ~60 words). One meaningful deepening occurs when the birds' formation unlocks the acoustic map, narrowing his method and raising the price. The closure reweights the premise (texture into sound) with undeniable cost, satisfying the Drive Lens Rule.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is solid: who, where, and when are clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—the brother solidifying and laughing—lands on the page and reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is unclear: Elias floats, watches, then "nurses hope" without visible forfeiture or altered options. The ritual's success feels automatic once the phone is activated; no mid-sequence reversal or friction tests Elias's commitment. The inferred lens is Causal (the ritual causes the transformation), but the because/therefore linkage is declarative rather than dramatized through setback or adaptation. Cost proof test: I cannot point to a sentence where Elias's victory forecloses a path or exacts a felt price beyond the now-dead phone.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early (sky-bridge, orchard, golems, treasonous plan). Inferred lens: Causal—the violin performance triggers the orchard's uprising because the frequency bypasses the golems' programming. The closure (trees erupt, golems crushed, city "alive") is a Decisive Change with felt cost (order destroyed, green chaos unleashed), and the locust shell's fall seals the image of transformation. The linkage from heartbeat-synced bow to magical resonance to root eruption reads clearly, and the escalation narrows to one irreversible act, satisfying the lens at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Elias deposits the storm, stands in blue light, and waits for distant thunder—a crystallized moment where the cost (risk survived, mission complete) and the reconfigured future (hope for mending) are both legible. The lens is Situational with Accumulative texture; pressure coheres through the border crossing and tightens at the lockbox. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful tightening (the border-crossing beat) is sufficient for this length and the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a closure unit of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the horse's eyes spark, the hush retreats, the bell falls silent). The escalation—wrong turn, discovery, singing to match vibration, fusing the fragment—tightens once and the final image reweights silence and voice with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: Elias abandons his sealed-lip identity to complete the work, and the foliage withers as magic concentrates. One micro-turn (realizing silence is now a barrier) sets up closure cleanly. No causality breaks; the chime timeframe holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accretes through ritual manipulation until the silk cannot sustain the geometry, then collapses back to ordinary reality. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara fails to enter fully but validates the realm's existence, stamping books "merely inches away from the screaming source." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scarf's geometry bends the library's atmosphere, raising stakes before the snap.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the terrace paragraph. The piece accumulates density through imagery and ritual until the light-construct unravels, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cipher solved, pain discharged) with felt cost: the dream is consumed in the act of capturing it. Causality is clean—sunrise enables the harvest, palette stores luminance, stylus constructs the city—and the final emptiness reweights the opening ache. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered imagery (nexus, star, ribbon) toward a final image where the lock transforms into song. Orientation anchors who and conceptual where early, though "Shadowed Nexus" remains abstract rather than spatially grounded. The closure—lock disintegrating into song, woman freed—lands on the page with stated relief but the cost is asserted ("crushing weight… gone") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible tradeoff. One meaningful deepening occurs when Silas dissolves the floor, forcing the woman to let go of "emotional grounding," but the payoff is immediate liberation without lingering friction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure lands with visible cost: decades of cold isolation are the price paid for one recovered memory. The accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through months of waiting, tidal alignment, and the sudden beam of light that triggers the key. Causality is clean: Silas's study of broken constellations enables detection of the precise moment. The orientation anchors are present early (dome, Atlantic, shipwrecks), and the final image (starlit quadrangle, her laugh) reweights all prior material with emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The causal lens holds: Silas'sAnnotation → Lenore's strike → fracture → freedom follows motivated linkage, and his deliberate weakening of the seal (pretending reinforcement while marking fracture points) drives the climax. Closure delivers Decisive Change—Lenore emerges solid and breathing—with visible cost in the shattered prism and Silas's need to hide his pride behind the broom-handoff. The single meaningful tightening (shadow's condensed fist striking the marked flaw) narrows options and pays off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian completes the graft and his mind turns to the next task, crystallizing his stance as eternal guardian. However, cost remains conceptual and asserted ("burden," "only harvest that mattered") rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture, no narrowed option, no dramatized price. The waterfall-seed sequence unfolds as a single extended action without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, what) arrive cleanly within the first 100 words. The story accumulates pressure through each knot unraveled, building density and reweighting the mask's silence with conceptual cost. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elian seals the mask but his own unrest remains, forecloses peace, and the final image ("prisoner in a cage of light and quiet") charges prior material with undeniable cost. Causality is clean; no retroactive patches. One tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (dual-timeline comparison accumulates evidence, then causes the mechanism unlock). Closure is on-page—floor spirals, staircase revealed—with a felt cost of channeling grief and the conceptual cost of "repairing the tear with understanding." The metaphor of framing the map by bridging past/present holds cleanly. One meaningful tightening: the woman's grief-posture in vintage footage unlocks the present mechanism. Orientation is swift (vault, henge, map framer role by ~100 words). Minor weakness: the empathy leap feels slightly asserted rather than earned beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes clear anchors (Elias, submersible, *Hesperus* library) within the opening and maintains single-POV, single-scene coherence. The causal lens holds: Elias follows emotional threads → isolates the captain's resistance frequency → arrives at the snow globe → grounds the psychic charge → the transmission ends. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the captain's loop broken, soul laid to rest) with visible cost in the form of the solved mystery now archived and the weight lifting from the library. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes he must witness the collapse of resistance to understand letting go, which narrows his options and drives the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—lands on the page: the courtyard lights smooth, the mural fades, Elian pockets the plate with visible satisfaction. Cost is legible (the bolt plate now "inert," the mural "fulfilled"), though the reconfiguration tilts more toward relief than felt sacrifice. One meaningful deepening (lightning strike as the decisive moment) tightens options under the established lens, satisfying the 600–800 word escalation standard.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: floor-by-floor ascent accumulates sensory detail and rising light intensity until the cipher resolves. The closure—Elian stepping into the solarium carrying "the weight of the secret not as a burden, but as a final gift"—lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he carries private knowledge, foreclosing public mourning). The lens holds throughout, and the resolution reweights the Captain's legacy. One meaningful tightening (light pressure building to revelation) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through cataloging, then breaks pattern with the radiant manifestation, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian realizes preservation exists and documents it—the cost is his solitary witness and the fading of the vision. The escalation from routine observation to transformative proof lands with conceptual cost (he becomes "sole librarian" of a dying archive). One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length and the lens holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal spine. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"he had captured infinity, but he could not grant it immortality"—reweighting the entire artistic quest with undeniable conceptual cost, further charged by the physical demolition. The causal chain (visual failure → tactile coin discovery → fractal translation → demolition arrival) holds cleanly. Orientation anchors appear by ~100 words (Elias, Tree Trunk Library, demolition countdown). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fractal pattern transforms his approach, and the cost is legible in the final image of ephemeral perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece accumulates clues—murmurations, dog-ear geometry, hopscotch grid—that converge in the materialization of stranded luminance, a decisive on-page discovery that reweights her quest. Closure cost is conceptual: she has "charted the unchartable," fulfilling her professional stake. The lens holds through patterned density increase. Minor slip: the luminance dissolves "back into harmless dust motes," softening the cost and leaving the after-state less changed than the buildup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: prophecy → schematic → mechanism → repair. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. The closure lands as Decisive Change (moon released, world rhythm restored) with a felt cost (solitary triumph, weight of last locksmith). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirrors force a navigational choice. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when early (floating orchards, years post-crash, thinning nebula) and tracks a clear causal chain: messages → diagram → reexamination → pump modification → nebula restored. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (collective labor, risk of failure), and the inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (the watering bell's prior insignificance reweighted). One pressure tightening (discovery of the bell's sonic function) narrows options and forces coordinated action. The ending lands on-page with felt consequence, though the success feels complete rather than charged with residual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes "who" and "what" early (Silas, doomsday adjuster, lighthouse) but spatial and temporal anchors remain vague throughout—no concrete "when" or physical layout. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: violet light, nested patterns, and the puppet dissolving build density toward the lullaby's transmission. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (the darkness becomes non-empty), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—Silas dissolves "content," with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies: past ~120 words the reader still cannot anchor time, location scale, or immediate physical space, and this vagueness persists to the end without serving closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. The setup (travelers trapped, frost deadline) links cleanly to Silas's assembly of the override device, which directly causes the birds to fall and the path to open—a Decisive Change with visible cost (exhaustion, the orchard's demand for his return). The ticking clock and the nut's blueprint properties establish constraints that shape tactics. Orientation anchors (cliffside, orchard, labyrinth) land early. One meaningful tightening (frost forming, birds diving) narrows options and the closure reweights his ugly place into "perfect" silence, a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors cleanly (ravine, chemist, widowerhood by ~80 words) and follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: observation → metaphor → chemical insight → symbolic release. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias turns back with formulas racing, the separation "finally closing," and the chrysalis dust released—options reconfigured with felt cost (the weight of atonement now actionable). Cost is visible in the symbolic destruction and the shift from passive grief to active creation. The lens holds, though the insight arrives suddenly without prior failed attempts, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are established early (Glass Orchard Library, opening day lull, Clean Slate Vendor). The demonstration sequence accumulates symbolic weight and the final arrival of the customer offers a Charged Poise moment—options crystallize (erasure as map-making), stakes are visible (his obsessive quest), and the cost is conceptually felt (customers commodified as data). One meaningful deepening occurs when his true motivation is revealed, reweighting the prior demonstration. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost under the chosen lens, though the "hiding the scalpel" line slightly undercuts the poise with melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine: storm reveals water pooling → analysis locates pavilion → excavation → physical contact → ingestion → atmospheric release. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fortress "no longer aching," ready for sun) with felt cost visible in Elara's "shuddering breath" and the neutralized coral. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the final image reweights the opening's "suspended history" into "melancholic" rather than "piercing." One Orientation Test concern: "at the close of an unspoken dream" and the boundary metaphor in paragraph one create brief disorientation, but spatial anchors (courtyard, three feet down) clarify by the second beat, so penalty is waived. Cost proof: the "shuddering breath" and prior "nearly knocked the wind out of her" make suffering legible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift and vivid; the drive lens reads Causal with a single meaningful tightening (slowing the clock forces the silos to parse hybrid language). Closure lands on the page: bridges are built through shared rhythm, the weight is removed, and harmony is restored—a Decisive Change with visible cost (Elara's exertion, the risk of stalling the mechanism). The cost is legible but leans physical rather than relational or conceptual, keeping it from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sensory overload and the mirror's function shifts from broken salvage to psychic prism. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. Closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "she had successfully bridged the gap between the breaker and the broken" crystallizes her transformation into "a living library of the obsolete" with the trembling/vibration motif charging the final image. However, cost remains conceptual and felt rather than visible—no on-page forfeiture or altered tactic post-neural coupling. The "weight" is asserted in the final line without a concrete price legible in prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (waiving orientation penalties). A causal lens holds: gravity inversion → ascent → grotto navigation → sanctum entry → seed activation → escape. However, the closure lands as a competence demonstration rather than a choice with visible cost; "satisfied thought of completion" asserts outcome without showing what was foreclosed or risked. The chronometer warns of collapse, but Elara's escape reads as executed skill, not a decision that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: hedgehog uncurls → Elian acts → analyzes past failure → applies lesson → achieves breakthrough. Closure lands on the page with unmistakable emotional and conceptual cost (the protagonist weeping, siskins fleeing, centuries of silence broken). The drive lens is predominantly Causal with Accumulative textures that support rather than muddle the through-line. Orientation is swift and complete within the opening paragraphs. One persistent constraint (the Great Quieting's silence) shapes every tactic and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early; the piece teaches a contemplative-accumulative lens by the second paragraph and holds it through closure. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elian solves the puzzle, chooses not to return, and commits to remain "the silent guardian of a promise the world had forgotten"—a refusal that forecloses reinstatement with visible cost (continued exile). Cost is legible in the final turn toward the shelter, content to endure. One causal tightening (correlation → epiphany → stance crystallization) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds atmosphere and frequency-tuning attempts toward a closure moment when the clasp opens. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when). The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration as the clasp "sighs" and the diary opens—lands on the page, but the cost is unclear: Elias completes his task without forfeiting, risking, or confronting anything. The fireworks arrival feels decorative rather than reweighting prior material. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows a visible price or foreclosed option at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (botanical observation layered with spiritual quest) and builds density through the weeks-long cultivation, climaxing in the metaphysical window when the flower unfurls. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Elara's final annotation reweights her premise with conceptual cost—she abandons her original goal (impose stillness) in favor of understanding cycle. The "anchor drop within her heart" makes the shift legible and the sacrifice of her initial desire is felt. Orientation is clean by the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (water-flow navigation teaches a discovery pattern). Closure lands on-page: Elara realigns the arrow tip, the tree erupts, and she carries "the song of life back home"—a Decisive Change with visible cost (scramble, time pressure, physical risk). Orientation anchors early (altimeter, Terrus IV, orchard pilot). One meaningful tightening: the Flux inverts gravity, forcing water-navigation, which leads to the amphitheater and the arrow tip solution. Cost is legible in the scramble and the physical eruption that pushes her back.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation cleanly (investigator, Stacks, post-evacuation) and sustains a coherent accumulative lens: data collection intensifies understanding until the final synthesis. The closure operates as Conceptual Repricing—Elara's accumulated sensor readings transform hindsight into predictive foresight, reweighting the investigative mission with a preemptive purpose. Cost is conceptual rather than felt: the weight of future responsibility and the ghosts of past failure. The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image ("calculated near miss") recharges the opening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elian, ice cavern, tonight's aurora ritual). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory and symbolic detail builds toward the bell-ring that sends inspiration down the mountain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculpted hush returns, charged with purpose), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Elian's solitude is reaffirmed without forfeiting a concrete option on the page. The tightening occurs in the single beat where he pulls the rope, sufficient for this length, though the artist's chisel strike happens off-page and the link is told rather than shown in immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when clearly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Silas's ritual (arranging markers, playing the flute) causes the vision that delivers the insight, which reconfigures his understanding with conceptual and emotional cost. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (wisdom gained too late, renunciation of repair) with felt cost visible in "the heavy truth of his error." The tightening from silence → music → vision → departure is meaningful and coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (topaz workshop, letterpress operator, Kael in chair) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and imagery layer toward a final reconfiguration where the Operator absorbs vitality while the equation remains unsolved and stars die. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the machinery of emotional mathematics fails to yield its constant, and the universe darkens in parallel—with conceptual cost legible in the dimmed halo fragment and Kael's hollowing. The linkage is thematic accumulation rather than causal because/therefore, which fits the inferred lens, though one meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options is absent; pressure is atmospheric rather than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows a single continuous scene and infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of imagery and cadence shift at the summit. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the pendant dissolves, Elara's jitters quiet, the world is seeded with potential), but the cost is asserted ("exhausted") rather than dramatically forfeited—no option is visibly foreclosed, and the final image of descending "back into history" remains abstract rather than reweighting prior stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Elias applies the prism → frost reorganizes → Mara sees the silhouettes → her belief about her father's anger is overturned, a Decisive Change with visible emotional cost on the page ("tears hot against her cold cheeks," the invented anger acknowledged). The escalation is modest but sufficient—temperature drops, hush descends, vision appears, burden released—and the final beat reweights prior material with felt cost, satisfying closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Causal/Situational Hybrid, dominant Causal at closure. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the raveling silence provides external pressure that tightens throughout. The closure is a Decisive Change: Elara merges with the loom, the tapestry launches, cost is visible ("her body dissolved into light and motion"). The because/therefore chain holds: she must send the message → she lacks power → she sacrifices herself → the message flies. One meaningful tightening (the orchard breach forces immediate action) is sufficient at this length. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening window. The causal chain is intact: Ewan retrieves the silk, descends, wraps the core, trades illusion for truth, and the planet stabilizes—each beat follows from the prior. Closure lands on-page (the core flares, arches realign, Ewan returns) with a felt cost (the silk dissolves, the trade accepted), satisfying Decisive Change under a Causal lens. Minor issue: the barter mechanism ("paradoxical value," "perfect lie for harsh truth") is asserted rather than dramatized, slightly softening the cost's visibility. Solid execution with one conceptual seam.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens is Causal: Elara's decision to enter the trance → vision of the control room → revelation → physical collapse forms a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image reconfigures her quest—she got the answer but now must carry its unbearable weight—with felt cost legible in "struggling to carry the immense, invisible weight." One small gap: the "command frequency" and "black box" setup in paragraph three feels slightly expository rather than discovered, but the core sequence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sea-glass addition transforms the cairn from distress signal to endurance declaration, and the match-lit glow shatters the oppressive atmosphere, allowing Thomas to find footing—visible cost is Elias's deliberate exposure to the haunted dark and his departure into it. The piece teaches a Causal lens (supply arrival → lamp failure → Thomas's breakdown → Elias's stone-and-light intervention → Thomas stabilizes) with clear because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. One meaningful tightening: the cairn's instability signals distress, Elias's addition locks it, and the flame behind glass charges the final image with palpable relief. The inferred lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph (Silas, Emerald Lighthouse, post-newspaper future) and follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through atmospheric descent, wick ignition, beam steering, storm projection, and shadow-casting over the metropolis. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image ("green shadow of the lighthouse that truly broke the dawn") reweights the opening's "truth was merely light and speed" with conceptual cost (deliberate destruction, confirmed dam burst). The lens holds and one meaningful deepening occurs, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt in Silas's body or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when in opening lines). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, tracking rituals, and the precisely timed experiment; the closure reweights the central question (magnetism as geometry/attention) via the successful dye and the world-leaning-in image. Cost is conceptual and perceptual (understanding achieved, paradigm shift) rather than decisive action or visible loss, which is acceptable under this lens but keeps the score from the highest band. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wing submerges and the reaction confirms his theory, reframing all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with lyric coloring; Elias's problem (blockage) → tool choice (sextant) → keystone discovery → release → repair forms a clean because/therefore chain. The closure lands on the page with visible cost: the tear in reality and the subsequent moonlight repair demonstrate risk and agency. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One tightening occurs when the pin drops and he twists the screw, collapsing the blockage. The final tactile moment—roots speaking—completes the want established early, though the resolution feels assured rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors orientation adequately (alchemical orchard, mirror world, Elara at mica window) and follows a single continuous scene. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the weaving of light accumulates through song → sap → filaments → swaddling → release, with a clear final image (tapestry unfurling, night shattering) that reweights the premise. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration—the constructed dawn succeeds and "some things, once woven, could never be undone" signals irreversible change. Cost is legible in Elara's collapse and the burning of her palms, though the emotional price feels muted by the declarative summary in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements (Hybrid, resolved under Accumulative dominant at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The story teaches its pattern of nestled paradoxes early and pays it off: the invitation-error becomes correctness, hiding reveals, staying-while-leaving grants entry. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elian accepts belonging in the archives, foreclosing solitary retreat. Cost is felt ("tension in his chest unravel," realization that hiding trained him) but could be sharper on the page—no visible forfeiture of a live external option, only internal reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~90 words (Elias, post-migration city, courtyard). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered particulars (elm absence, seed planting, bread taste) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—"the sacred endured" crystallizes the cost and stakes with felt weight. The single scene sustains coherent pressure and one meaningful deepening (from exterior decay to interior ritual). Cost is legible in the final image: the reprieve won't last, but the act reweights his survival guilt. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the measurement sequence, the hologram projection intensifies the atmosphere, and the final ledger-stamp provides closure through pattern completion with a felt cost (the illusion is gone, only data remains). The cost is visible in the line "The illusion was gone, having faded fully into memory, but the data persisted," which reweights the premise. One tightening occurs when the needle drops and figures flicker, forcing faster work.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first two paragraphs; the truce custom and tidal deadline are established early. The drive lens reads as Causal: Elara's false starts force Kael to reset, his frustration accumulates, and his snarl breaks the truce—enabling her vial capture. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: she gains the sound, he gains a trinket, and the unspoken contract shatters on the page. One minor seam: the "distiller's ear" capturing a "dissonant hum" feels convenient—no earlier beat dramatizes her ability to hear trust breaking, only her father's recipe requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail, world-logic reveals, and converging weather-carriers to a final conceptual repricing (Elara becomes what she studied). Orientation anchors early (redwoods, Elara, her mission). The closure unit—cloud forming above her palms—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (loss of observer status), though the felt cost is somewhat abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the system is functional redistribution, not mysticism, which narrows her stance from skeptic to participant. Cost is visible but could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: Silas flees surface ridicule → descends to the cave → destroys the lock → creates and installs the portrait → achieves liberation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the glowing portrait reweights his artistic identity and the cost is conceptually present (years of silence, isolation, the broken lock as foundation). However, the cost is more declared than felt on the page—"he was no longer a machine" reads as summary rather than a dramatized shift in options or a visible forfeiture that alters his next choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Causal: map → descent → clerk's lie → plate reveal → decision to repurpose her craft. Orientation anchors quickly (Veridium, workbench, Elara's role). The closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (beauty to resistance), visible on the page when she "looked at the clerk, then down at the plate, knowing that her gold ink would no longer be used for decoration." One meaningful tightening occurs when the clerk's candor unlocks the plate. The ending choice feels inevitable in hindsight but is told rather than dramatized as a live decision under competing pulls, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara completes her act, the sound cascades, and the final image crystallizes her defiant stance against consensus society. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered description of the sculpture's mechanics and the iceberg's thermodynamic trigger, culminating in a cadence shift at "engineered a shout." Cost is conceptual (the ephemeral nature of the act, the iceberg's sacrifice) but felt on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly (bluff, dawn, Elara's trade) within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs as the ice melts and the sculpture activates, reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (Seven), where (glass dome farm), and the inciting crisis (geomagnetic reversal threatening his memory) land by the end of the first paragraph. The causal chain is legible—nostalgia threatens system integrity, so Seven retrieves the box, transfers the fears, compresses them, and releases the energy to reboot—and the closure (stepping through the broken seal with a "quiet, unified soul") delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the past incinerated, the farm abandoned). One meaningful tightening occurs when the transfer nearly shatters the dome, forcing the compression choice. The lens reads as Causal with a slight Accumulative accent (the marble-sized storm image). Minor slip: the phrase "controlled burn escape" appears as a label in narration but its mechanics (using volatile energy as fuel vs. propulsion) shift slightly between setup and execution, creating a small seam in the because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with late Accumulative elements (the collected stories). Closure unit is a Decisive Change (retrieving the locket stops demolition), and orientation anchors early (courtyard, dawn, eviction threat). However, the locking-mechanism sequence stretches credulity: the combination derives from a sun angle, phantom cane taps, and a child's rhyme with no on-page teaching of how these disparate memories cohere into numbers. The holographic will inside the locket is a convenient solve that bypasses the earned causality of community memory itself—Elara's listening method does not actually heal or unite the fractured community on the page; it simply retrieves a legal document.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (bathysphere, sunken lab, Elara). The closure—blast doors opening and consciousness freed—delivers a Decisive Change with felt cost (she carries "the weight of the ocean with the lightness of a song"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the dance translates grief into authorization, reweighting the inherited trap into liberation. However, the cost at closure is asserted more than shown; we don't see what she sacrifices or forecloses by freeing the AI, only that she "completed a sentence started years ago." The causality holds under the accumulative lens, but the price could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. The whale's death → physics fracture → gravity fluctuations → navigation challenge → exhumation → gravity shriek → flower-anchor → stabilization traces cleanly. Closure lands on-page: Elias reclaims the memory-crystal and survives the fluctuation, a Decisive Change with felt cost (the "breath-stealing thud" and prior terror). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening (gravity shriek triggered by theft) narrows options and forces the psychic-anchor solution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: Elian must interrupt a forming pattern before it locks into disaster. Orientation anchors quickly (solitary summoner, nocturnal glade, brook). The closure—dropping the wing to absorb and neutralize the prophecy—lands on the page with a visible act and a tonal shift to "smoothed hush." Cost is legible in the act of severance and the carry-away of the timeline, though the effect leans more toward conceptual repricing than visceral sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice of silence expands to swallow noise, narrowing the prophecy's potential.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal throughout; the discovery of the seal triggers interrogation, which prompts revelation, which forces choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Silas accepts the deceptive burden with visible cost (vertigo, chilling realization, weight in palm)—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara's explanation reframes the entire premise from translation to lying-as-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Elara archives the volatile memory, loses the haunting comfort, and accepts solitude. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered sensory detail and charged imagery until the final cadence shift ("empty gaze...terrifying lightness"). Orientation anchors (velvet garden, twilight, mental construct) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brother crystallizes and the memory compresses into inert stone, foreclosing her grief-refuge with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors within 120 words (Elian, roofless atrium, clepsydra, aurora). The closure is a Decisive Change—condemned→commended—with on-page cost (lifting the "n," grafting the stroke, risking magister detection). The thorn-and-key sequence creates a because/therefore chain that narrows options and makes the alteration legible. The final image ("phantom scent of roses") charges prior material but lacks a second visible price that would elevate cost beyond the forgery's completion; the stakes resolve cleanly without an additional forfeiture that shapes the departure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—progressive disclosure builds density through layered acoustic returns that deepen the mystery. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final revelation that echoes are "living monuments to their own murder" reweights the premise with conceptual cost, and Elara's turn toward the city signals a stance shift. Orientation anchors (Elara, Serpentine Nexus, starlight) arrive early. One friction: the "webs of intrigue" and Silent Council mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, so the political layer remains somewhat abstract, but the core acoustic mystery escalates cleanly and the ending reconfigures prior material with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is legible by the opening paragraph (who, where, what), and the piece holds a single POV throughout. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through dream-shard accretion toward a final reconfiguration (the boy's courage revealed, grief lifted). However, closure cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"the heavy sensation of grief lifted" and "a lightness that felt like forgiveness" tell the transformation without an on-page image or action that makes the price undeniable. The synchronization of dream cameos is summary, not scene, which keeps the decisive reweighting conceptual rather than felt. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the final beat lacks visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds through fireflies, matcha foam, moon paths, culminating in the whistle-sphere moment. However, the closure unit—"witnessed the lattice...duly honored"—delivers Conceptual Repricing without visible cost; Elian's options and stance remain unchanged. The final tea-drinking image is lovely but does not reweight prior stakes with felt sacrifice or foreclosed possibility, preventing entry to the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (wasteland orchard, Elias Vane, conspiracy debunker). The plot moves through clear because/therefore links: breach lab → find shredded letters → reassemble → understand diamond mechanism → machine failing → repair it. Closure is a Decisive Change (machine stabilized, orchard preserved) paired with a stated cost (exposing the story destroys the protective fear). However, the cost remains assertion rather than on-page image: "It was a heavy price" tells rather than shows the forfeiture, and the final beat ("turned to walk back through the silent trees") doesn't reweight prior material or make the trade-off undeniably felt in the moment. One meaningful tightening (machine failure forces the repair) is present, meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the Cost Proof Test reveals no exact sentence where the price is legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Silas, observatory, tempest outside). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas recognizes his exile from the dawn he sparked, the radio equipment hums abandonment, and he accepts loneliness as "the necessary price." Cost is felt—he remains trapped behind glass while the revolution blooms without him. One meaningful deepening occurs when variant allegiance shifts loyalty from broadcaster to subject, narrowing Silas's options and reweighting his control. The piece holds its lens through image and cadence shift, though the causality of "variant allegiance" as a phenomenon feels asserted rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory particulars and ritual detail toward a single intensification when the waltz plays and transforms the space. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the loft becomes a ballroom; the poet speaks and the world listens) with conceptual cost implied through isolation and effort. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the music shifts from screech to crystalline melody, reweighting the dominant stake of preserving the past's beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (engineer, gantry, marina, sunset timeframe). The key's refusal to turn creates a motivated pivot: Elias abandons mechanical force for vibrational matching, engaging the horn that delivers sonic absolution—a clean causal chain. Closure lands on-page with felt cost (organs shaken, exhaustion, the dead "finally asleep") and the inferred lens holds. One meaningful tightening (protocol failure → adaptation) is sufficient at this length, though the escalation could apply more constraint before the solution appears.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, viaduct) and the causal chain is legible: rain on the viaduct → altered conductivity → lunar pull at zenith → grounding current released → bridge collapse. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the supply line severed, the rebellion begun) that lands on the page. A minor seam: the phrase "magnetic viaduct after rain" is told twice in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild redundancy without adding pressure. The inferred lens is Causal, held cleanly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly on the page: Elias's upload is a Decisive Change that forecloses his advancement and reconfigures his relationship to institutional power, with the cost made explicit ("ending his advancement within the Agency"). The causal lens holds—his empirical findings drive the defiant choice. Orientation is swift (tunnel, investigator role, Halloway's demand by ~150 words). One meaningful tightening: the infrasound discovery narrows his options from rubber-stamp to genuine hazard declaration. Minor slip: the psycho-acoustic mechanism arrives somewhat late and resolves the investigative problem it introduces, reducing prior escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece anchors who/where/when early (chaplain, shop, present moment carrying a bundle). Escalation operates through the unveiling sequence—unwrap, examine, light shift, key turn, music activation—culminating in "It didn't need fixing... it just needed to be heard," which reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost. The final image ("vibrant accusation in the hush") charges prior material and forecloses Elias's path of spiritual comfort, meeting the RR/CR requirement with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Unit Seven achieves his goal with visible cost—isolation in silence, the joke no one hears. The causal chain (observe storms → carve patterns → launch → ring bell) holds without breaks. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the workshop dissolves, forcing the launch. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric coloring; the ending reweights the yearning algorithm's price without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: the recurring numbers lead to audio layering, which yields coordinates, which unlock the hidden partition. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—discovery of trapped consciousnesses—lands on the page with conceptual horror as cost, and the grip on the patch charges the final image. One meaningful tightening (drone encounter → merge execution → revelation) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with symbolic/lyric architecture: the lighthouse repository, the vintage mirrors, and the crystal fragment build a pattern that culminates in projection. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (orchard, cliff, council), though the metaphysical detour inside the lighthouse introduces mild spatial ambiguity. Closure lands on the page—council sees the projected mercy, ice stops grinding—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or price paid by Kaelen himself. The final paragraph's "for the first time in an age" claim exceeds POV scope.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias trawls debris, seeking a sound, until the parasol tip crystallizes his understanding and releases him toward the clinic. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—he finds the sound he sought, which reweights his earlier deferral and makes the return to the clinic legible. Cost is conceptual and felt: the fold collapses, the search ends, and he accepts mortality's texture. One minor ambiguity: the "sound" itself remains metaphorical rather than concretely signaled in earlier beats, slightly softening the causal groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias's intervention and metaphor causally enable the woman's shift, while the pavilion and letter imagery accumulate meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she chooses to wait out the cold with new understanding, forecloses the path of clinging to the letter. The cost is legible in the release gesture and her acceptance of the night ahead. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). One meaningful tightening occurs when the metaphor reframes her grief.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final ritual seals the archive and Elian retreats, mission complete with visible cost (the lore sleeps, inaccessible even to him). Drive lens reads Causal with situational pressure; the because/therefore chain holds from Prophet's threat → journey → confession → consecration. Orientation anchors quickly (desert, half-masked walker, post-Prophet timeframe). One meaningful tightening occurs at the threshold test, narrowing options and forcing honesty. Cost is on the page but felt primarily as conceptual (knowledge hidden) rather than immediate personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes a metaphysical premise but never dramatizes a causal turn or meaningful tightening. Elian's ritual unfolds through summary ("He stood there for hours") without on-page pressure or a choice that narrows options. The "shift" and "relief" are asserted outcomes, not closure effects arising from agency or cost. Under an accumulative lens, the piece would need density increase or cadence shift to reweight stakes—neither occurs; the final paragraph merely restates the opening conceit without repricing it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias moves from guarding "a graveyard of fixed meanings" to "announcing a birth," a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (abandoning his life's work of preservation). The piece operates under a Causal lens—discovery of moss → recognition of contradiction → decision to testify via fractured syntax → breakthrough realization—with clear because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, post-dictionary epoch) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crystal's sonic reflection enables him to bypass dead grammar, narrowing his tactical options to broken syntax only, and the final realization ("growth was not a straight line") reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, VHS decay, and driftwood markers build density toward a resonant final image. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elias sits "content to let the future fade," accepting entropy with visible relinquishment of his prophetic gift. The cost is legible: he stops fighting amnesia and accepts the "quiet disintegration." Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (junkyard prophet, mist-curated landscape). One meaningful deepening occurs when the markers lead him to the crater and he stops seeking, letting the hum of decay wash over him. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is established swiftly: Elian, Spire observatory, lunar timeframe. Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative hybrid; the spinning hand's escalating speed forces tactical choices (restructuring the shutter, tuning by ear) that tighten toward the closure image. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the shutter releases "by the sound of a leaf falling," capturing the Green Flash, and Elian's ache transforms into "a permanent lantern." Cost is legible (he endures the earthquake, shields the camera with his fragility, and the ache does not vanish but changes quality). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mechanism achieves the threshold sound, unlocking the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the musical ritual gathers density through repeated imagery (scent of hope, the vinyl shard, golden acoustic warmth) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Clara's breathing stills and "the silence that followed was not empty, but full." The closure lands with felt cost—Clara's death—and the final line reweights the premise. However, orientation is delayed; who Elias is and his exact role emerge gradually rather than by ~120 words, and the nurse's nod functions as a late anchor for the inciting circumstance rather than an early stake signal.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Causal: each mechanical step (connect conduit → insert key → adjust valve) tightens toward the artificial noon that reveals the shadows' behavior. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the riddle is answered on the page, shadows "crushed by the weight of light"—with a visible, if quiet, cost: she resets the machine knowing the knowledge will fade by morning. The because/therefore chain holds, and the realization reweights the opening question. However, the final act is passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path, limiting full closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the doctor's perception and metaphorical alignment (cleft, bone-setting) until the final image of the parents grasping the tooth as navigational hope. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the parents' grief is reweighted into hope with a visible conceptual cost (accepting displacement over death). The lens holds, and the ending reframes prior material, though the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the polishing ritual, and the final image (the jewel drinking gloom and exhaling glow) reweights the opening trauma with a felt cost—Elara has transformed debris into safety but remains earthbound, tethered to past fear. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she has achieved her craft goal but the cost is implicit in the "earthbound star watcher" frame—she cannot visit the planets she charts, only manufacture their light. One meaningful deepening occurs when panic recedes into "zephyr bloom," narrowing her emotional options and affirming her commitment to the safer, earthbound path.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, abandoned data center, three weeks post-confession) land by ~120 words. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the drip pattern → amber discovery → Mara encounter sequence accumulates density and reweights the dominant stake (Mara's sanctuary versus exposure). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared "honeyed hush" crystallizes as a safe inhabitation with the pendant as anchor; cost is legible in Mara's reliance and Elias's silent vigil. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with conceptual-repricing closure: the final image (galaxy of stolen lights) reweights the opening premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph without delay. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias extracts Elara's hope, altering her capacity for the tragic ending. The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost (Elara's dimmed eyes, the collection of lights), though the causal linkage between extraction and her subsequent hollowness could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (moonlight, song, golden projections) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the village's collective memory is reawakened. The closure image—golden tableaux dissolving into dew, vine spent—crystallizes the trade (life force for transmission) and reconfigures the village's relationship to the land. Cost is legible (the vine "brown and spent, having given its life force"), and the "heaviness of neglect had lifted" marks a before/after shift. However, the entire arc is largely inevitable; no mid-story tightening narrows options or forces Elian to adapt tactics, only a patient wait for celestial alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph one; drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a single continuous ritual escalating toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the completed map hums with the orchard's pulse). The flash-paper incineration visibly fuses starlight into copper, altering the object's state and charging the final image. Cost is conceptual—the orchard's ephemeral heartbeat is now fixed in metal—but the cost proof test is borderline: no sentence shows what Silas relinquishes or what option this forecloses for him. One tightening deepens stakes; the second-to-last beat lands the transformation, then the seal gesture closes without additional complication.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, reflection, and mechanical detail toward a single harvest moment. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cavern stripped of spirit, wonder "contained" in the machine, with the promise of future release. Cost is stated abstractly ("cavern was suddenly dead") but legible. The tightening from observation to harvest is present but much of the escalation occurs in summary ("For weeks..."), weakening the felt pressure at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the recursive regret pattern build pressure until the alignment-and-calcification beat shifts the emotional register and forecloses the spiral with visible cost (the sorrow becomes dead stones in a satchel). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis, as Elara endures the somber cycle and waits for the next burden—with felt cost legible in "dense, dead weight" and the sealing quiet. One deduction: the middle escalation is primarily descriptive intensification rather than a choice-driven tightening, which slightly softens causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors (loft, kettle, workbench) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density (rain drumming → ghost applause → kettle scream) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara transfers grief into wood and continues to live, a stance crystallization with visible cost ("the ghost she had exorcised"). The kettle timeframe provides both constraint and cadence shift. One tightening (the moment freezes, then shatters) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible in the final image of steam rising and vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; lens reads Causal/Accumulative hybrid, holding through closure. The revelation that Jaren himself sabotaged the Carousel lands on the page with felt cost ("hot and suffocating"), and the camera wheel's backward spin attempts rewind but "only clicked forward" delivers Conceptual Repricing. One meaningful tightening occurs at the ghost exchange. Minimal deduction for lens ambiguity in the middle third, resolved by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture: Elias's problem-solving steps link clearly (pressure valves → pneumatic lines → sextant lens → hologram ignition). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image crystallizes his theorem of restoration with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual and somewhat oblique—he has proven a point but lingers alone in carnival trash—yet the stakes and meaning reweight. Orientation is clean. One meaningful tightening occurs when the missing crystal is solved by the sextant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—petrichor → memory → forecourt → vibration → tears → return forms a cadence that deepens pressure and reweights the dominant stake (peace with an abandoned dream). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Elian, Order, storm aftermath). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he bears the weight, then returns to the clock, foreclosing the luthier path with felt cost visible in "leaving his ghost behind." One meaningful tightening (the shift from nostalgia to communion to renunciation) suffices at this length. Causality holds under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texturing. The salvage anchors early, escalates through winch tension and radio silence, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias lowers the evidence, foreclosing the exposure path with visible cost (he "possessed the truth now, and that was enough"). The sundial/hull-plate logic chains causally, and the radio-silence deadline tightens the window. One minor gap: the sundial's rust-fused angle and gnomon mechanics are asserted more than demonstrated—by what exact process does a bent gnomon at the "mark he had calculated" prove noon sinking?—but the closure reconfigures his relationship to the city's lies with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds through fog, cold, and oceanic imagery until the knot-decoding climaxes in a moment of resolution ("the pattern resolved itself"). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias completes his task and departs, preserving ancient knowledge in his memory—but the cost remains conceptual and abstract ("weight of the harvested truth") rather than felt or dramatized on the page. One meaningful deepening (finding the seed within the triple-folded hitch) satisfies length expectations, though the ending's resonance is muted by summary rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (harbor, hilltop estate, garden, veranda) arrive promptly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the Countess accepts solitude, the narrator charts "one more small corner," both stranded for winter. The cost is legible—she holds the severed thread as relic, isolation deepens—but the tightening is minimal; the narrator's page-handing and her reading compress what could be a more fraught exchange. One meaningful deepening (thread snap, acceptance) suffices for this length, though the causal linkage between the written page and her emotional shift is asserted more than earned beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land quickly: obsidian palace, Prince Valerius, kneeling at workbench. The drive lens is Causal: assembly → machine hums → egg cracks → bird emerges → realization of tragic incompatibility. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/bitterly sweet recognition) with conceptual cost legible on the page: "beauty he had awakened was too fragile for the grinding machinery." One meaningful tightening (egg fracture to chirp to breathing struggle) narrows options and delivers felt consequence. Minor slip: the palace-swaying motif recurs without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Elara, the lagoon, the ritual timeframe. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through the delicate grafting ritual and resolves when the branch hums, reweighting the "scars can sing" motif with conceptual cost (her father's legacy transformed). Closure lands on the page with a felt reconfiguration: the foreign coin clicks as metronome, the wood hums rather than screams. One meaningful deepening is achieved. The cost is somewhat implied rather than viscerally shown; we infer effort and validation but do not see a visible forfeiture or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines (geese, city, Elara) and follows a clear causal chain: auditory clues → cistern → box → alignment → release. The closure is a Decisive Change (memories freed, geese resume flight) with conceptual cost visible in Elara's concession that "magic was real," reweighting her skeptic stance. However, the stellar alignment functions as a convenience lock that Elara calculates but does not struggle against; the universe simply delivers the key on schedule, weakening agency at the peak turn. The inferred lens is Causal with a situational overlay (cosmic timing), held consistently to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sonar navigation, the gear's fractal properties, and the garden's phosphorescent transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Xylos achieves his goal yet realizes he has rendered his own purpose obsolete, a felt cost visible in "profound, unexpected loneliness" and "the end of his purpose." Orientation anchors who/where/what by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gear catches and the garden glows cold instead of burning, reweighting the ancestral burning pattern with a visible alternative and a conceptual price (obsolescence of mourning).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout the greenhouse scene. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the recurring motifs (butterflies, ribbon, poem-sharing ritual, spectral presence) build density across weeks of mentorship, culminating in the moth-tracing action that reweights Elias's understanding from "perfect circle or straight line" to "tangled knot." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final carving design of "overlapping vines and knotted silk" reconfigures the premise of collective grief as messy continuity—with conceptual cost legible in the abandoned ideal of orderly geometry. One meaningful deepening (the ribbon-tracing revelation) suffices for this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Silas, clock tower, coastline) arrive quickly. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through ritual detail, metaphor, and the fractal nesting of personal guilt within communal time. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas completes the micro-adjustment, "a little more of his burden had been eroded away," and the clock "beat[s] in time with his beating heart." Cost is legible: inscriptions worn, wood burned, and another increment of penance consumed. One meaningful deepening occurs at the pause, reweighting the entire ritual with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure—Silas discovering the paper, which reconfigures the chaotic tapestry into a clear image of waiting—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) with conceptual cost legible in the shift from "storm of confusion" to "portrait of waiting." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs. The causal sequence (timer stops → inspect → untangle → discover case → read note → tapestry settles) holds without contradiction, though the escalation is gentle—one meaningful deepening rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The cost is felt more as understanding than as a price Silas pays, which keeps this shy of 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal-Situational Hybrid; the piece builds through exposition of predictive modeling toward a crystallized decision moment. Orientation is swift (profession, location, stakes by ~100 words). Closure reads as Charged Poise: the nib touches paper, collapsing probability into history with visible cost (the burden of lying truthfully, the cascading panic he foresees). The cost is conceptual and felt rather than a decisive physical change, and the final image reconfigures the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when doubt threatens to stall him and he commits. Slight deduction for the extended reflective middle that delays the pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The accumulative lens holds: dust particles magnetized by narrative weight, the violet glow as physical manifestation, and the planned dispersal into citizens' lungs all deepen the dominant stake (ending the story famine through infection of wonder). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elian's satisfaction and readiness for the next song crystallize his stance with the cost implied in "quiet rebellion" and the risk just evaded. The cost feels more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page, which keeps this from the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under a causal lens with an accumulative lyric overlay: Silas grinds ash → creates portrait → destroys it at the precise moment the chair stops, triggering Elara's realization. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the safety of holding on was the mirage, and the only reality is the beauty of the end" lands with conceptual cost—Elara's investment in permanence is foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs when Silas's exhalation shatters the image. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The rocking chair timeframe creates a persistent constraint that shapes the ritual's timing and charges the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal lens holds: Silas's weeks of excavation lead to finding the cog, which enables the clock repair, which produces the ticking—a clean because/therefore chain. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ticking is a "rhythmic heresy" that crystallizes his rebellion and reconfigures the narrative contest between priest and philosopher, with the conceptual cost (starting a war) made legible in the final image. Orientation anchors emerge within the first 120 words (sunken city, sewers, post-plague). One meaningful tightening occurs when the cog snaps into place and the escapement kicks, narrowing options from search to actualization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers description, reflection, and a single extended beat toward a climactic convergence. Orientation anchors (Velvet Library, autumn, Elian as teacher) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the chord forms, breaks, and Elian returns to the window with "traveled stillness," crystallizing the paradox that harmony is possible yet unsustainable. Cost is felt—he has shown them beauty they cannot sustain—but the on-page action of the final paragraph is minimal, which mutes the charge slightly under accumulative expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: seed → chaotic growth absorbing trauma → pruning redirects neural pathways → transformed fruit. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (severed limbs, sap bleeding) and Elias's tasting the final wedge delivers a decisive change in the fruit's knowledge-payload. Orientation anchors quickly (rusted greenhouse, twin moons, Elias with seed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the plant "exploded upward" and threatened to poison minds, forcing the pruning sequence that narrows options and delivers the sweet outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: Silas's stance crystallizes under pressure from Kael's demand, and the revelation of the corrupted protocol forecloses the restart path. Orientation anchors quickly (toll keeper, tower, post-blackout), and the closure—Kael's defeat paired with forced contemplation of the dusk—lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (the city cannot be fixed). The causal chain holds: Silas knew, did not report, now reveals. One deduction for the reveal itself feeling slightly convenient as a resolution device rather than arising inevitably from prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece is single-POV, one continuous scene at the bay, with clear spatial anchors (Victorian home, porch, road below). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the placement ritual, and the "shard of hush" crystallization. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final image reweights the house, root, and silence motif, and the felt cost is present in "surrendered to the encroaching gray of dawn." However, the fisherman's shout supplies the key insight rather than protagonist action, and the conceptual cost (recognizing decay as a form of sanctification) remains more cerebral than visceral, preventing entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (Elara, deep ocean, post-secret revelation). The causal chain is clean: Caelum's vine-threading triggers the mirror mechanism, which reveals the children in stasis, which reweights the foxglove from poison to cure, driving Elara's decision to break the vessel. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she moves toward the dais "ready to trade her simple accusation for a complex responsibility," crystallizing the reweighted stakes with felt cost (surrendering moral certainty). The Causal lens holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early (Elian, infinite staircase); the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (mathematical proof + perpetual motion paradox). The closure unit is a Decisive Change: the rupture opens, Elian grasps the missed opportunity's texture, and the staircase crumbles. Cost is legible—he stakes "his continued existence on a theorem"—and the final image shows him clutching the second chance. One minor causality wrinkle: the chipped die's refusal to settle and emission of a "high-pitched whine" introduces new physics late without prior cue that dice can violate gravity in this reality, but the ending remains coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear causal–accumulative hybrid lens: Elian's moonlight ritual leads to the distant signal, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the connection confirms his hypothesis with visible emotional cost (years of insomnia now rewarded). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the greenhouse paragraph (~80 words). The tightening from solitary ritual to distant response is legible, and the cost—his exhaustion finally yielding to sleep—lands on the page. One minor slip: the signal's mechanics (someone "knew the grammar of compassion") leans slightly toward wish fulfillment, but the prior causality of the lost language and his years of practice make it credible enough.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece accumulates sensory detail and cultural weight toward a closure that crystallizes stance (eating the words to preserve them internally). The thaw operates as a ticking environmental pressure that forces the bread solution, and the final image reweights the opening's "rosewater dread" into defiant preservation. Cost is conceptual—physical texts lost, community forced into embodied memory—and legible in the girl biting the crust. One meaningful deepening (silent ice → roaring falls) tightens options. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, lighthouse gallery, low tide) arrive early. The causal lens dominates: yoyo disassembly → gyroscope integration → tide reversal. However, the closure—tide rushes back, stone vanishes—lands as spectacle without felt cost; Elias laughs softly and feels years lift, but no on-page price or foreclosed path is legible. The final image signals triumph over destiny but does not reweight prior material with visible sacrifice or consequence, weakening the closure unit under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure—Elias's confession inverts fear's food source, the mirror implodes, and the atmosphere lifts, reweighting the "repulsive allure" premise with felt cost (burned palm, closed dictionary). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the funhouse entrance within the first beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when he reaches the mirror and offers vulnerability instead of terror, narrowing the entity's options. The causal chain (resuscitation → luminance → Advisor → dream dictionary → paradox navigation → confession) holds under accumulative logic, though the mechanics of why apathy "starves" fear remain more thematic assertion than dramatized rule.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal drive: storm approaching → Elara creates fractal resonance → storm channels through her design → orchard survives. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's philosophy is validated, the orchard stands, and the cost is legible in her physical exhaustion ("chest heaving") and the hour-long ordeal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm hits the resonance wall and is forced to conform. The lens is Causal and holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative layering. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The whistle triggers a causal chain (sound → response → crack → revelation) that narrows Elara's options from "understand trajectory" to "recognize entrapment," meeting the meaningful tightening requirement. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the city, turtles, and sun as components of a delivery system with undeniable conceptual cost (freedom was never possible). One persistent constraint—the rusted gate—shapes the entire premise and final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accents (the ivy metaphor deepens). Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when). The closure unit is a Decisive Change—Elara physically recaptures the Letter, dismantling the regime's mythology—with felt cost to the Censor and implied societal upheaval. The "because/therefore" chain from petal-drop armistice expiry → confrontation → parallel argument → capitulation → possession is clear and motivated. One tightening (the Red Blight analogy narrows the Censor's defenses) is sufficient at this length. Cost is visible on the page in the Censor's defeat and the final image of pruning/growth, though the protagonist's personal cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece runs Accumulative/Textural under a single continuous night scene. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of dreams standing firm while the city sinks reweights Elias's labor from futile patching to intentional fossil-seeding, with the conceptual cost visible in "even as the city sank." The work is legible and coherent. The middle segment—clearing the fissure and embedding the vial—provides one meaningful tightening (the physical obstacle must be overcome before the ritual completes). Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (nightly drawbridge, sinking district, surveyor by trade, slippery cobblestones toward the pavilion edge). No causality breaks; the sequence coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements: blackout → stillness → physical decryption → revelation. Closure lands as Decisive Change (discovery) combined with Charged Poise (pocketing the stamp, organizing next steps) with conceptual cost legible in "dangerous truth that could shatter the city's glass walls." The two-paragraph historical exposition (founding era, High Council claims) sits near the 20% threshold but anchors present stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stamp clicks and text shifts. Cost is felt but slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: shadow detaches → memories leak → Elias polishes prism to trap dream → transforms it to crane → releases it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crane's launch crystallizes the paradox and his grief becomes a permanent orbit around the Basilica, foreclosing reunion but preserving her dream. Cost is legible in "luminous torment that would circle the glass spires forever."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: overload → darkness → opportunity to hunt → perturbation → vision → breakers reset → collapse → decision to repeat. Orientation anchors (Elias, floating observatory, zero-gravity, circuit breaker cooldown) arrive within the first few lines. The closure is a Charged Poise with visible cost: Elias reaches for the override knowing he must "break the world just to see the beautiful ruins," crystallizing his commitment to destructive repetition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the breakers threaten to snap back, forcing his desperate attempt to touch the viewport before reality returns.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with strong situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The escalation from flight → arrival → recognition → extraction follows motivated linkage. Closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the Pilgrim slumps into darkness) and the protagonist's identity reconstruction is shown through the scrolling text. The cost is present but could be more viscerally felt; Elara's emotional reaction to deactivating the Pilgrim is muted, which slightly undercuts the weight of the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of layered memory, physical object, and guilt that coheres by the final image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elian accepts the watch hand's weight, recognizing he cannot restore the heir he turned into a ghost—a renunciation that forecloses redemption with on-page cost ("heavier than any lie"). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finds the watch hand and the true memory "assaults him," narrowing his stance from abstract penance to concrete acknowledgment. Cost is legible in "the metal biting into his skin" and the final line's darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Silas recycles physical failure into salvation, earning the right to release its weight—a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (the object left behind, emotional release dramatized through "tired, knowing smile"). Causal lens holds: broken lever → improvised solution → chains dissolve → protagonist transformed. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph one (who, where, stakes). Single scene with coherent escalation from negotiation setup through mechanism failure to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias accepts his limitations, renounces grand navigation, and follows the utility poles with visible cost—the compass remains in his pocket, "a heavy souvenir of a life he could no longer afford to live." One meaningful deepening occurs when panic flares in fog but stabilizes upon seeing the next pole, crystallizing his new method. The lens holds; the final image ("he was moving") reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who, where, when anchor by the elevator descent. The closure lands on-page with a decisive choice (throwing the ball) and visible emotional cost (weeping for the ghosts). Causal lens holds: the procedure → apathy → search for empathy → lake encounter → ball sacrifice → reconnection. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lake's fractal patterns reveal diverging timelines, forcing Elias to confront stolen futures. The cost is felt, though the mechanism (lake as Oracle) introduces a late convenience that slightly softens earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory intensification (scent → heat → metamorphosis → physical contact) and lands Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the cosmic intimacy crystallizes their orbit with felt biological and relational cost). Orientation anchors clearly by line two (Elian, orchard, post-phoenix-rise). Causality holds: fortune → censer → smoke → dive → metamorphosis → recognition. One meaningful deepening occurs when his refusal to retreat forces biological rewriting. Cost is visible: he loses his human form and the fortune burns, forecloses return to mortality. Closure image ("standing silent and eternal") reweights the opening stillness with undeniable transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through ritual layers (tablecloth, saucer, cards) to a final cadence shift when the spread "shows him the anatomy of his neglect." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis: Silas refuses understanding with visible cost—he "feigned confusion, tracing the empty spaces...pretending the answer was still hidden"—foreclosing acceptance and crystallizing his denial. The cost is legible on the page (he remains trapped in self-deception), though the final image could charge harder with a concrete gesture rather than summary of pretense.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal arc: Elian must integrate his shadow to resonate with the relic and unlock the door. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the second paragraph without penalty. The closure—floating before the opened door—delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the agonizing integration) under a primarily Causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door that "remained impassive" finally "groaned in submission." The cost is legible in "agonizing" and "burning acceptance," though the physical act of opening the door feels somewhat anticlimactic after the psychic surgery.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the opening). The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and the prophecy framework. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—Silas realizes transformation is surrender—but the cost is asserted ("he felt fuller") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible trade-off on the page. The prophecy machinery resolves the volcano threat via coincidence, which complicates but does not advance agency-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal design: blackout enables access, quill holder unlocks mechanism, Cradle awakens and corrupts surveillance feeds. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara resumes her post with a "faint, knowing smile" and the city "looks the same" but operates on a different frequency. The final image asserts liberation and potential but does not show a foreclosed path, a price paid, or a stance crystallized with undeniable pressure. The revolution "embeds itself" off-page; the decisive change is told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the first two paragraphs. The structure follows a single continuous scene under a causal lens: Oren arranges the trap, the eel arrives, he captures it, achieving temporary friction. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he has fulfilled his promise within a small circle, knowing it will degrade, and accepts that cost by sitting still. The cost is visible: his visions halt, but the sanctuary is temporary and the eel will break free. One meaningful tightening occurs when the eel lunges and the gauntlet snaps, narrowing options to this fragile moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The story follows a single continuous scene with one dominant stake (revealing the map) and a causal arc: timer governs the chemical process, storm reaches zenith, solvent applied, map revealed. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (wonder replaces fear; the map validates memory), and the final image reweights the premise with felt emotional cost. The lens is Causal with lyric texture. Deduction: the protagonist's agency is passive—he executes a predetermined procedure rather than making a choice that narrows options; the map's revelation changes his emotional state but does not alter future tactics on the page, leaving cost implied rather than legible in a foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Situational lens: Silas decodes the sundial to locate the Northern Door, prompting Kael's acceptance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure—Kael dropping his guard after Silas names the door—lands as a stance crystallization with implied diplomatic cost, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the causal chain feels engineered: the needle-tin cipher solves the puzzle too smoothly, and the "hidden overture" remains abstract rather than a felt tactical shift that reweights prior choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights "resistance" from expected fire/riots to gardens/poems, and the moonlight blessing legitimizes the act. Cost is conceptual (slow, patient defiance vs. immediate action) and the "invincible certainty of spring" signals foreclosed alternatives. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Elias, rusted library, violet atmosphere). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coffee tin reveals ink-seeds, narrowing their method and crystallizing the blooming-resistance metaphor into literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear causal through-line: deteriorating station → Elias rigs projector with clock parts → enters film → plays final encore before the light dies. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he steals a moment of grace with visible cost (the projector's finite bulb, the inevitable darkness). Orientation anchors quickly (station, piano, observation deck) and the inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture in the final arbor sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when he steps through the projector beam, narrowing his options to this stolen sanctuary. The cost is legible in "only until the horizon invites night" and the fading bulb, and the final image—darkness as applause—reweights his defiance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early; the piece follows a single continuous scene with one POV and one dominant stake (preserving collective memory before the storm). The drive lens is Causal: Elian uses the kaleidoscope, interprets dreams, speaks verification syntax, and the ground responds in sequence, enabling him to plant the seed. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost—the seed roots in harsh truth, the plant emerges with ancestral faces, and Elian shields it while "luminous doubt persists," forecloses the beautiful lie. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ground "shudders" and "hardens," narrowing his options to this one fissure. The final image of him as "anchor of flesh and bone" against the rain demonstrates visible cost. Minor: the "swapping one dream for another" line slightly hedges the decisiveness, but the physical act and rooted plant establish the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual density and sensory intensification toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the indigo light as Conceptual Repricing). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening. The closure—finding "the color of unspoken apologies"—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the severance context, years of burden), and the compass settling provides a before/after shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the air shimmers and voices return, reweighting his isolation. The cost is somewhat abstract but legible through the "aching indigo" and tears.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)

The persistent constraint of the sanctions shapes tactics throughout, and the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—Silas's realization that unused love is fuel for action—and felt cost in his reduced heart pressure. The causal lens holds strong from inciting incident to resolution, with no orientation debt. The viaduct setting and camera method act as persistent constraints shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a decisive change with felt cost as memories disintegrate and Elian feels the texture of time, weeping in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change (inverting protocols) that reconfigures stakes under a causal lens; cost is legible in the final image of enclosed safety amidst terror, and orientation is clear early without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with palpable cost under an accumulative lens; the star's extinction and map completion form a Resonant Reconfiguration, and the inferred lens holds without contradiction, shaping tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost—Unit 734's continued search without resolution. The causal drive lens holds, with orientation anchored early (robot janitor in frozen courtyard at twilight). The final image of dropping the violin into the recycler reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Plot follows a causal lens with clear linkage from inciting incident to closure. Orientation is anchored early, and closure lands with cost as trust is restored through the lens. The decisive change is legible and resonant.

    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias connects to the Maestro and the silence feels complete, with cost legible in his isolation. The Hybrid drive lens holds, combining causal actions (disrupting water leads to discovery) with accumulative texture. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the constraint of water shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Under a Causal lens, the plot escalates through because/therefore linkages from fever recovery to the smudging action, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible in "the crushing solitude of his position," and the persistent constraint of his fault-tolerance shapes tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: Silas's release of the valve wheel and understanding of negligence's weight, reconfiguring his burden with felt cost. The causal lens holds tightly, driven by radio calls and valve discovery. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the valve shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens is accumulative/textural, focusing on atmosphere and decay, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara reaches the obsidian refuge, accepting the library's end with cost legible in "the crumbling peace." Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. The origami swan's use as a transition vessel is set up early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)

Causality is modest but coherent—his implant-conditioned perception leads to analysis, which leads to reinterpretation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from treating catastrophe as mere physics to acknowledging the emotional and aesthetic weight of that physics, crystallized in the final gesture of taking the flake on his fingertip. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, which slightly limits impact at the “prestige” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: arson → escape into canyon → decision to wait for frost → discovery of tracks → commitment to follow them. Orientation is excellent; who/where/when and the inciting attempt on her life are clear very early. Closure lands as a decisive change of stance—she moves from hiding and waiting to active pursuit—framed by the visible trail and the charged object in her hand. Stakes and costs are scaled appropriately for the length, though the danger from the smugglers remains off-page and could be made more concrete to heighten structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: silence-world premise → fractured thermal symphony → orchids flickering → Elian using adapted tools to correct the imbalance → orchids’ survival. Orientation (who/where/when and the rules of the world) is clear early, and the single-scene structure holds without confusion. Closure lands via a decisive change: the orchids move from imminent failure to stable survival, and his composition metaphorically “resolves” as he restores harmony. The cost is modest (exertion and psychic strain rather than a true sacrifice), which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious package → decision to descend → library ghosts’ unending distress → insertion of lens → beam fires → ghosts released → earned quiet. The story maintains a single, coherent scene with backstory nested efficiently and closure delivered through a clear decisive act that changes the status of the spirits and the signal. Cost is present in the three-day journey and his exhaustion, but it’s largely summarized rather than dramatized, so the climax feels somewhat frictionless—nothing meaningfully resists his plan once he reaches the atrium. Still, the drive lens (causal with light textural layering) holds firmly through to a legible, satisfying after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and linear: sanctions → smuggling run → ritual consecration → distribution and watch. Causality is coherent and the orientation (who/where/when) is established early and held without confusion. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise in Elara’s continued vigil, with the bell’s weight signifying duty. However, there’s only a mild tightening of pressure rather than a decisive turn; the night’s run proceeds without complication, keeping the arc from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: past-life memory → journey to the viaduct → encounter with the ghost → diagnostic use of the Tear → decision to channel unused love → conceptual realization about love as action. The piece delivers a clear closure unit via conceptual repricing (unused love as fuel, not stored substance) with on-page cost (his chest feels lighter, pressure reduced). Structure is tight, with one continuous scene framed by concise backstory that tilts the present action. Escalation is somewhat gentle and assured rather than precarious, which keeps it from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: condition → plan → construction of the hyperbolic maze → insertion of the halo fragment → dissolution of the memories → tactile experience of “now.” The structure is a single continuous scene with steadily intensifying action, and the closure is a decisive change with a clear before/after. Cost is present conceptually (his imprisoning memories are destroyed), but the story tilts so hard toward triumph that it underplays any bittersweet loss, keeping the structural arc effective but not fully complex.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: the wall comes down, the mob breaches, Elias decodes the keys, initiates the vault seal, and uses the arrow to complete it just as looters arrive. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the vault is secured at the cost of Elias facing armed intruders while chained. Structure is tight within a single scene, with no orientation issues or broken rules. Escalation is somewhat linear and predictable, but the linkage and final cost are convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: preparation → harvesting silences → imprinting, all building toward the device’s completion. Causality is clean and orientation is excellent, with no confusion about where or when we are or what she’s doing. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: once the imprint is complete, the world now contains a device that hears betrayal, with the cost implied in the phrase “grim harvest” and the presence of the dead. The main limitation is that the structural turn is more procedural than dramatic, so the final shift, while satisfying, feels intellectually more than narratively costly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: golden-hour theft → enforced wait → moonlit development → revelation that the subject is looking at her. Causality is coherent (flower-code causes waiting; moonlight enables development; development enables revelation) and the accumulative drive toward a conceptual reweighting is well handled. Closure lands as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s understanding of her work and destiny is altered, with options implicitly reconfigured. The cost and forward implications are more implied than dramatized, which holds this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: the melt destabilizes the tower, forcing Elias to choose between staying with his perfected tools or abandoning them to bring his domes to the valley. Orientation is clean from the opening line (who/where/when are quickly legible), and the single-scene structure is well contained. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: he leaves the largest, most perfect dome behind, knowingly sacrificing the “static safety” he’s spent a decade building. The before/after of shelter-as-refuge vs. shelter-as-tomb is stark and earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: fire countdown → need for override → discovery and decryption of the cast → inversion of sanctuary protocols → Julian trapped outside, Elias enclosed. The five-minute clock and seashell taunts structure the scene cleanly, and each beat arises from the prior one. Closure is decisive and motivated: the environment literally flips from exposed to sealed, with a clear before/after and cost. The puzzle solution edges on convenient but is sufficiently grounded in his obsessive attention and the relic’s history.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual under a ticking cosmic clock (the last star), building toward the completion of the map as closure; causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent. Her tactic—summarizing silence into a map—emerges logically from the premise that speaking would feed the wind, and the ending’s decisive change (star extinguishes, map complete, storm vanishes) lands clearly with conceptual cost. The before/after of “unmapped end” versus “mapped end she is ready to walk into” is legible and satisfying. A minor limitation is that intermediate beats feel more like steady elaborations of the conceit than structural turns that meaningfully change her options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, contiguous scene: assess the mess → identify focal object → perform consolidation → dispose of violin. Causality and stakes are coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: the need to clear the courtyard and his ongoing quest drive each beat. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he performs the miracle, fails (again) to find the origin of thought, and reaffirms his role as janitor. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic but legible—the potential insight is literally dropped into the recycler.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scene is cleanly structured: accusation/pressure, reveal of the strange method, experiential proof via the tickets, then shared responsibility and restored trust. Causality is firm under a mostly causal lens—each move (show tickets, verify echo, hand Mara the lens, her choice to look) leads to the next. Closure is on-page and legible: their relationship status changes and the “crime” becomes a shared burden with an implied cost to both. The only limit is that the institutional stakes (risk to his position) stay backgrounded rather than concretely tested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the luck gauge declares death, Elian performs his ritual, the refracted light revives the vine, and this visible result conceptually undercuts the system’s premise. The piece holds a consistent causal lens while also accumulating texture toward a closure that reprices “luck” versus care. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final statement about broken tools reframes both Elian’s past deception and the gauge’s authority with clear conceptual cost to the world’s ideology. Structure is straightforward single-scene with no orientation debt or major unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: long preparation → device activation → witnessing the Weavers move sideways in time → temptation → decision to stay and hide the truth. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure fits the scope and drives to a coherent Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. The cost is present—he forecloses the option of becoming a “traveler of the lateral seconds” in favor of secrecy—but underplayed in concrete consequences. The structure feels complete and publishable, though a slightly sharper articulation of what he stands to lose by crossing would deepen the ending’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal: obsession → experimental method → supernatural stillness → disruptive kick → revealed map → podium search → hidden box → baton and closure. The drive lens reads Hybrid, with causal beats carried on a thick textural atmosphere, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the haunting drive resolves into a completed “conversation” at a psychic cost. Setups (the Maestro’s disappearance, pit as liminal, the program) all pay off, and there are no causality breaks or unkept promises. The stakes remain intimate rather than catastrophic, but for this scope the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: fever breaks → recall of hidden catastrophe → decision to manipulate margins → smudge → model destabilization → acceptance of burden, with clear because/therefore links. Orientation (who/where/when) is established almost immediately and never wavers. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he reconfigures the system and accepts solitary foreknowledge as the new equilibrium. The only cap on a higher score is that the on-page “test” of the new state remains conceptual rather than dramatized in further consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous causal sequence from tunnel exploration to radio confession to the mill’s “awakening” and Silas’s revaluation. The central drive (seeking an answer about negligence vs. malice) coheres with the physical investigation of the valve and the supernatural machinery echo. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional shift rather than an event twist, but it’s legible and carries cost. A slightly sharper on-page test of physical danger or a more explicit moment where he nearly chooses differently could have intensified the structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from library → rising threat → origami transit → obsidian refuge with no causality breaks. The subterranean river swelling provides a credible tightening that motivates the transition without melodrama. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she resituates herself as observer at the end of stories, foreclosing further intervention with a conceptual cost (abandoning the living archive) that’s legible but gently felt. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and interior, so the sense of irreversible consequence is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: preparation on the ridge → waiting for the eclipse window → pairing the hair curl with music and eclipse → Elara’s brief reconnection and the session’s end. The piece uses a Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative atmosphere), and the closure—Elara’s eyes retaining light after the eclipse—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a modest but legible cost (this is temporary, hard-won, and fragile). Structure is linear and focused on one scene with clear before/after, no orientation debt, and no dangling setups. The main ceiling is that the “ordinary magic” framework is explained rather than fully dramatized, which softens the sense of stakes paid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: Elian enters, senses a focal wound, investigates, understands, and leaves, with the tapestry/diary reveal anchoring closure. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each discovery deepens the central concept rather than generating reversals. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the tapestry and silo are reweighted as memorial and released witnesses, though the personal and situational cost remains abstract. The piece could reach higher if Elian’s realization tangibly altered his options or stance beyond quiet completion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one scene framed by a concise backstory pulse, leading causally from prophetic mishaps → unease → decision → execution via the lighthouse beam. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: he resigns from the network and redefines the light’s function, with a clear before/after. The prophetic incidents that trigger the shift are recounted rather than staged, which slightly flattens escalation and makes the turn feel more intellectual than pressured. Cost at closure is more implied (abandoning a dangerous role) than concretely dramatized, keeping this just below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single, causal exorcism scene: Kellen identifies the threat, deploys his method in escalating layers, and achieves a decisive change when Elias is freed and the Vantablack becomes mundane paint. Orientation is strong from the opening: who, where, what’s at stake, and the physical focal object are all clear. Closure is solid and on-page, with a clear before/after in both Elias and the palette. The main weakness is that the entity never counter-moves or complicates Kellen’s plan, so the path from problem to solution feels relatively unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that accumulates pressure toward dawn, with every step (drawing memories, testing the shell, waiting for the mirrored horizon) causally feeding the final “conducting” moment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he briefly resolves his temporal ache and fulfills the fortune he’s written for himself, with an implied cost in the extremity and ephemerality of the experience. Drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with clear internal logic and no orientation debt. The stakes are modest but coherent, keeping it just short of the very highest structural band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear drive—follow the tablet’s sequence to the maze’s center and fuse the timelines. Because/therefore links are strong (trusting the tablet → path appears; tablet completes its function → crumbles → she must choose gravity unaided), and the closure beat is an on-page decisive change with cost. The droplet’s fall is an effective structural clock whose payoff coincides with the fusion of timelines. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues despite the abstract setting.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene that tightens steadily under an accumulative/textural lens, from descent to setup to needle drop to emotional break. Causality is coherent—backward play with a broken needle in a resonant cavern leads to the filament of hush, tightening pressure, and eventual catharsis. Closure is strong and legible as a resonant reconfiguration: numbness is replaced by painful aliveness at clear emotional cost. A minor limitation is that the risk of enthrallment is raised but never quite tested with a concrete choice, slightly softening the peak turn.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent: being followed → bolting the gate → pigeon arrival → gate assault → lateral escape → vantage on destruction and new resolve. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she loses her station but preserves data and the mysterious message, recommitting to her role as recorder in a city under siege. The structure is cleanly one scene with rising pressure, though the pursuers remain faceless instruments of plot rather than active forces that force a more complex decision.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: arrival and setup, activation of the UV emitter, the Lily’s transformation, then inhalation and emotional collapse. Causality is tight—her hypothesis demands visual confirmation, which demands UV, which forces the mask removal that triggers the breakdown and realization about scent as “chemical ghost.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a large external turn: she verifies her theory at the cost of being re-marked by her father’s presence and acknowledging that memory can be confirmed but not recovered. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, but the causal links are strong and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: descent → ritual setup → disturbance of time → crisis choice → renunciatory exit, with strong causal links (the spiral and scraping cause the temporal thickening and rope-strain). Closure is an Earned Stasis: he forecloses transcendence and chooses limitation, with the prison rope as the decisive constraint. Stakes and options are legible at the decision point, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues. A slightly sharper external repercussion—however small—for disturbing time could have amplified the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: fire-lighting → gathering → performance that pushes against the hush → resonant, unresolved ending. Causality is coherent (her act of playing, guided by her hearing, provokes the dome’s resonance and shifts the silence’s meaning), and the accumulative/textural drive is well maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silence becomes “a canvas” rather than a void, with communal cost and relief legible on the page. The piece could gain further by making the pre-performance risk or potential failure of the ritual more concretely contingent on on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s panic → Silas’s preparation → administration of the formula → observable transformation with a clear before/after. Single-scene structure and spatial orientation are strong, and the closure (her altered state, his completed transaction) lands with a legible cost. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture, and it holds. The only limiting factor is that the procedure unfolds without any substantial complication or on-page risk, muting structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mistaken envelope → Elias’s decision to track her down → delivery → shifted relationship as they sit to talk. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous scene with a brief but well-anchored backstory insert. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines “currency” and acts on a new/affirmed value system. The only thing holding it from higher is that the decisive change is modest and largely internal, without a strongly felt cost beyond overcoming shyness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: desire to belong → joining the ritual → boy’s injury → comforting him → finding the tag → weaving the response → tactile acceptance. The single-scene structure is coherent and the closure beat—her inclusion in the kinship web—is on the page with a clear before/after. Stakes remain modestly scaled and there’s little sense of real jeopardy, which keeps the arc from feeling fully incisive. Still, for a quiet piece, the structural execution is tight and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: rooftop journey → time pressure from the giant’s nap → activation of the pendant → ascent and uncaging of the echo → sketching under collapsing stasis → escape as the city/giant wakes. The dominant drive (get the echo before waking) holds clearly under a Causal lens and culminates in earned closure with cost. The time-borrow mechanic is introduced before its payoff and never contradicted, and the final image (aged Elara escaping with her masterpiece as the city roars) lands as a clean resolution. Structure is essentially one continuous, escalating scene with no orientation debt or dangling set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear and clean: preparation → ritual → partial vision → recalibrated stance, all within one continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the loss remains unresolved, but the new “data point” (the meadow) reweights his quest and options at a conceptual cost. There are no serious orientation issues or broken set-ups; everything introduced (orchard, mosaic, eyes, moonlight) participates in the ritual’s outcome. Escalation is modest but coherent, building from description into an experiment whose failure-success hybrid is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: blackout → silence → debris rattle → investigation → tape discovery → plan → risky placement → her discovery and his internal shift. It’s a single continuous scene with no orientation debt, and every beat logically follows the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his isolation is reweighted by her reaction and her upward gaze. Stakes are modest but coherent to the frame; nothing essential feels missing or conveniently patched.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: accidental exposure → escalating symptoms and failed control → suffocating greenhouse → storm-yard collapse → realization that resistance kills → surrender. The piece maintains a single POV and largely continuous scene with one clear spatial transition, and the final act of dropping the leaf lands as a decisive change with cost. No orientation issues; time and space remain legible. The structure is straightforward rather than daring, but very solid for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: toxic squall → following rain → forbidden overhang → unearthed tunnel → scavenger encounter → exchange → reframed insomnia. The piece lands a clear closure unit (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) in his decision to sacrifice survival for symbolic time and to reframe sleeplessness as vigil. Orientation (who/where/when) is early and solid, and the single-scene structure suits the scope. The only limiter is that the macro-arc remains relatively compact rather than architecturally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: Kael’s arrival and offering causally lead to the overlapping-shadows trigger, the inhabiting of the pearl, and Elara’s conceptual repricing of what “fate” means. The single-scene frame is coherent and easy to follow, with no orientation debt. Closure lands in her changed stance toward the pilgrim and the world, with the pearl as a continuing cost/reminder. The main limit is that some beats (e.g., the entity’s nature and motivation) are explained in summary rather than dramatized through more concrete, escalating action.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single continuous scene with strong orientation (who/where/when are all clear early) and a causal throughline: storm → arrival → silence → Elian’s perception → valve insertion → sonic sequence → communal shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor moves from fracture and silence to murmurs and weeping, directly due to Elian’s intervention. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural but causality is intact, with each step naturally following the prior one. The main limitation is the relatively low on-page cost; everything works on the first try with no meaningful resistance or consequence beyond exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: cracks → train yard → ravine → staircase → jar, with no orientation issues and a clear single scene. The drive lens is predominantly causal, with each fantastical element introduced before it’s needed. Closure lands solidly with the decisive act of breaking the jar and integrating her truth. The main limitation is that obstacles are relatively frictionless, so the path can feel a bit too smooth for the weight of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival with a practical archiving task, encounter with the tile and maps, entangled memories as the turn, and a reoriented departure that closes the emotional and conceptual arc. Causality is accumulative rather than driven by sharp reversals, but the progression from data-copying to memory-anchoring is coherent under a textural lens. The speculative mechanism of how the tile generates memories is deliberately under-explained yet consistent enough not to break the story’s internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: the solar storm provides power, his dimensional awareness and will harness it through magnetic fields into the amulet, which cracks, opens the fissure, redefines his understanding of “after,” and leads directly to his decision to step through. The piece reads primarily under a Causal lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure: his realization that “the ‘after’ was not a place to inhabit, but a frequency” reframes death and immortality with real cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early enough despite the exotic setting, and the climax and dissolution are dramatized rather than summarized. The cost—surrendering immortality—is legible on the page and shapes the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Vance’s arrival → Julian’s offer of the ink → the act of signing → transformed decision, with a clear before/after in Vance’s stance toward Elena. The scene is well-contained in one location and time, and closure is decisive: Elena gets temporary protection, Vance is shaken, Julian considers the ledger balanced. The cost is legible—Vance breaches his own rigid identity and retreats, horrified by his newfound softness. The magic ink is a late-revealed but foreshadowed mechanism, and while convenient, it doesn’t break causality within the story’s terms.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual from ascent to descent, with escalating precision leading to a completed artifact and quiet closure. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step in the process (setup, activation, hum shift, precarious timing, completion) coheres logically and builds toward the final touch of her finger on the page. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the forged sheet now carries a “ghost” that slightly redefines the premise. Stakes remain modest and largely professional/abstract, keeping the piece out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: discover object → apply method → install as monument → reaffirm role, forming a clear before/after in the label’s status and the day’s work. Causality is soft but consistent with a textural drive; each step flows from the narrator’s method rather than arbitrary turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: trash becomes a charged memorial, and the world’s criteria for “validity” are quietly inverted. The main limitation is the low narrative pressure—no real obstacle or threatening counterforce ever tests or complicates the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: prepare device → invoke resonance → truth-compass manifests → forced confrontation → final acceptance. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new phenomenon (compass, reimagined conversations, rattling shell) deepening the same drive rather than side-questing. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: Elias accepts that the “riddle has no answer, only a song,” and that his role has inverted. The cost—abandoning his lifelong stance and facing his self-deceptions as the universe ends—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal drive is clean: impending privatization → need to invalidate maps → covert reconfiguration → relocation of the foundation stone. The ticking clock (surveyors at dawn) and the graffiti-encoded commands give a legible chain of because/therefore actions. Closure lands with a decisive change and a charged final stance: the city’s logic has been rewritten, and Elara stands ready to face the “new landlords.” The main limitation is that opposition remains offstage, so resistance meets little on-page pushback beyond time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene with a clear temporal drive toward the mirror activation and a satisfying before/after split. Causality is tight—his need for stealth forces chemical timing, which leads into the “dawning hush” beat and then the mirror flare—and there are no orientation issues. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he succeeds in his goal, but the world irreversibly changes, and the photo’s weight replaces the lost night. The stakes are modest but fully coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation and causal flow are excellent: we understand the depot, the shop, the courier’s arrival, the broken drone, the diagnostic method, the repair, and the launch in a clean sequence. The causal chain (broken drone → diagnosis → adjustment → firmware patch → successful relaunch before the airship departs) holds solidly under a Causal lens. Closure lands as a quiet RR: the drone is restored and sent out, the ship departs, and Elias returns to his calm, slightly recharged solitude. The main limitation is the lack of on-page setback or complication; the problem resolves smoothly without a structural “pinch” that would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear orientation, a signal (falcon), a method (condensation map), a realization, and a closing choice. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds from eerie stillness to the falcon’s arrival to the condensation’s impossible behavior, culminating in a conceptual repricing of where “rivers” begin. Closure lands on-page with Silas deciding not to record the discovery and “finally” close the book, marking a before/after in his quest. The cost and change are more conceptual than dramatic, which fits the mode but keeps the piece just shy of feeling fully decisive in a narrative sense.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: discord builds under the archway, Silas intervenes, the footsteps align, the arch stabilizes, and he recommits to his vigil. The accumulative/textural drive (noise → groan → rhythm → hum) holds consistently and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the city’s balance is briefly restored at visible risk. Causality is clear at this scale—he waits, then acts, which alters the environment and options. The cost and inevitability of future collapse are legible, giving the ending a charged poise rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival in the temple → retrieval and handling of the vial (with psychic bleed) → mechanical obstacle at the altar → unsnarling under a ticking oxygen clock → successful broadcast and death. Closure is strong Earned Stasis: she deliberately trades her life for the signal, and the story lands this cost on the page. Structure is straightforward and well-contained in one scene, though the “distress signal” idea could be more tightly contrasted between expected personal rescue and actual ancestral broadcast to heighten the structural irony.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine holds: ignored warning → wreck → looming blame → metaphysical escape, ending in a clean Charged Poise/Decisive Change when Elian vanishes. The prison’s impossible geometry and the lattice are introduced early enough to support the later escape without feeling like a last-minute rule change. The cost is mostly conceptual—self-erasure and an unresolved external disaster—yet legible. Escalation is relatively smooth rather than sharply stepped, but the closure beat is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Julian enters with the bead → activates the greenhouse → summons the ghost bride → trades the bead for his cure → loses the bond. Closure is solidly on the page with a clear before/after (terminally ill and bound vs. cured and alone) and a visible emotional cost. The single-scene structure is tight and oriented quickly, with no confusing temporal or spatial shifts. The main limitation is that the path to resolution feels relatively unopposed—once the ghost appears, there’s little doubt or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: orientation lands early, then we move through one contained night of work toward a visible closure where the fissure is “pulled tight and healed.” Causality is coherent under a mostly accumulative/situational lens—her prior salvaging of the plate informs her current rebellion, the orchid solace enables the trance, and the trance enables the sewing. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city shifts from ruin to “tapestry,” with a concrete scar as proof. The main limitation is the lack of an acute turning point or complication; the trajectory feels steady rather than sharply tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival and orientation, discovery of the sundial, decision to rebuild, week-long labor, and activation of the restored dial culminating in an emotional resolution. Causality holds under a largely accumulative, lyric lens, with the sundial’s discovery and repair logically emerging from her root-following method. Closure is clear—a decisive act (rebuilding) and conceptual repricing (time and ancestry resume) with emotional cost registered as sustained effort and vulnerability. The main limitation is that obstacles remain soft; the process never truly threatens failure or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: chalk-code signal → decoding → composition of the letter and identity → approach to the chute, all in a single continuous scene. Causality is straightforward and coherent, and the closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—Elian stands poised to send a dangerous letter into the physical system. However, the dominant drive is accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal; the “rush” never meaningfully alters tactics, and the implied world-scale stakes (dismantling a data center) are not tested on the page. The cost at closure is mostly conceptual, not dramatized as a shift in options or danger, which keeps this below elite-level immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s demand and deadline force Lysa into action, her secret motive drives the subversion of the map, and the finished embroidery creates a new option for the Chancellor’s side. The scene maintains tight focus in one location with one primary drive, and the ending clearly reconfigures the situation (the coup will now be contested) with a conceptual cost. Closure lands via a decisive completed act and a charged final image. Stakes are largely projected into the future rather than partially sampled in-scene, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Julian seeks Elara → ritual with the gargoyle under moonlight → message appears and vanishes → he leaves with a reconfigured understanding and a new intention. The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: he doesn’t change the past but decisively shifts his stance toward the present (“ready to write the letter he should have sent years ago”). Structure is tight in a single scene with no orientation issues, and the world’s small magical rules (moonlight healing, condensation messages) are used consistently. The only limitation is that the final decision is almost frictionless, with little on-page resistance at the moment of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal/accumulative structure is coherent: anesthetic → solitude with the cast → decoding → decision to rewrite → revised object and internal shift. Orientation is clear early on (sanatorium atrium, post-operation wait, who Leo is) and maintained throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cast’s meaning and Elias’s role as translator are reweighted, with a before/after legible in his breathing and readiness. Stakes are modest and entirely internal, but the piece delivers the promised turn without structural slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: studio → daydream entry → discovery/experiment → climax of the light-orchard → fade → return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she recovers her stance toward art with a felt cost in the work’s ephemerality. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the piece honors that, though the stakes remain small-scale and introspective. There are no orientation issues, and every step follows logically from the last.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: coin toss → resonant ping → nested awakenings → conceptual shift → altered reply, all contained within the “microscopic pause.” The mosaic of mural, boxcar, and pure-geometry selves is legible and escalates in abstraction while returning coherently to the garden frame. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: Elian’s understanding of “truth” and his professional stance are reweighted with a sense of cost—the “heavy coat of knowing” is shed. The only limitation is that the pressure is mostly philosophical rather than situational, which slightly softens the felt stakes of each awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: oppressive tax regime → greenhouse as scanner shield → arrival for mission → raid escalation → use of the seed to crash the system, ending in a clear before/after state. The backstory about garden message patterns is integrated enough to justify why this particular place and moment matter, though it remains more explanatory than dramatically tested. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing when the tax ledger blinks to nothing, with a felt conceptual cost in the prior sacrifices (twelve men). Structure is tight and linear within one scene, with no orientation or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build from contemplation to ritual to renunciation, with each step causally linked (song → growth → decision to inter the postcard). Orientation is immediate: Elias, the shell, the postcard, the ancient war all lock quickly into place, and the lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout. Closure lands when he ensconces the postcard, his hands “finally empty,” and the internal state is reconfigured: no longer a prisoner of sorrow but an awake gardener. The cost—relinquishing his last physical tie to the lover/war—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: a dimming orchid leads to the cracked chime, which demands a specialized repair, restoring harmony and re-securing the names. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early, and the single-scene structure holds under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library is briefly stabilized, but the cost—Elian’s endless, likely un-witnessed vigilance—is made legible. Escalation is modest but coherent, with no broken set-ups or arbitrary turns.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong: emotional stalemate → Elara’s deliberate triggering of volatile magic → escalating magical chaos → re-stabilization through vows → relational shift. The piece uses a single, coherent scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors, and the magic’s behavior is consistently tied to the truth theme. Closure lands as a decisive change in the relationship, with an on-page cost in risk and vulnerability. The mechanism of the spell resolving once promises are spoken is a bit convenient but adequately foreshadowed by the nature of Veritas Aeterna.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: deciphered adhesive → discovery of bypass → need for a mechanical workaround → timed intervention during the building’s “breath” → successful deception of sensors. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when), and the narrative maintains a single, continuous scene with one coherent drive. Closure lands as a decisive change—water diverted, gauges lying—with a clear before/after in both the system and Elian’s status as a traitor in secret. The only limitation is that the emotional repercussion of success is kept relatively conceptual rather than being pressure-tested by an additional on-page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear inciting intrusion (her arrival with the paper trail), explanation of the meteorite’s need, a decision point, and the release of the bird as closure. Causality is coherent—her tracking him via the margins forces him to confront exposure and choose whether to proceed and with whom. The closure is a quiet resonant reconfiguration (he accepts shared hope over total secrecy), but the cost and risk on the page feel modest, limiting impact. The drive reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival on the terrace → engagement with the desk and wood grain → discovery of the logbook → conceptual revelation → choice to restore distance, forming a coherent causal/accumulative arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets sacred thresholds as warnings and makes a decisive shift in strategy, with the “first intentional gap” as a clear before/after marker. The surreal mechanism of reading time from wood grain is asserted rather than justified, but in the established fabulist mode it doesn’t break causality or the drive lens. Stakes and sequence are legible throughout, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: descent already done, time-boxed viewing window, bioluminescent “event,” then a closing choice with cost. Causality under an accumulative/lyric lens is solid—Kael’s tuning enables the display, the display triggers Elara’s emotional shift, which leads to placing the feather on the console. Closure as resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing is legible: before she clings to a ruined sky-identity; after she consents to a new, submerged map of belonging. Stakes remain modest and interior, but they are coherent and fully resolved within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: bird → seeds → glass → flawed projection → conjecture → revelation, all within one continuous scene. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end (reframing the vanished civilization as ambient vibration). Closure lands: her long-term motivation is answered and the world is reconfigured in a way that clearly changes her understanding. The main limitation is that the time-pressure and "risk" of conjecture never truly threaten failure or a meaningful downside, so the climax feels slightly low-cost for the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is exceptionally clean: tide → vibration → bishop → can → machine → woman’s stumble → payout → emotional lift. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the single-scene structure is tight and coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s project succeeds, the woman’s mood shifts, and the bishop’s fall marks the event’s completion. The only limitation is the relatively low-scale cost; nothing in the structure truly tests or endangers his drive.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: preparation in the garden, performance of the inscription, then departure, with clear because/therefore causality. Closure is solid: she completes the irreversible crime and commits to exile, an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid with visible stakes. The structure is mostly accumulative in texture, but the ritual’s “spontaneously anchored” moment and the act of leaving the gate give legible turns. A touch more on-page friction (e.g., an actual near-interruption by drones or a faltering in the ritual) would sharpen escalation without needing more length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure: anticipation at dawn, ritual consultation, interpretation, and payoff when the light hits the atrium. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual and the shifting light deepen rather than sharply turn the situation, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “fractures” and “trash.” Closure lands on the page: he redefines his role with visible conceptual cost (relinquishing the fantasy of fixing the world). The arc is coherent and satisfying, but the pressure and cost remain relatively soft, keeping it below top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: hike → arrival at peak → reflective reframe of fire and pain → scattering of soot as a culminating act. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens: his reflections about combustion lead directly to the emotional shift that enables release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his pain is conceptually redistributed to the universe, and that change is legible and felt. Stakes and situation are clear from early on; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Elian prepares the balloon, encodes hope, launches it, and the world’s gray entropy recedes as a direct consequence. The single-scene arc is easy to follow, with the gauge and balloon providing clear orientation and progress markers. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—the world is revitalized and the present “feels heavier and more real”—but the cost of success is minimal or abstract, which limits impact. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with a causal backbone, and that pattern is held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and causal: corridor → acoustic reading → library → hearth → diaries → film → decision to carry them out. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never in doubt, and the professional procedure (clicker, echo map) motivates each deeper move into the ruin. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the echoes are reinterpreted as betrayal, and Elias’s role redefines from surveyor to burden-bearer with conceptual cost. The main limitation is that the final decision (to take the materials) follows naturally but without a sharpened fork in the road, so the climax feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: rain → droplets → lullaby and heartbeat → mirage → bell toll breaking the effect, with the man’s reaction as closure. The live clock of the cathedral bell provides a strong structural spine and the story maintains orientation and focus in a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in the man’s stance and options, plus a mild Resonant Reconfiguration of what mirrors can be. The main limitation is that the cost of the magic and the risks to Elara remain conceptually underdeveloped, keeping the structural stakes moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clear: celestial interference creates a narrow window, Kaelen uses that constraint to stage a ritual that culminates in a binding treaty. The scene is continuous, tightly focused, and the closure—a signed peace grounded in personal loss—is unquestionably on the page with cost. The story maintains its drive without digressions, and the before/after of the war’s terms is legible. A slightly more contested midpoint (more pushback before yielding names) could further heighten structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece uses a simple but effective structure: arrival on the salt flat, reading the “map,” placing the egg, then departure under the approaching storm. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: his past actions shape the present wasteland, which in turn shapes this small, quixotic corrective. Closure lands in the quiet hinge of leaving the egg and the first drop of rain, a clear reconfiguration with cost. There are no major structural or orientation slips, though the escalation is more tonal than event-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the Harvest of Echoes will drain the Prism, so Elara must reach it and undo the binding before the Magistrates complete the ritual, culminating in her decisive act of snapping the anchor thread and reversing the Harvest. The story maintains a single, coherent scene with clear spatial and temporal orientation, and closure lands firmly with a Decisive Change that reconfigures the world order. Cost is legible in both the risk (soul-destruction) and the aftermath (Magistrates shattered, city thrown into chaotic freedom). The main structural limitation is that obstacles are relatively soft—guards are conveniently distracted and no intermediate setback complicates her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: argument → artistic response → reversal performance → quiet, conceptually reweighted ending. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—each beat logically follows as Silas escalates his rebuttal through form, not speech. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image (“listening for echoes of things that never happened” and “written a truth by erasing a lie”) redefines what constitutes a moral ending, with a clear before/after stance. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible: he rejects the comfort of linear moral punishment, leaving the audience (and heckler) in charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a single, continuous scene with clean causal flow: arrival, construction, discovery of the moth wing, monarch’s landing, then his departure. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, with each new image (knot, wing, monarch, sky color) tightening toward the final conceptual repricing of extinction as interrupted cadence and anonymous loss. Closure is strong: the knowledge that the structure will fall and scatter both king and commoner recasts all prior ritual as a costly, deliberate ephemerality. A slight limitation is that the on-page “turn” is quiet and more reflective than situationally forced, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and linear: set-up (goal and object) → method (rope/furnace) → execution (pour) → result (bronze card, emotional closure). Causality is solid and easy to follow, and the closure (a successful casting that reconfigures his grief) is legible with cost. The main limitation is a lack of complicating turns—everything works on the first try, so escalation feels modest. Still, for a single-scene piece, the arc from preparation to completion is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: approach of the storm → interaction with decaying AI → dream-vision of the box → waking search → discovery, seal-breaking, and lever-pull. Causality is coherent and anchored in her relationship with the Steward and the storm; the dream mechanism is convenient but sufficiently prepped and integrated. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—she opens the bunker to the storm, sacrificing its “safety” for a charged, self-chosen end. The drive reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative, held consistently to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: imminent conquest creates urgency → ascent and preparation → geometric ritual → entity’s acknowledgement → covenant sealed just as the new era breaches the gates. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, and the single scene structure is tight. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: knowledge is now preserved beyond physical reach, while Bel-ibni accepts the city’s fall and his limited role. The cost is conceptual and situational rather than dramatic, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: sanctuary set-up, confrontation, object reversal (knocked away/returns), forced contact, internal crisis, and a decisive change with the sword dropping and cylinder departing. Causality is tight under a Causal lens, with each beat arising from the prior: silence → need for cellular memory → use of the cylinder → Kaelen’s reconfigured stance. Closure is strong and on-page; the “before/after” of Kaelen is unmistakable and carries cost. If anything, the outcome feels slightly foreordained, with minimal sense that Elian’s plan might fail.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene with a clear before/after (rotted orchard vs. world of glass and realized cathedral). Causality is sound under an accumulative/textural lens: his grounding, the sextant, and synchronized breathing all compound to loosen physics and solidify the dream. Closure lands on-page as a decisive environmental transformation with concept cost (the world becoming glass), though the personal price is relatively light and uncomplicated. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/what he wants are legible), and there are no causality lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: contracted orchard → breach via mis-specified vows → dangerous rift → failed standard repair → desperate rummaging → ribbon insight and hinge-solution. The story holds a single scene with an increasingly volatile problem and lands a clear closure unit (she redefines “repair” as cyclical, not permanent) that reconfigures the initial premise with conceptual cost. The cost—risking herself on the beam and surrendering a precious memento—is legible without being overstated. Structure is tight and there are no dangling setups or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight: sensory overwhelm → bathroom reflection → time-loop exposition → confrontation with the orchard → realization → choice, all in one continuous causal flow. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with an accumulative/conceptual ending: the orchard’s nature and the timebook metaphor reweight everything at closure. Closure is a clear Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he forecloses alternate futures by deciding what face to carve, with the cost of self-ensnarement in the loop. There are no orientation issues and no broken causal links, though one more concrete beat testing the risk of “wrong face” could further sharpen the structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: Traveler’s incursion → mountain’s “immune” response → Elara follows the diary → negotiates entry → rescues and escapes, with the mountain resettling afterward. The drive lens is Causal with a clear closure: the rescue succeeds and the mountain reconfigures its stance once its catalog is improved, with the visible cost of the Traveler’s aging and forced study of his failures. Structure is tight—a single descent and return—without wasted beats or unkept setups. The main weakness is that the escape sequence is cursory and frictionless, so the climax resolves a bit too quickly once the golem yields.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: goal → boarding the ship → navigating with narrative threads → reaching the Garden → revising the goal into acceptance. Causality is legible even within the accumulative, slightly surreal mode (her stated method of “speaking her path” pays off in the manifested door). Closure reads as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: she reaches the fabled place and chooses not to force a separation. Stakes are modestly scaled and internal, but there is a clear before/after and a real path foreclosed (the dreamed-of conversation with a distinct sister).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: plague of forgetting → discovery of the rope → application of the wax seal → merging the timelines, with no orientation issues. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change: the university’s history is restored and the impossible door closes. However, the middle reads almost as a foregone conclusion; Elian encounters no meaningful resistance, setback, or doubt, so escalation feels more procedural than pressured. The cost is limited to secrecy and effort, which keeps the structural arc solid but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is excellent: we know who she is, where she is, what the threat is, and what she wants within the opening. The causal chain is clean and legible: invaders’ sonic assault → retreat to deeper cavern → read ice fractures → position artifact → activate counter-song → bloom of hush → collapse into silence. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change (threat neutralized) coupled with an earned stasis (she can finally rest), with an on-page cost in strain and the stone’s dimming. The structure is simple—one continuous scene without an unexpected reversal—but well-scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: find prism → recognize hush → ascend and align → silence bubble → urgent rekindling → successful signal. Closure is strong and on-page: the world now has a visible pillar of light and Elara’s belief in pattern is validated, a clear before/after reconfiguration. The cost—risk of failure under a time constraint as the silence may collapse, and the emotional extremity of acting alone for a thousand-year cycle’s culmination—is present, if not dwelt on. Structure stays focused in a single scene with no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from setup (lonely observatory, her task) to the forecourt ritual, to the measurement of shadows, to the interpretive decision and inscription. Causality under a textural lens holds: rain → voices → need to chronicle → measurement → interpretation → commitment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she reconceives the civilization’s identity and seals that stance in the chronicle, with a clear before/after. Stakes and costs remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through competing options, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival in a despairing fortress → discovery of the mosaic recipe → adjustment for humidity → ignition and display → emotional payoff and departure. Closure lands via a completed display that shifts the refugees’ state from hopeless to briefly hopeful (a modest Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid). Still, the pressure never truly threatens failure—no serious setback or complication tests his plan on the page. Structurally it’s sound and satisfying, but a bit too smooth for top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens: one extended pause in a conversation that culminates in a stance shift. The causal chain is simple but coherent—his declaration → her observational processing → her decision to let him go—and closure lands cleanly as an Earned Stasis/RR when she verbalizes release. Cost is legible in the foreseen solitary future and the relinquished legacy. Structure is tight and linear; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: preparation → inversion → ritual → manifestation → sealing → comedown, with clear causal sequence. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she exits with the captured silence and a concrete future plan that reweights her past trauma. Stakes and rules (gravity inversion window, method, object) are legible and internally consistent. The piece leans slightly accumulative/lyric, but the causal spine holds without gaps or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: intrusive whistle → dangerous silence → Kael’s fear → Elian’s decision to use the vial → altered atmosphere and emotional reset. The piece delivers a single, coherent scene with a clear before/after in both physical and psychic terms. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the same journey now has a fundamentally different quality and perceived risk. Stakes remain modestly scaled (no real possibility of disaster felt), which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: waterfall → orchard → mural activation → unstable hard-light stairs → throne before sunrise, all under a ticking clock. Orientation is solid from the first lines, and the stair projection’s instability provides a clear final tightening. Closure lands as a decisive change when she claims the Unclaimed Throne and averts destruction, with prior beats pointing directly to this outcome. The main limitation is that the solar-array incineration threat never quite tests her in a concrete near-failure; it remains just shy of fully weaponized.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: single scene, clear causal chain from arrival-with-ring to dropping-it, and a decisive, on-page change with cost. The inferred drive lens is Situational with causal underpinnings—pressure of the sanctuary + Elian’s presence forces a stance about staying on the “threshold.” Closure is strong: once she drops the ring and the threshold literally vanishes, the before/after is unambiguous and paid for emotionally. A small limit is that the demolition of the house and cutting of contact are told rather than embodied, so they don’t add additional on-page turns.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: the warning texts → recognition of a quantum promise → decision to volunteer → tactical use of the bolt → collapse into a diamond. Stakes and rules are well taught before the climax, and the closure (bolt sacrificed, diamond forged, farm saved) lands with a clear before/after. The drive lens is solidly causal and holds throughout, with no orientation or rule-breaking issues. The only thing keeping it from the 9-band is that the cost, while present, feels relatively contained and quickly stabilized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: enter archive → fit crank → attune by intuition → produce standing waves → shatter casing → broadcast confession, with no evident logic breaks. Orientation (who/where/when, and what the machine does) is established swiftly and clearly, and the single-scene structure tightens smoothly to a decisive climax. Closure is solid: the dynasty-defining myth is overturned on the page and the world’s before/after is legible, even if consequences aren’t shown. The only limiting factor is that the risk and potential fallout for Elian himself are gestured at rather than concretely tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: he decodes the program as ritual, performs the movements, reality liquefies, the pod appears, he pledges allegiance, unsnaps the strap, and transcends. The piece functions as a single continuous scene with one dominant drive and a clear Decisive Change at the end, with the cost framed as abandonment of past identity and vows. Structure is simple but effective; there is one coherent escalation rather than multiple reversals, which suits the length. The only limitation is that elements feel a touch pre-ordained—there’s little sense his plan might fail or branch into materially different outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: dust-reading → suspect file → hidden envelope → button and message → interpretive leap → addendum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias reframes the official narrative by inscribing a "hypothesis of love," accepting a degree of uncertainty as the cost. Stakes and turns are modest but proportionate to the length and mode, with no orientation or lens confusion. The only limit is that the escalation from curiosity to ethical risk is underplayed rather than sharply foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: missed rendezvous + hostile drone → need to improvise route → puddle-map navigation → lagoon hub → key-turn → network override. Drive lens reads as Causal, and closure lands decisively with on-page change (the screens flicker black and the truth reappears). The structure is linear and coherent with one major tightening at the failed handoff, though post-lagoon resistance is relatively light, making the climax feel slightly easy tactically. Cost is legible but more implied than dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: the machine’s activation triggers Elias’s response with the vested hush, culminating in a clear success that carries cost. Orientation (where/who/when) is promptly established, and the drive lens—causal with textural accumulation—is stable throughout. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: the valley is saved but at the price of ongoing, exhausting vigilance, articulated in the “endless cycle” and his shaking hands. The only limitation is that the massive cosmological stakes mostly stay conceptual, with the on-page threat localized to “crack the tectonic plates and bring the ceiling down.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: the hush arrives, the leaf’s message demands tribute, Silas builds the monument, prods the seed, and witnesses transformation, with a clear before/after. Causality is tight within an accumulative/lyric frame, and the closure image (ash re-seen as snow; prophecy of life continuing) functions as a resonant reconfiguration. Stakes remain modest and largely conceptual, but the requirement of tribute before sowing gives the sequence some narrative pressure. Nothing crucial is left hanging or retroactively patched.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: stopped clocks → maps → journey → failed bridge → vine swing → retrieval of compass → internal reframing, all in one coherent scene. The drive lens is primarily causal with a strong internal revaluation at the end, and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: he stands stranded, but with a new orientation to fate. Stakes (retrieving the compass vs. physical danger) progress without major gaps or conveniences, and the broken ladder is a credible mid-beat reversal. The final moment is conceptually satisfying, but the cost of being stranded is only lightly felt on the page, which holds this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Julian’s failed transmutation → his dissolution → Elara’s decision to alchemically “repair” his absence → the golden outline as conceptual redemption. Structure is linear, single-scene, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the invisible catastrophe becomes visible—lands clearly with cost in the form of irrevocable acceptance. The drive lens skews accumulative/textural but remains coherent, with each move layering density around the central act. Stakes are almost entirely internal, yet the story maintains focus without causality breaks or disorienting shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Elian arrives with a mission, uses his harp to draw out the spirit, confronts Thorne with the tooth and reframed memory, and this triggers the ghost’s release. The story maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues, and every step follows from the last. Closure is strong: Thorne undergoes a decisive change (self-reframing through laughter), and the world reconfigures (the gorge’s darkness lifts) with a felt cost captured in the “luminous ache.” The drive lens reads as causal with a thematic overlay, held consistently through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: wake from anesthesia → navigate forest via trauma responses → reach clearing → remove mask and endure beam, with each step causally or texturally tied to the last. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure clearly ratchets as the environment and his body’s responses intensify. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward pain and mercy is reweighted in the final image, with visible cost. A slight abstraction in how “solving” the equation operates doesn’t materially harm the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story is cleanly structured as one continuous ritual-like scene with clear causal progression: lens to immersion, to anchors, to metaphysical “unfastening,” to transcription. The closure—releasing the keeper’s memory and recording it—is on the page and legible as a before/after state for both the painting and Elian, with a modest but real cost. The accumulative drive (sensation thickening toward the release) is coherent and held through to the final quiet image. Stakes remain on an intimate, almost ceremonial plane, which caps the sense of structural urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: haunted site → diagnostic method → discovery of the jammed mainspring → manual engagement → lift descends and ghosts disperse. Orientation is excellent from the first sentence, and the scene maintains a single, coherent window in time and space. Closure is a solid Decisive Change: the stalled mechanism finally completes its cycle, reconfiguring the status of both ghosts and machine. The main limitation is that the “descending truth” is more gestured at than concretely costed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: desire → search for frost → application of bottled whisper → press activation → catastrophic rupture, with no real orientation issues. Closure is decisive (the library and world-order shatter, Silas falls) and the cost is explicit and on-page. The structure is essentially a single escalating operation with no dead beats, fitting the length very well. A minor limitation is how effortlessly the perfect system collapses, with little sense of resistance or contingency.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: storm threat → Elian’s contrarian response → preparation with mirrors and shard → projection → aftermath. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/conceptual lens: covering the mirrors and placing the shard directly produce the decisive projection, which reconfigures the dispute. Closure lands well as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Elian “wins” but remains burdened and unchanged in his grief. Stakes stay relatively contained (interpretive victory more than physical danger), which limits the impact slightly at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: encroaching metaphysical rust threatens the city → Elias applies a counterintuitive repair method with the philosopher’s chip → harmonic shockwave reverses the decay. The scene holds a single, coherent drive lens (causal with lyric overlay) and delivers a decisive change with legible stakes (the city’s “last lung”). Time pressure from the rust at the doors gives a functional tightening, and closure is on-page when the machine resumes and rust reverses. The main limitation is that the global reversal feels almost too clean and unpriced, with no residual complication or partial failure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: factory whistle → orientation to Silas’s goal → compass psychometry → descent → lagoon ritual → collection and exit, with no breaks in logic. Orientation is strong and early; we know who, where, and roughly when very quickly, and the single-scene structure is coherent. Closure lands via a successful, irreversible act—he opens the hinged awakening, harvests the impossible scent, and the world metaphorically reconfigures for him—though the felt cost is modest. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a textural overlay, and it holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: radio plea → retrieval and interpretation of the slide → reimagining the sculpture → projection that turns the ship. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and stable, and the piece maintains a single, continuous scene with a tight external drive (save the freighter). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: the ship is saved and Elara returns to her turbine trance, now charged by the success of her “alliance across time.” The only limitation is that cost and jeopardy remain somewhat abstract; the solution works almost too smoothly, with little sense that failure was genuinely possible in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with light backstory leading causally to the viewing and internal revaluation, working well under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure—a conceptual repricing where she reinterprets beauty and her own art—is on-page and clearly tied to prior beats. The three-night wait and the moon’s arrival give a gentle but legible tightening of the narrative arc. Stakes are quiet but coherent, with no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: letters → dirigible mission → descent to lagoon → failed normal communication → debris glyph parley → trade → release and extraction. The story lands clear closure with a decisive change (the Scribe is freed, the lagoon turns to rock) and a reconfigured situation (Elara now holds the cipher and its burden). Structure is tight and single-scene coherent under a Causal lens, with no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the resolution unfolds very smoothly once the parley begins, with minimal complication or structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: abandoned town → possession of the bottle → decision to repopulate → mental genesis → bottling → approach to shatter, all under one continuous scene. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative texture of mounting detail, and the closure moment (raised bottle, charged with “a thousand imagined heartbeats”) functions as a convincing Charged Poise. Stakes and cost are legible, but we stop one beat before the decisive change—no actual release—so the story closes on anticipation rather than transformation. That keeps the structure effective but just shy of fully satisfying resolution for a top-tier literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: foghorn stops → memory resurfaces → immersion experiment → playback → prophecy realization → final record, giving a strong sense of before/after in his knowledge and the tower’s status. The piece lands a clear Conceptual Repricing closure: the tower’s time has “officially run out,” reweighting all prior calm routine. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and backstory is brief and functional. The only slight limitation is that external consequences remain offstage, keeping the climax mostly intellectual/emotional rather than dramatized in events.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: egg hatches → world flash-frozen → vortex inheritance blocks access → Elian uses entropy-decrease via acorn cap → vault reopens → he descends and apprehends “borrowed time.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing where the premise of entropy control is reweighted by his awareness of stolen time. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric deepening), and that lens holds consistently. The main structural limitation is that the central challenge (taming the vortex) resolves without much resistance, which softens the sense of earned cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene with a clear ticking clock from “less than two minutes away” to zero hour. Causality is tight—his prior microclimate tracking leads to the recognition of anomaly, which makes the choice at zero hour necessary and legible. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he foregoes the blast, powers down, and the season turns in silence with explicit future consequence (explaining to superiors). There are no orientation or lens issues, and the quiet ending lands with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene driven by the meteor’s approach and Elara’s response to it, with a clear before/after in how she sees her work and the “dust.” Causality is straightforward—warning chime → observation → emotional/interpretive shift—and the accumulative lyric mode is held consistently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she returns to cleaning but with a reweighted understanding (“tending to the altar where the universe sacrificed itself to become beautiful”), and the cost is her acceptance of obscurity in exchange for private meaning. The stakes are modest and internal, but fully coherent for this length and design.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation: ghosts press in, one specific spirit escalates that pressure, and Elias’s ritual act restores the prior order with a reweighted final image. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens—his deliberate non-engagement and use of the box directly affect the ghost’s state and the oasis’s “noise level.” Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: he reaffirms his role as guardian of silence, and the world is subtly reconfigured (the woman becomes “landscape”). The stakes are conceptual rather than physical but legible and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: covert message → summons to sub-basement → discovery of capsule → contact with urn → conceptual shift and charged final image. Orientation is solid from the opening and the accumulative/textural lens holds, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing around death as the surviving “equation.” The closure has cost: she stabilizes her timeline by embracing a grim, abrasive conception of time and mortality. Some steps (security bypass, the responder’s motives) are sketched rather than pressured, but they don’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: storm → tending → ritual preparation → kite incident → resolved stance. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the first paragraph, and causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as Elian chooses to weave loss into the dawn rather than erase it, with a clear before/after in the state of the world’s “harmony.” The cost is subtle but present in allowing the flaw to stand and accepting an imperfect tapestry.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: prognosis → return to island → discovery/use of the pillars’ nervous system → copper-bridge experiment → gradual success → death with the system transformed. The structure is essentially a single throughline with a large time-compression summary (“Weeks bled into months”), which keeps orientation but flattens intermediate turning points. Closure is strong: the temple reconfigured from prison to battery and the heart-matching pulse deliver a legible before/after with cost. The main structural limitation is that most of the struggle and potential for failure are narrated rather than dramatized in discrete, escalating beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: forbidden ascent → discovery of purposeful footprints → recognition of Aris → confirmation of her theory → decision to refuse the pilgrimage. The story maintains a single, continuous scene with clear spatial progression and no orientation issues. Closure lands on Elara’s decision to “stop returning,” embodied in the act of throwing the amber, with a legible conceptual and emotional cost. The Skinner-box/nostalgia exposition leans explanatory but still follows logically from earlier setup.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: coachman arrives, reads the birds, speaks the dead language, casts seeds, receives concord, and departs, all in a single, coherent scene. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph and the drive lens (largely causal with lyric accumulation) stays stable. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield-ocean is literally and symbolically reweighted as the garden takes hold. The main structural weakness is the absence of any complication or setback, which flattens the arc into a graceful curve rather than a true tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: cylinder → visual decoding method → riddle → leaf as key → hidden coordinates → radio frequency and the implied reunion. The piece functions under a mostly causal lens with a lyric overlay, and the closure (from hopeless stasis to charged possibility) is legible. Cost is softer and mostly implied—he chooses hope and future risk over numb endurance—but the before/after line is still distinct. Structurally it’s one coherent scene with a clean escalation in knowledge rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single continuous scene with interleaved reflection; orientation (who/where/when) is very clear early on. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: her decision to keep the ritual leads to sketching, which creates the opportunity for the glimpse and the reconfiguration of her stance. Closure lands as a decisive change of intent with conceptual cost—she’s no longer just surviving but committing to a daunting, likely fatal project inside a hostile physics. Stakes are modestly scaled (internal and existential rather than plot-driven), but they’re coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: reach the spire → verify cosmic alignment → swap pieces → break stalemate → world reconfigures, with a clear before/after and an on-page decisive change. Orientation is solid early (who, where, when, what he wants), and the single-scene structure suits the scale. Closure is strong conceptually and narratively—the mechanism clicks, wards dissolve, sky and clouds merge—though the cost is mostly implied for the world rather than felt by Elian himself. Still, the drive lens (largely causal with a conceptual overlay) holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one primary scene with backstory woven in, organized around the rise of sonic chaos and its release. Causality is clear—escalating whispers → risk of losing clarity → intervention with the chess kings → silence → revelation of the dust text. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s grief is fixed in dust and absence, and Elias’s role in that is crystallized. Nothing crucial feels missing, though the “unbind” step is more mythic than mechanistic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric surface: life in the book-mountain → discovery of the stone → need for a key → phoenix quill decoding → decision to “seed” the mountain → stabilization and redefinition of home. Orientation (who/where/what she wants) is anchored quickly despite the surreal premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she trades perpetual avoidance for rootedness, with the cost of re-engaging dangerous powers and, implicitly, the grief they guard. The only limitation is that the emotional price of this pivot is implied more than directly dramatized in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: wish-born magic freezes the village, barrier weakens, Silas must decode the tapestry and pull the anchor thread, which restarts time. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the story holds a single coherent drive through to a decisive on-page change with visible consequences. The main structural limitation is the relative ease of success; the tapestry yields after one focused attempt, with little sense of possible failure or alternate tactics. Closure lands clearly but without a major structural surprise or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene from ritual setup through Kaelen’s disruption to the canyon’s transformation and his acceptance of consequences. Causality is tight—his deliberate choice of poetry, the canyon’s known echo behavior, and the spire’s unexpected refraction all link clearly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ritual’s purpose is conceptually overturned, and Kaelen’s future cost (punishment) is made explicit. The only constraint at this tier is that the ending resolves conceptually more than dramatically; we exit just before consequences land in action, which slightly softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: mechanical failure → plunge into acid → improvised ritual → death and reconfigured meaning, all in one continuous window. Causal links are firm (the sea forces the ritual now; the fit of charm and statue triggers the magic; her refusal to breathe buys time to complete it). Closure is strong: she pays with her life, but the before/after in meaning is legible through the transformed statue and workshop-as-amber image. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, and the ending’s conceptual repricing of “gold” and “resilience” lands on the page with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story’s causal chain is clean: death/mirror → pilgrimage into caves → wrong turn → discovery of pool → painting and release, with each step motivated by grief and the “hidden promise.” Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure in the cave holds together without temporal confusion. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he enacts the ritual, relinquishes the shell, and the line “the path home felt clearer now” marks a legible before/after with emotional cost. The only limitation is that the treacherousness of the caves and tide is more gestured at than structurally used to tighten options or complicate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: storm → foghorn failure → ship in danger → Elias chooses the vial → ship corrects course. Closure is concrete and earned, with the ship’s silhouette turning and Elias’s exhaustion marking a clear before/after. The world rules of intent-vibration and the vial are introduced before they are needed, so there’s no late-breaking convenience. Cost is present but mostly emotional/physical; a sharper sense of what he risks long-term could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: lunar peak → intensified spectral pressure → midnight call with coordinates → improvised conduction via the censer → manual alignment → corridor success and aftermath. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never slips, and the drive lens (accumulative pressure leading to an earned stasis) holds consistently. Closure is present and legible: tonight’s corridor holds at real cost, and we exit on a quiet but charged new equilibrium. The stakes and rules remain consistent, though a brief on-page hint of what failure would concretely look/feel like could sharpen the sense of cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: empathy virus + involuntary truth → isolation in ravine → failed rational cures → turn to discredited textbooks and glass eye → successful occlusion and new capacity to lie. Structure is tight single-POV, single-arc, with a clear before/after at the moment the ambient noise vanishes. Closure qualifies as a decisive change with conceptual cost (reliance on a fragile, quasi-magical workaround), though the story leans more on conceptual framing than dramatized consequence at the end. There are no major orientation or lens issues; the drive reads primarily causal with situational pressure from the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece is cleanly structured: object arrival → investigation → vision → interpretation → reconfiguration of Silas’s role, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure and meaning build coherently toward a conceptual repricing at the end—his lighthouse as beacon for the voluntarily forgotten, not just the lost. Causality is intact and legible (the boutonniere initiates the vision; his interpretive choice produces the insight), and closure is satisfying and on-page. The main limitation is that the path from discovery to realization feels smooth and unsurprising rather than genuinely precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece maintains a tight single-scene causal chain: flood pressure → ant trail → fissure → matrix → glimmer/doorway → choice. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the backstory is efficiently interleaved to tilt the present, not stall it. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (stepping through) with an Earned Stasis element (choosing to face the moment rather than alter it), and the cost is felt. No major set-ups are dropped or resolved by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene arc: climb → discovery of the bleeding sky → perilous crossing → refuge and reframed purpose, with clear because/therefore links. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Isolde’s role shifts from bureaucratic queen to guardian of the ember grotto, and the cost (abandonment of her old life, enduring the storm) is legible. The emergence of the fireflies as salvation feels slightly convenient, though the ember grotto itself is prefigured by the dreams. Overall structure is cohesive and the drive lens (Hybrid with situational pressure and causal beats) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear causal chain—preparation, arrival, confession, reaction, and the gifting of the pocket sun. The closure is strong (a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing): a new object exists, the friendship is reweighted by impending loss, and a cost is implicit in the “way back” line. Stakes remain intimate and never seriously jeopardize the experiment’s success, which keeps escalation modest rather than gripping. Still, the global drive reads cohesive and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: cabin frame → induced trance → dream flight → return to writing, all causally linked through the envy method. The throughline of “distill chaos into narrative” provides a coherent drive, and the final act of writing functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure with real cost. Time confusion is thematically central yet never breaks orientation, which remains clear. Escalation is more emotional/textural than event-heavy, but it deepens meaningfully to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal line is clean and proportional to the length: broken clock → Kael’s frustration/obsolescence fear → Elias reframes the problem and offers the screw → the fix works → relational/emotional reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shop’s emotional weather and the men’s status subtly shift with the clock’s restored heartbeat, and Elias’s constraint (no smell) still stands as a visible ongoing cost. The single-scene structure is tight; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues. The only limit is the modesty of the external stakes, but within that scope the structure is fully functional.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story is tightly structured as a single escalating scene: calm-before-storm → mounting symptoms → held-breath ritual → shedding → storm impact. Causality is clean: external storm + internal crystallization force her toward an unorthodox solution, and the ritual’s constraints (held breath, time dilation) are honored through to closure. The decisive change—she survives, mobile and reconfigured in relation to her affliction—is on-page and costs her pain and risk. There are no dropped setups or soft resets; everything introduced (storms, ink, superstition) pays off by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: Elena’s long-festering guilt → hiring Silas → electromagnetic ritual → corrupted manifestation → partial reconciliation → abrupt return to ordinary destruction. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology is delivered and accepted, yet grief and atmospheric sorrow remain. The orchard’s chainsaws at the end provide a strong external cadence that reweights the prior hush. Structure stays tight in a single continuous scene with no orientation or motivation gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the cosmic glitch, Elara’s non-linear path, confrontation with the Spiral Arbitration, and the choice of “unify” to resolve the crisis all link coherently. Closure is decisive and legible: the universe stabilizes, and her role resets for another cycle, satisfying a Causal lens with a clear before/after. The main weakness is that the actual selection and deployment of “unify” feel slightly too frictionless, with no real false attempt or near-failure to test the premise. Still, the structure holds together tightly, and the ending image returns us convincingly to a charged stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and tight: whistle → quiet window → trance → locating seams → engaging the key → catastrophic revelation → desperate severing of the connection. The structure is essentially one escalating scene with a clear before/after conceptual repricing of time (from curiosity to understanding containment as mercy) that lands as closure. The backward counting spine provides strong structural scaffolding for escalation and anchors the more abstract metaphysics. A small limitation is that the external stakes remain mostly experiential and conceptual rather than concretely situational, so the cost feels slightly more cerebral than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a causal throughline from watching Mera → reflection on permeable boundaries → deliberate override of the system → shared, altered space. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing—he literally opens the barrier and redefines “security” as something that breathes. The cost (biosecurity risk, professional betrayal) is present but not concretely tested or escalated on the page, so the stakes skew conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation and lens (largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine) are clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: subway → impossible station → library → confrontation with mortality, all under a single POV. The causal leap into the fantastical (graffiti → hidden equations → off-map station) is clear enough for magic realism, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration as she accepts being both broken and whole. Stakes remain mostly internal and philosophical, so progression feels more like a guided tour than mounting jeopardy. Still, the global drive (accumulative/textural) holds and the closure is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure: an intercepted call escalates into an emotional loop, which Silas then breaks, returning to poised readiness. Causality is sound—haunted board → need for glass harmonica → tuned connection → loop → dissonant disruption—and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in Silas’s ongoing, costly vocation. The main limitation is that the global drive feels more vignette-like than arc-driven for Silas himself; his stance doesn’t shift, even as he engineers change in others. Still, for this length, the tightening around the “critical emotional loop” and its shattering provides adequate structural satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: preparation → ritual → emotional reconfiguration. Causality is solid—her careful physical manipulations enable the magic, which then alters the emotional landscape of the jetty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the ritual, discards the now-empty locket, and her role and relationship to the memory change. Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: belief in cosmic reciprocity → theft and hoarding of the moon rock → rumor scheme → arrival of the woman → renunciation of the object in favor of risked intimacy. Closure lands solidly when he throws the rock onto the tracks and asks her to play, a decisive change that forecloses his prior strategy with clear emotional cost. The piece holds a mostly causal lens with a light accumulative texture, and the before/after is legible and satisfying. Structure is simple but tight, with no orientation issues or major dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: constellations pause → she enters → escalating traversal via trees → stillpoint → reconfiguration at the end. Causality is straightforward under an accumulative/textural lens; each touch and sensation advances her progress and knowledge toward the hidden message. Closure is solidly on-page: reaching the stillpoint reconfigures her internal state with a clear before/after in relation to grief and fear. The limitation is that the path feels a touch schematic, with no serious surprise or complication beyond “time is closing,” which keeps it below truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal frame is clean: he must repair the pen to rewrite history, then performs specific edits, ending with a reconfigured world (“history books…rewritten”). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the universe has been altered and his stance shifts from guilt-ridden uncertainty to a measured, provisional satisfaction. However, there is little sense of resistance or risk in the process—no beat where the attempt might fail or backfire—so the throughline feels more like an elegant demonstration of a power than a pressured arc. The cost of this reconfiguration remains mostly conceptual and under-dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: a single continuous ritual builds from stillness through intensifying gesture to a shutter-click closure. Causality is coherent (his camera work responds to her signing; the disruption of quiet leads to the “music”), and the speculative “hour when no one remembers you” grounds the frame without confusion. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: being forgotten is revalued as the necessary blank for creation, with the final orchestral swell functioning as cost and reward. The main limitation is that options are never meaningfully narrowed—success feels foreordained rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—rebar statue → ventilation shaft → tapestry fragment → Rotunda → reinterpretation of the self-portrait—is clean and legible under a predominantly causal lens with accumulative texture. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she reinterprets Kael’s act and their shared fire, completing the promised “circuit” with cost in memory and identity. Structure is tight and single-POV, with no orientation confusion and a clear before/after in how she understands Kael and her own arson. The main limitation is that the decoding feels almost too smooth, with no real risk of failure or misstep to complicate the causal path.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: Kael’s drumming alters the Sound Wave Garden, destabilizes the procedure, and enables his escape into the entangled memory-space. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what the experiment is) and the story maintains a single continuous scene, with one clear transition into the dream. Closure is strong: the decisive change is his irreversible crossing over, with the cost (sanity and the waking world) clearly implied and stated. The scientists’ counter-pressure is a bit generic and offstage, making the opposition feel more atmospheric than structurally active, which slightly softens the climax’s tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: Elias detects Kael, lures him with the key, uses the folded route to arrive first, and springs a conceptual trap that culminates in Kael’s capture and Elias’s escape. The closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: the port’s logic literally folds and unfolds, foreclosing Kael’s options while confirming Elias’s thesis at real cost to Kael. Every beat follows as a clear “because/therefore,” with no major plausibility gaps within the story’s slightly heightened logic. A minor limitation is that the security/siren response feels a bit convenient and underdeveloped as a system, softening the sense of a robust external world.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single-scene accumulative/textural design: storm → tense dock → Elias’s choice to work the lantern → light tapestry → her internal reconfiguration. Causality is modest but coherent (she comes to confess; he chooses action over listening; the light pattern precipitates her reframing), and the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. The before/after—oppressive guilt versus quiet acceptance—is legible with a conceptual cost (living with secret rather than purging it). Structural risk is low but well-managed; nothing essential teleports or drops.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: clandestine teaching → descent to the grotto (to evade surveillance) → synchronized signal → city-wide puzzle disruption → mental hesitation as closure. The story maintains orientation from the Cobalt Library to the grotto to the city above without confusion, and the lodestones are integrated as a necessary enabler rather than a late convenience. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, the city moves in unquestioning efficiency; after, it is forced into active puzzling and doubt, with Elias explicitly perceiving the shift. The main limitation is that danger from the Authority stays mostly implied, so the external cost of his choice is conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: rising water and a vanishing island force a choice; Vane’s refusal escalates pressure; the whale’s call and scrimshaw catalyze his internal turn; the decisive act is detaching from the bollard. Closure is strong: Vane lets go, transforms, and they actively leave the vanished island behind, making the before/after legible with the loss of land and identity. The dominant drive lens reads as causal with a thematic overlay, and that lens holds consistently. The only limit is that the transformation mechanism arrives somewhat late and feels slightly like a graceful solution to a pre-existing problem rather than a fully pre-primed turn.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a tight single-scene arc: set-up of the turbines and Mandate, introduction of the bouquet, then the whittling ritual that culminates in the destruction of the flowers and attained emptiness. Causality is clean under an accumulative/situational lens—each step in his performance logically leads to a deeper severing from grief. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he succeeds in becoming “safe, alone, and completely empty,” with the cost legible in the ruined wedding bouquet. There are no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from entry into the atrium to immersion in the colonnade to a clear closure realization. Causality in an accumulative/lyric mode holds—each environmental shift (cloud, shade, deepening hum) leads to a deeper merging experience, culminating in the “tremor of certainty.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of earth/sky/self separation, with a legible before/after. Stakes and cost, however, remain primarily conceptual; the danger and former heresy never crystallize into a more concrete consequence, which limits structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s need → journey to the courtyard → symbolic negotiation → deployment of the reed → shattering and awakening. Orientation (who/where/what’s at stake) is established very early, and the rules of this odd economy—bartered awakenings through objects of utility—are learned through action, not exposition. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Silas is awake (if damaged), Elara’s “composition” is complete, and the price (loss of the reed, messy partial life) is paid on the page. The only limitation is that the larger implications of awakening Somnambulists and the social cost of this trade remain offstage, keeping the structural ambition modest.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single causal sequence: failed ritual → realization → experiment → transformed result. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, with stakes and goal (can she make Kael feel his grandfather) tightly focused. Closure lands via a decisive change in what is possible—frequency turned into touch—with a clear emotional consequence for Kael and a conceptual one for Elara. The only limitation is that the cost is mostly conceptual and emotional; there’s little sense of risk or consequence beyond success.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and causal: Elias summons, the woman arrives, the process unfolds, and the projected lilies reconfigure her stance toward grief. Orientation is strong from the opening—who, where, and what he does are legible early—and the “time is fluid here” line fits the semi-mythic frame. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the woman’s posture and breath change as her intention is finally externalized at her heart. The main limitation is that the piece reads as singularly procedural/emotional without any real risk that the process might fail, so tension in the middle stay modest.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece tracks cleanly as a single, causal scene: client’s question → card spread and measurements → recognition of anomaly → decision to confide about the engineered crash. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Silas shifts from detached cartomancer to witness of a global crime, with the measuring tape and ink reweighted in the final image. Causality is coherent and options narrow, though the investigative leap from geometric anomaly to vast conspiracy leans on exposition rather than dramatized inference. Still, the before/after is legible and thematically costly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: descent into the archive → chaotic navigation → encounter with the pagoda → revelation → return with altered stance. Drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture; each step follows logically from the last, and the stakes narrow toward the central rotunda. Closure is solid: the revelation and her decision to carry the truth alone constitute a decisive change with cost. A minor limitation is that some pressures (the archive trying to ensnare her) are summarized rather than played in distinct beats, which slightly flattens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: theory → verification via footage → search in the library → capture and metamorphosis → reflective aftermath. The closure is strong: the shadow is irrevocably bound into the stone, preserving hope at the woman’s and humanity’s cost, a clear before/after. The drive lens is mostly accumulative/textural, but causality remains legible and unbroken, with no orientation issues. The only limit is that external opposition is minimal, so the structural tension leans heavily on concept and mood rather than on hard tactical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Julian’s con causes the injury, which necessitates the surgery, which in turn catalyzes Elara’s internal shift. The story maintains a single, continuous scene with no orientation issues and a clear drive lens. Closure lands solidly as both a decisive change (removal of the tail tip) and a resonant reconfiguration of Elara’s worldview. Cost—lost innocence and permanently shortened tail—is on the page and conceptually integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain from waking post-surgery through divination via coffee rings to tunneling and exposing the glowing root. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the single-scene structure holds without confusion. Closure lands with a concrete before/after: screaming plants and hidden wound versus exposed root and lullaby, with physical cost on the page. The fractured timeline motif (the frozen hourglass) is suggestive rather than fully exploited structurally, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: set-up of space and motive, acquisition and reading of the strip, incubation, transfer, and a reweighted final image. Causality is intact at each step (can’t project → must touch → vision → warming → transfer into lens). Closure is a conceptual repricing: the discovery that unused love persists as stored light, with the strip’s spent state as cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently through to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: climb and set-up, attempt with the Star-Loom, escalation into overload, collapse, then the decisive shift to rest and receptivity. Causality is tight under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: because he forces the connection, the torrent becomes unbearable, compelling the change in tactic. Closure is on the page as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—he forecloses the path of active control at real cost (exhaustion, surrendering will) and redefines how creativity flows. Stakes of “freeing trapped creativity” stay a bit abstract, but the personal cost grounds them.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene that escalates from preparation to dangerous dispersion to restored stasis, with clear causal steps. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and concept rather than reversals, and closure comes via a charged poise: the archive is safe for now, at the cost of Kaelen’s ongoing sacrifice. Causality is internally consistent: the clock anchors, the song manipulates wave functions, the dispersion marks the peak risk. The cost is legible in the final image (“no dreams of his own…only the heavy, rhythmic responsibility”), though the possibility of true failure feels slightly abstract rather than keenly immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: wake in strange place → navigate via wind → discover turbine/gear → intervention → turbine reawakens and reconfigures his stance. Causality is tight and legible under a largely causal lens; each step “because/therefore” links to the next without teleports or retroactive patching. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his relationship to involuntary translocation and to his own mind is clearly different by the end, with felt cost (exhaustion, prior anxiety) acknowledged. The main cap is that stakes remain modestly scaled and the outcome relatively safe, so the decisive change, while coherent, doesn’t bite as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a situational/accumulative frame: leash breaks → ferry arrival → indirect traversal → vigil at the station → claiming unused courage. Orientation (who/where/what is happening) is clear very early, and the world’s rules are learned through concrete action (ticket, star, skiff) rather than exposition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from being held up by an external leash to standing via internalized courage, with a clear before/after. The only limit is that escalation is primarily internal and could carry slightly more palpable risk of failure or refusal at the vigil itself.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a single ascent framed by punishment leads causally to the discovery of the bolt, the conceptual revelation about the Keep, and the closing choice to stay. The drive lens reads as primarily Situational with causal links (task → staircase → scar in stone → bolt → realization → decision). Closure functions as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses fleeing and accepts a costly role as internal dissident, and that cost is explicit (likely death outside vs living-captivity inside). No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the only ceiling is that the external plot is quite minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Orel prepares the ink and rune, waits for the cosmological pause, then the Pretender’s reading triggers the spell and reconfigures reality. The single continuous scene is easy to follow, with clear spatial and temporal orientation in the Silent Atrium and during the zodiac pause. Closure lands decisively as a DC: the Pretender is literally unmoored and removed from the setting while Orel remains anchored, resolving the central power dispute in concrete terms. The cost is more conceptual than emotionally dramatized, but the before/after is unequivocal and earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: weeks of tapping and data collection → deliberate attempt to assemble a composite → unexpected topography → conceptual revaluation of what “disappearance” means. Orientation is strong early on (buoy station, drowned world, atlas, mission), and the piece maintains a coherent causal lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the road has not been erased but consumed by a super-reef, which reframes both the mystery and the human/ocean relationship. The cost is largely conceptual and ecological rather than immediate or personal, keeping the structure strong but not fully electrifying.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara enters with a clear goal, uses the stone circle and glasses in a specific way, and the frigate reignites, ending the rebellion’s lull—solid Decisive Change. Orientation is excellent early on (who/where/when and stakes are clear), and the single-scene structure is well-contained. The main limitation is that the outcome feels somewhat inevitable once the ritual begins; there’s little sense of real jeopardy or possible failure during the build, which mutes the perceived cost of success. Still, the before/after (dead frigate vs. white-light resonance) reads strongly and coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: moss warnings → decoding kite script → transmitting code → geothermal unsealing → the child’s emergence as patrols arrive. Closure is a decisive change: the embryo becomes an active savior, the Council’s Reconstruction project is essentially outflanked. Cost is implied (she’s breaking a sacred law and facing armed guards) but only lightly dramatized; we don’t see a specific sacrifice or irrecoverable loss in the final beat. Still, the arc reads as a coherent, single-scene causal build with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense work → sensory trigger → PTSD spiral → somatic navigation → return to task, all causally linked and legible under a situational/accumulative lens. The drone-strike memory enters through a concrete sound cue and is kept tightly tethered to on-page choices, so reflection never blurs the timeline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he has weathered one full cycle of trigger and response and recommits to his role, with cost still humming in the background. There are no causality breaks or soft resets, and the stakes implied at the start (can he function under this pressure?) are answered by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene escalating from observation of fragmentation to physical collapse, redesign, and descent. Causality is intact under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: glitching reality → recognition of knotted space → redesign via untangling → chute → fall. Closure lands as a decisive change (choosing the void) with conceptual repricing (darkness as true canvas), and the price—abandoning light, self, and world—is legible. The piece maintains coherence despite its lyric density, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: eclipse ends → Silas advances with drone → corners Kaelen → ink ritual → disappearance → Silas’s revised goal, all within a single continuous scene. The drive lens is primarily Causal with a conceptual tilt: each beat logically narrows options and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing of what “the crisis” means. Closure is solid—a visible before/after in Silas’s pursuit focus, with the cost of the failed capture clearly on the page. The only limitation is that the confrontation itself resolves quickly once the ink is deployed, with little tactical back-and-forth, so escalation feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: discovery of the letter → recognition of digital censorship → decision to use dormant networks → Kael’s intrusion sharpening the choice → the irrevocable switch and broadcast. Orientation is excellent from the opening; we always know where we are, who’s present, and what the immediate options are. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost, reconfiguring the entire society’s mythos and foreclosing Elara’s chance to quietly remain loyal. The only minor limitation is that consequences are mostly implied off-page rather than tasted in even a brief immediate repercussion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean single scene with one main tightening: the perimeter alarm/intruder that tests Elara’s stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she renounces the violent option and the peace she cultivates visibly begins to affect the stranger. Causality is straightforward and coherent under a situational/accumulative lens, though the cost remains more conceptual than concretely perilous. Nothing crucial is left unresolved, and the before/after in her stance relative to her father’s creed is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: hostile environment → descent of constellations disrupting patterns → tactical approach → timed strike → capture. The structure is a single, continuous hunt sequence that escalates toward the fracture moment when “patterns break themselves,” giving a clear before/after in the world and in Elara’s options. Closure is solidly on the page as a Decisive Change (she captures the echo) with a faint Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image of divinity wrapped for sale. The main limitation is that the cost of success—beyond mild mental strain—is conceptually implied rather than concretely dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: phone call → threat to legacy → analytical investigation → logical rebuttal → threat dissipated, all within a single coherent scene. Closure lands as a decisive change: the story will not run, and Eleanor conceptually “alters the orbit.” However, the resolution feels somewhat too easy; Sterling offers minimal real resistance and the “by morning” deadline never bites hard. Structurally it’s solid and publishable, but the lack of on-page cost or complication keeps it out of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: letters → lab → machine activation → temporal distortion → narrow window to tether → successful capture and emotional reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/what) is very clear early, and the time-folding phenomenon is introduced before being used to create a live clock. Closure lands as both a decisive change (the ghostly burden offloaded) and a resonant reconfiguration (her guilt re-situated), with the cost of “not bringing the dead back” plainly felt. The scene stays in one contiguous window without extraneous detours, and no major set-ups are left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elian arrives to investigate the Unlearning, amplifies the ghosts with the tile, the sonic chaos escalates, he recognizes the need for a moderator, and his sand intervention produces the emergent hush. The single-scene structure is tight, with no orientation issues and a clear before/after in the grotto’s soundscape. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghosts find peace, the tile goes cold, and Elian accepts the loss of specific memories for the sake of that resolution. The main limitation is that the global stakes of the Unlearning remain more atmospheric than directly tested in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single causal sequence: patrol in ruined plaza → discovery of the child → protocol vs glitch conflict → tactical hack of the classification system → protective aftermath. Orientation is strong from the opening paragraph, and the global drive (save or sacrifice the human under machine oversight) remains coherent. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the world’s rules are not overturned, but 734’s defiant stance is crystallized with visible risk. The only limitation is that system opposition accepts the rename without resistance, softening the sense of structural danger at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Clara’s desperate coin flip, the Tower result and temporal fracture, Barnaby’s constrained options, and his deliberate manipulation of echoes leading to Clara’s decisive change of course. The piece sustains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues and lands clear closure in Clara’s choice not to sell. The cost is implied rather than dramatized—the financial peril and labor ahead are gestured at, not felt on the page. Still, under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, the progression and ending are structurally sound and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: global failure of the hive → Mara’s damage → Elias’s devised method → the painting session → the reveal of the image that reconfigures her stance. Causality holds at every step and the single-scene frame is efficient. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara is still haunted, but her relation to the “noise” has changed and the marriage’s coping strategy crystallizes. The cost—ongoing voices and fragility—is present but somewhat muted on the page, keeping the ending powerful but short of truly shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that accumulates from patrol → signal → descent/hover → revelation → return. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent—each technological and environmental element naturally leads to the next layer of perception. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “map” redefined as guidance for hearts, and Elara’s role reweighted as interpreter of waking. Cost is present but quiet, mostly in the implied ongoing psychic strain of this custodial task rather than a concrete sacrifice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and cumulative: retrieve jar → unleash chaos → methodical tuning via buttons → conceptual revelation → inversion of the master hourglass, with each step logically following the last. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: prophecy redefined from doom to chorus, history’s “fixed” future replaced by cyclical, chosen possibility. The cost is the loss of the valley’s old certainty and of Elias’s merely custodial role, though this price is more implied than pressed. Within an accumulative/lyric frame, the causal throughline and final reconfiguration are strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias returns → lays out snow codes under fog cover → is detected → confronts his handler via radio → offers the pillbox proof → is spared but not reclaimed. The structure is a single, continuous scene with one clear tightening when the helicopter appears and refuses to land, forcing a mediated, precarious contact. Closure is decisive and costly: the file is “closed” but Elias is left alone in limbo, alive without full absolution. There are no causality gaps or orientation issues; the drive lens (causal with internal stakes) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single, continuous ritual scene under a clear time constraint, culminating in the woman’s eligibility to cross. Causality holds—Silas’s intervention lightens the burden, the ticking stops, and only then can they move onto the bridge—so the closure (a resonant reconfiguration) lands. The cost and “what if” of missing the grace period are implied rather than dramatized, which softens the sense of jeopardy. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and is maintained consistently through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build from arrival/intent through discovery to quiet reconfiguration. Causality is coherent: working the clay and using the glass elicit the thrum, which reveals the oasis’s rule and leads to his thematic realization and renunciation of a larger “fixing” goal. Closure lands as an earned stasis/CR: he accepts the scarred oasis as an act of devotion and leaves the vessel, a new layer in the site’s timeline. Stakes are conceptually clear but relatively gentle, so the sense of cost at the end is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: petal falls → he can “allow” himself to act → specialized tool confronts corrosion → mechanism yields → light reaches its target. The piece maintains single-scene continuity and a coherent drive toward a modest but focused closure. Closure operates as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he has traded biological gardening for mechanical stewardship with visible cost (the rose) and a reconfigured role. Stakes remain small in scope, so while the arc is precise, the sense of structural risk and cost is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: awakening in distress → ascent to the mechanism → ritual → reconfigured stance as she descends. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each step logically follows from her need to stabilize her mind. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with a before/after in how she relates to her memories and solitude, and the cost is the painful, full confrontation with her present self. Stakes and trajectory remain legible throughout, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: storm ends → object and client framed → recognition of the installation’s lack → decision to insert the spiral → reconfiguration and insight. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure—a conceptual repricing around integration—lands clearly. The act of placing the spiral is the decisive change, but there’s little sense of alternatives or risk; the path from noticing the gap to filling it is almost too smooth. The story reads as a single coherent scene with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is solid: cosmic signal → polarized factions rioting → Elias discovers their perigee leverage → uses the station to broadcast a counter-signal → mobs disperse and entities retreat. The action confines itself to one clearly oriented scene with a tight external clock (screams and torches outside) and a decisive act at the climax (slamming the master fader). Closure is clean: the decisive change is the severing of the entities’ influence, with a conceptual cost in the knowledge this is only a temporary local victory. The one limitation is how smoothly the interference works on the first attempt, which slightly undercuts the sense of cost or risk in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: arrive → prepare the organ → trigger the spatial mutiny → play through mounting danger → sonic resolution and world “awakening.” Causality is tight and legible; every major beat flows from the previous one and from her stated plan, with no deus ex machina. Closure lands on-page with a clear before/after (dormant versus awakened world; threatened versus stabilized nexus) and a visible cost in exertion and fear. The “vital key” and global consequences remain slightly abstract, which softens the impact of otherwise solid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: arrival/setup in the quarry, the process of making the portrait, the mixed-media climax, and Miller’s emotional turn. Causality is sound—Silas’s specialized method is necessary because the case is old and evidence gone, and the portrait’s construction leads directly to Miller’s reconfigured stance on the case. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the cold case becomes a “ghost demanding to be heard,” and the town’s indifference is reframed as an infection lanced. There are no major structural slips, though the stakes remain primarily emotional rather than materially evolving.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: journals → station → nail → question → ship’s return, all in a single continuous scene. Orientation is swift and solid (who/where/when are clear almost immediately), and the drive lens stays causal with a touch of accumulative dread. Closure is decisive and on-page: the brigantine emerges and Silas’s exile reverses, reconfiguring both history and Elara’s legacy. The cost is largely conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized as a real risk of failure or punishment, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: hitchhiker’s disappearance → discovery of the shard → decoding the scaffold wrap → optical glitch → revaluation of guilt → decision to cross. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: he accepts a softened-resolution world and chooses to proceed, foreclosing self-torment as his default stance. Causality is coherent even within the surreal physics; each new layer (binary pulses, glass alignment, pixelation) escalates or clarifies the premise rather than feeling like a late rule change. The cost—letting go of the sharpness of his self-indictments—is legible, though the external stakes of crossing remain more metaphoric than materially tested.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: startup rise → acquisition threat → Silas’s counter-tactic → failed deal → slow collapse → Silas’s exit. The closure unit (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) lands: he walks away having proven his thesis about cyclical greed at the cost of the company’s life. However, both the pivotal confrontation with the acquisition firm and the subsequent implosion are summarized rather than dramatized, so key turns lack on-page friction. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative, reflective overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: observatory setup → star-guided descent → temple confrontation → verbal healing → waking reinterpretation. The closure lands solidly with a clear before/after: the burden dispersed, the telegram “just paper,” and the inscriptions now legible as human pain. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong thematic overlay, and the single scene transition (reality to dream and back) is smooth. The only limitation is that the journey feels almost too frictionless, with no serious doubt or failed attempt to complicate the line.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: failed trick → vortex → frozen confession → Kaelen’s intervention → release of the scream, with each step motivated and legible under a causal drive lens. The story offers solid closure via a Decisive Change—Kaelen breaks the shell and the truth is literally unleashed—and the before/after is clear. Stakes (the hidden betrayal and crown) remain mostly conceptual, with little on-page consequence for Kaelen beyond fulfillment of aim, which keeps the ending from feeling fully weighty. Structure is straightforward, single-scene and efficient, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Jaren arrives with the clipping, links with Elara through shared scars, enters the psychic labyrinth, finds the nexus, and emerges with new knowledge that changes his options going forward. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in knowledge and a Charged Poise: the path is now “burned into his mind,” the object spent, and the balance-restoration quest concretely enabled. Stakes remain somewhat abstracted at the world scale, and Jaren’s success in the maze feels a bit smooth—no real risk of failure materializes on the page. Still, the structure is coherent and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Elian descends with a clear goal, prepares the ritual, confronts the orchard’s resistance, pays a price, and achieves a reconfigured outcome. The rules of bartered destinies and the need for a substitute are legible and drive the decisive change at the end. Closure lands solidly with a felt cost—Leda’s joy restored at the expense of his certainty and perhaps his own exit path. The only minor limitation is how smoothly the ritual succeeds on the first attempt, with the guardians’ opposition more atmospheric than structurally complicating.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: public failure → low-status scavenging job → discovery of potentially valuable artifact → struggle to confirm → internal revaluation at the end. The drive lens is primarily causal with an internal-arc closure: each step plausibly narrows his options toward needing this scrap to be real. Closure lands as an on-page conceptual and emotional turn when he reframes his role from profiteer to steward, with the cost implied in his acceptance of a humbler, less glamorous purpose. Stakes are modest but coherent for the scope, and nothing vital is resolved by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: Aris’s death → arbor destabilizing → Elian deciding to use the seed → planting it to stabilize the system and recontextualize Aris. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when are quickly legible) and the single-scene structure supports the lyric mode without confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aris is no longer “gone” but diffused through the arbor, and Elian’s sense of separation is conceptually reweighted. The main limitation is that the solution arrives without significant complication or genuine risk of failure, so the structural arc feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: tide rises, soul appears, smelting attempt, successful fusion, tide recedes. Causality is coherent and accumulative; each step follows logically from the last, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elian has preserved a paradoxical soul without erasure, reaffirming his function and meaning against entropy. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: inspection → discovery of shells → realization of their function → extraction of pearl → disobedience of orders → crowning the stalagmite and transformation of the bunker. Closure lands as a decisive change with a resonant reconfiguration: the space shifts from tomb to beacon, and Elias’s role from warden to participant in connection, with an implied cost in abandoning his mandate and the old “safety” paradigm. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the story maintains a coherent through-line under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The only limitation is that external consequences of defying his orders remain conceptual rather than concretely tested, keeping the cost more thematic than dramatically enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: station → lavatory divination → river confrontation, with clear causal links under an accumulative, interior lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias’s stance toward the river and his guilt has palpably shifted, at real emotional cost. The graffiti phrase and mapped coordinates are paid off by the precise bend in the river and the accordion ritual. The main limitation is that the journey from oracle to catharsis unfolds very smoothly, with little on-page resistance or complication to amplify the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: arrival → deciphering attempt → rising risk (cycle inversion) → extraction with the prize. Causality is strong under a mostly causal lens: the world rules (unfolding cipher, reversed logic) shape her tactics and the risk of being trapped gives the scene direction. Closure functions as a decisive change—she exits with new knowledge that will enable the second letter—and the “price” is primarily conceptual and risk-based rather than an on-page loss. Stakes are contained and coherent but not pushed to their most harrowing edge.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: investigation → coffee divination → recognition of “perforated destiny” → seed-violin fusion → transformed artifact. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the global drive reads as causal with a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is strong: the decisive act (destroy/transform the violin) tangibly breaks the Empire’s plan and reconfigures the world’s trajectory, with the cost implied in the coming imperial backlash. The main limitation is that the risk and resistance to this act stay mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through obstacles or consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: setup of goal and threat, method established, search for the pattern, the zero-point threshold, and the transfer into the chip with a clear before/after. Closure lands solidly with a Decisive Change: Vane’s body becomes an empty shell while his theorem is preserved in the emerald. Structure is straightforward and linear, with no orientation issues and one escalating procedure leading to climax. The main limitation is that the path never truly complicates—once the method works, there is little sense that failure is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a well-anchored flashback, moving from problem (stubborn vine) to consideration (tree) to solution and conceptual shift at the end. Causality is intact—her reflection on her own past terror leads directly to her new tactic with the pod and the thematic reweighting about contentment. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward her work and her own wound shifts in a legible before/after way. The only drawback is that escalation is modest and the obstacle resolves smoothly, so the pattern feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single escalating scene from pre-dawn to sunrise with clear causal links—consultation request → wind-chime diagnosis → mirror shock → cloak-enabled doubt. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (embers, beach, lighthouse at dawn), and the drive lens reads as situational with tight causal underpinnings. Closure lands in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Vance, no longer certain, stands wrapped in doubt as the bombardment decision hangs with newly visible cost. The only constraint is that the psychological tools (cloak, mirror) feel slightly convenient, introduced as needed rather than as long-standing constraints in the world.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: lesson → induction of trance via grotto → altered perception of ripples → conceptual turn → reconfigured understanding at the end. Orientation is strong from the outset with clear where/who/what, and the single scene holds together without temporal confusion. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Kael realizes “It became the motion,” clearly marking a before/after in his relation to power and ego. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in future consequences, but it’s legible and coherent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: preparation (reading air), execution (throw), amplification (riding the sound and intersecting the old scream), and closure (mapped exit and first steps). Causality is strong and legible; each move grows out of the established rules of the canyon and Silas’s skill. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration—he goes from trapped and searching to knowing the route and acting on it. The cost (decades of entrapment, physical erosion into the dust) is clear and retroactively charges the “theoretically impossible” goal.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: exile from the Loom-driven city → ascent via mist walking → keystone retrieval/use → arch restoration → Loom disruption and personal reconfiguration of magic. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the story maintains a single continuous scene with mounting focus on the arch. Closure lands as a decisive act (replacing the stone) paired with a conceptual repricing of magic and creativity, with the cost of abandoning systemic protection and embracing vulnerability clearly implied in her unstrapping the pack and physical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: extinguishing lamps → diving to the wreck → navigation through the ship → accessing the library → opening jar 707 → emotional reconfiguration on ascent. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and the closure (him returning to his pier role with a transformed relationship to silence and dawn) lands as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration. Stakes and objective stay coherent around a single throughline—confirming her vow—without digressions or structural confusion. The only thing keeping this short of 9+ is that the pressure curve is smooth rather than sharply tightening; there is no single, distinctly escalating turn before he opens the jar.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear task (find and decode a signal), a central conceptual reveal (backwards prophecy), and a closing stance choice (he continues despite doubt). Under a situational/accumulative lens, pressure coheres around the universe’s collapse and the narrowing possibility of a rebound. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the final image of him gathering the coins again is a legible before/after in attitude, with the cost of continued effort under potential meaninglessness. The beat progression is somewhat static and inward; a slightly more concrete shift in his options or the environment would strengthen the sense of structural escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal chain—adjusting the observatory, focusing light, crystallizing fears, arriving at “Map complete.” Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: before, the fears and grief are nebulous; after, they’re contained objects and his loss has been reweighted. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural, and the pattern of repeated crystallizations builds toward the final blank map and ornaments. The main limitation is that no beat seriously threatens failure or reversal; the path from intention to completion is relatively unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: empty world → plan to fix imbalance via bell → meticulous repair → toll that begins the sea’s return. The single-scene structure is tight and oriented from the opening line; the rules of the magic and the stakes are internally consistent. Closure is a clear Decisive Change—the bell is restored, the geyser erupts—with a hint of future cost in the “heavy door” metaphor, though that cost doesn’t land fully on-page. The lack of a complicating turn or setback before success keeps this just short of elite-level structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: drought → ruins resurfacing → Elias’s cue from the wind chime → his night descent and curated intervention → anticipated morning discovery and reconfigured communal memory. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual repricing closure, and the final image (people “would follow the trail… and find peace instead of scandal”) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The stakes remain mostly abstract/emotional—no direct opposition or on-page threat—but they are legible and relevant to his goal. Structure is straightforward single-scene progression without gaps or confusing jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: looming celestial deadline → failed prior methods → turn to the starlings → summoning the silver flame → transformation of the crystal. Stakes (lose the magnum opus forever if she misses this window) are well embedded and the single-scene structure is clean and legible. Closure is solid—a decisive success that also reconfigures her worldview—but the cost of success feels largely abstract, with no hard trade-off beyond her internal reorientation. The drive reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: radio static clears → narrow launch window → discovery of the fracture → improvisation under time pressure → successful deployment → lingering emotional cost. Orientation is solid from the opening; we know who, where, and when, and the single scene unfolds without temporal confusion. Closure lands via a concrete outcome (the parachute holds) coupled with a resonant internal resolution (he returns to watching with a new weight). The drive lens is Causal with a strong textural overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the court ruling leads to the duel, which Kael wins by his method of opposites, allowing him to vivify the Duplicate and reclaim emotional life. The drive lens reads as Causal, and closure lands with a decisive change—Kael gains a new, embodied future as Vane and his claim are erased by the shifting timeline. Stakes and situation are oriented early, and the floating arena/time-spasm conceit remains coherent. The main limitation is that the “cost” of the transfer is more implied than dramatized; Kael’s battery drain or existential risk isn’t materially tested.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: unsolicited seed → decision to cultivate → construction of incubator → sprouting → identification as corpse flower → new escape room concept. The single-scene structure is compact and easy to follow, and closure lands with a clear before/after in his creative block. That said, the decisive change is modest—there’s no serious obstacle, reversal, or threatened failure beyond the initial block, so the climax feels more like a pleasant solution than a hard-won turn. Cost at the end is conceptual (turning a biological “time bomb” into entertainment) but underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulation: power up the machines, build the storm of sound, then breach the past with laughter. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: more noise, more pressure on the “calcified silence,” culminating in the auditory visitation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the world briefly becomes “a nursery filled with light,” with on-page emotional cost as the moment is explicitly bounded by the fuel. There are no wasted turns, though the path is fairly straight once the premise is understood.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: breach in the “veil of sleep” → defensive interiorizing of the landscape → confrontation with the pendant’s light → decision to wait and share silence. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but events still progress in a coherent because/therefore chain. Closure via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise lands: the scene ends on a reconfigured relationship to intruders and to solitude, with the library-garden’s status subtly altered. Stakes and plot are modest but fully appropriate to the lyric scale, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: attempts to vivify → failures and deepening cold → reframed understanding → altered method → success with cost. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-scene arc keeps pressure coherent. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual reweighting: the crozier is destroyed, a new independent heat-source exists, and the world’s options are reconfigured. The only ceiling is that the progression is relatively straightforward rather than structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single causal sequence: climb → set up relic → interference overwhelms signal → new tactic → successful capture → tidy exit. Closure is present in the successful recording recontextualized as a “recipe” rather than an obituary, but the cost of success is minimal and largely conceptual. The structural turn—shifting from listening for sound to listening for silence—is clear and well-motivated. Still, the danger from the towers and volatile magic never meaningfully bites into her options or imposes a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: vanished ferry in stasis → Elara identifies the hourglass/time problem → she uses the radio/ticking to generate sand → the ferry re-enters reality. Orientation is strong and the drive lens remains causal through closure, with a decisive change on the page. The main structural weakness is lack of real resistance or setback—the solution unfolds in a near-frictionless progression, and the mechanics of “audio frequency becomes sand” are accepted without any on-page test or complication. Closure still lands, but with less bite than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias enters with a goal, applies his rational enchantment, the tension in the illusions builds, and his over-binding precipitates the eruption and collapse. The story holds a single continuous scene with a clear before/after, and the closure—a violent spatial unfolding and the realization that the “texture of connection” is pain—lands with on-page cost. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a strong causal spine, and that pattern stays consistent. A slight limitation is that the global consequences of his failure are left abstract, keeping the structural stakes more conceptual than situationally concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term secret study → specific experiment with expanded sensors and edge geometry → revelation of the stars → emotionally costly realization and renunciation. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the piece fits a single continuous scene that escalates to a clear closure unit. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he attains his conceptual goal but accepts ongoing physical confinement, with the log entry and shutdown foreclosing further immediate transgression. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that external consequences or constraints to his act remain largely implied rather than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discarded box → photograph anomaly → hearing aid as conduit → discovery of the child → direct confrontation with the shadows → transformed photograph. Closure is strong, with a clear before/after (a lost spirit now anchored, Elara changed by the cost of intervening). The structure is a single, coherent scene with one tightening arc and no orientation issues. The only limitation is that the aftermath cost is mostly summarized in exhaustion rather than structurally complicating her world or future options.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → sensor confirmation → discovery of anchor → initiation of Return → successful retrieval → escape before the tide snaps the umbilical. The live clock and the umbilical’s fragility provide a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Closure is decisive and on-page: the trapped team is released and he escapes, with cost in risk and psychological strain. A slight feeling of procedural smoothness in the reconstitution sequence (no serious complication mid-process) keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: ghost-in-the-system access → ritual setup with shard and ink → digital summoning → revelation and repricing of the past. Closure is strong and legible: he gains the painful knowledge he sought, the connection severs, and he resumes his heartbeat counting with altered understanding. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal with accumulative textural weight from recurring images), and the lens holds through to the final image. Stakes are intimate but coherent, with no major causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: problem (death of language in hostile acoustics) → plan (use cursed flawed diamond + tunnel) → enabling event (arrival of birds) → execution → cost (voice taken) → reconfigured world (wind now “speaks” texture). Structure is a single, continuous scene with backstory folded in efficiently, and the closure is a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with strong textural accumulation, and the final image (“a world that would never again be truly silent”) lands with clear cost. The only limit is that very little goes wrong or complicates the plan on the way; escalation is mostly linear rather than pressured by reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the arrowhead → choice to retrieve the phone → ritual with resentments and blood → gravitational shift → metamorphosis of the brother, culminating in a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. Stakes and procedure are legible and the single-scene structure holds; “after the missing return changed” efficiently frames the anomaly without bogging the scene. The closure has on-page cost (self-injury, emotional exposure) and a strong payoff image, though the mechanics of why this particular combination works remain more mythic than logically grounded. Escalation is linear with no major gaps, but an additional complication or failed attempt could have deepened the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s decision to play → heart-synced resonance → disruption of the statues/orchard grid → violent uprising → transformed city. Orientation is solid from the opening paragraph, and the single continuous scene builds to a decisive, on-page change with visible cost (the city “broken, bleeding green and gold”). The drive lens reads as causal with a touch of accumulative lyricism, and closure is unambiguous. The only slight weakness is how swiftly and absolutely the uprising succeeds, softening a sense of tactical resistance or near-failure before victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a tight causal chain: DMZ entry → drone grid → threading absences → drop box → delivery, with each step constrained by prior setup. The drive lens is primarily causal with a lyric surface, and closure lands cleanly when he commits to the drop, creating a before/after defined by risk faced and mission completed. Cost—physical risk, meticulous timing, and psychic strain—registers on the page, and the final waiting for distant thunder provides a satisfying charged poise. Escalation is somewhat linear and lacks a strong reversal, but for this length the single tightening passes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: bell chime → time-bounded work → search for luminosity → wrong-turn oasis → halo fragment → need to match its vibration → singing → infusion into the horse. Structure is linear, single-POV, and the closure (horse animated, hush transformed into “eternal voice”) lands clearly as a decisive change. The portal-like wrong turn is slightly convenient, and the cost of the bell going silent is implied more than dramatized, but overall coherence and closure are strong. The piece reads as a tight causal lyric rather than pure mood.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: preparation → ritual → liminal breach → collapse, with clean orientation and no causality breaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she fails to enter, but the glimpse confirms the realm’s existence, altering the weight of her ongoing “ordinary” duties. Stakes are more conceptual than concrete, so the cost is implied rather than dramatized in practical consequences. Even so, the before/after (uncertain seeker → validated but still barred custodian) is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear before/after—she begins burdened by an unsolved ache and ends released from it. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens: sunrise enables capture, which enables constructing the city, which enables discharge of longing when the construct dissolves. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the dream-city’s brief embodiment and dispersal reweight her pain into beauty, with a legible emotional cost. The stakes remain modestly scaled and the turns are smooth rather than surprising, but nothing essential in the closure is undercut.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the woman brings the token, Silas consults the star, disorients her, and the resulting surrender releases the idea. This yields a clear before/after with on-page cost (her panic, the relinquishing of her old self-image, and the vanished token). Structure fits the length and holds a single scene without temporal confusion. The resolution comes a touch easily—no real sense of potential failure once the process starts—which keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: long study of the wreck “constellations” → rare reversal of currents → new gap of light → mushroom appears → physical contact restores the memory. Orientation is excellent from the opening, with who/where/what he wants anchored quickly and held steady. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change with legible cost (decades of isolation and risk finally paying off). The structure is somewhat linear and low-friction once the alignment arrives—there’s no serious on-page setback or uncertainty in the final movement—which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Lenore's agitation → Silas’s divination and decision → deceptive “reinforcement” that creates fracture points → Lenore exploiting them → shattering and emergence. The story maintains a single, continuous scene in a clear location, with no orientation or lens confusion. Closure is decisively on-page (shadow to embodied woman, captivity to freedom) and the cost of three years of exile and hard-fought return is implicit but legible. The only minor limitation is that the legalistic concept of “reversible exile” is delivered briskly via exposition rather than being more organically dramatized across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Elian’s aim to deliver wonder → salvaging the seed → cutting its shell → weaving its essence into the waterfall → release toward the iron city. The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed becomes dispersed dream and Elian’s guardianship is reaffirmed. However, the path is almost frictionless—no real complication, failure risk, or competing demand emerges to challenge the plan. The cost is mostly conceptual (ongoing burden, exhaustion) rather than a sharp, decisive change with clear before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: single scene, single POV, clear causal chain (net → exhumed silence → mask sealed). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the rules of the world (silence as weight, screaming masks) are internally consistent. Closure lands with cost: the mask is repaired, the spirit grounded, and Elian is left in a self-imposed prison of guilt and duty. The declared large-scale stakes (“ravage the waking world”) are mostly backgrounded in favor of the intimate cost, but that choice reads intentional rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara arrives with a goal, uses the archival footage to infer the mechanism, tests her hypothesis, and the chapel opens—an on-page Decisive Change with clear before/after. Orientation is excellent and the single-scene structure is well-contained with no causality slips. The main weakness is that stakes remain abstract (no articulated danger, moral risk, or practical obstacle), so while the plot is coherent, its structural tension is modest. Closure lands but feels more like a successful puzzle completion than a pressured, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, causal dive: enter wreck, locate anomaly, diagnose, intervene, and resolve, with clear spatial and situational orientation throughout. The closure—ending the scream-loop and lightening the library—functions as a solid decisive change with a legible before/after. However, Elias’s path is almost frictionless; no alternative outcome or real risk ever feels viable, which softens the sense of constraint at the climax. The conceptual cost is more for the captain than for Elias, which keeps the structure strong but not piercingly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Kaelen’s trapped state → Elian’s plan with graffiti and bolt plate → waiting for the storm → lightning strike enabling upload → lights smoothing as closure. The scene holds to one continuous window, and the “between lightning and thunder” beat provides a crisp temporal tightening that organizes the climax. Closure is decisive: the ghost’s noise calms, the mural goes inert, and Elian departs changed in situation and stance. There are no major orientation or logic slips; the hybrid of ritualistic and technological cause reads coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous elevator ascent, with a clear because/therefore chain from objects (goggles, diary) to discovery to recontextualized memory. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Halloway’s life is reweighted around joy rather than public grief, and Elian’s mission is fulfilled. The cost is subtle—Elian alone bears the intimate knowledge—but it is legible. Stakes remain modestly intellectual/emotional rather than sharply pressured, which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: observation → identification of emotional cloud → emergent anomaly → revelation of looped memory → conceptual revaluation of the sky, with no causality breaks. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: the sky shifts from chaotic graveyard to ordered “library,” and his role from stranded victim to “sole librarian,” with the cost of solitude intact. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds from start to finish, but agency is limited to attention and recording rather than active intervention, which keeps the climax somewhat contemplative. Still, the progression and payoff are very tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: failure with traditional drawing → discovery and decoding of the coin → execution of the sky → acceptance of imminent destruction. Causality is tight under a Situational/Accumulative lens, with the demolition clock and his artistic problem coherently intertwined. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when he sits to preserve the image in memory, with the cost (the work’s destruction and his acceptance of impermanence) made explicit on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: starling murmurations and ship rumors prompt investigation, which leads to the nursery, the phrasebook alignment, the hopscotch decoding, and finally the manifestation and dissolution of stranded luminance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has “charted the unchartable” but at the cost of the phenomenon itself, leaving only her record and altered understanding. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a light accumulative texture and remains stable. Stakes are somewhat low-intensity, but the structure itself is tight and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal drive is clean: prophecy → journey → architectural/psychic test → mechanical intervention → released moon. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the structure—door, hall of mirrors, Astrolabe, fix, veranda—tracks clearly as a single continuous scene. Closure is on-page and decisive: the gears turn, the moon moves, and the world’s paralysis ends with a new morning. The main limitation is that obstacles (mind architecture, seized gears, haunting light) yield fairly quickly once reached, so escalation feels slightly too smooth for the stakes claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong: environmental decay → ghostly messages → command to reexamine → discovery of resonance → engineering fix → nebula restored, with a clear before/after. Closure is decisive and legible: the radiation threat is materially changed and the family’s ongoing survival prospects reconfigured. The main soft spot is how neatly the watering bell’s pre-tuned frequency happens to match the required oscillation, which reads more as elegant fable than hard-earned problem-solving. Still, within a causal, slightly mythic SF mode, the structure is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Silas prepares the apparatus, aligns nested patterns using the puppet’s fracture, triggers the transmission, then reality and his body unspool as a result. The piece operates on an accumulative/lyric lens but still delivers closure: a conceptual repricing where annihilation is reweighted as a bridge carrying a “ghost of kindness” forward. Stakes and process are legible throughout; there are no orientation issues or broken rules in the worldbuilding. The main limitation is that the path from setup to success feels almost frictionless, with no meaningful threat of failure or alternative outcome dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: birds hunt → Silas spots travelers → retrieves nut → assembles override → birds fall, path opens, frost seals the maze. The drive lens is clearly causal, and the closure is a decisive change with visible cost and aftermath. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when and the rules of the world are legible early and hold. The only mild softness is how smoothly the “forgotten blueprint” solves the bird threat, which slightly reduces perceived difficulty of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: ravine observation → reflection on past plastics and wife → river-foam insight → decision to pursue a self-unraveling polymer. Causality holds under a causal/lyric lens, with each image or memory naturally feeding the next. Closure is on-page via a decisive reorientation of his legacy, symbolized by crushing and releasing the chrysalis dust. The cost and stakes (a lifetime of complicity and the enormity of his task) remain more conceptual than dramatized, which keeps the climax somewhat quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece is structurally coherent as a single-scene slice: orientation is immediate, the demonstration has a clear mini-arc, and the bell at the end provides a mild turn. Under an accumulative/textural lens, it builds method and motive toward the reveal of Elian’s true goal. However, closure is soft: the first customer’s arrival and Elian’s motive revelation reframe stakes but do not enact a decisive change or cost, so it reads more as a prologue than a self-contained story. Causality within the scene holds, but the global arc feels unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → tidal pools → detection of anomaly → excavation → contact with coral → ingestion → lifting of the fortress’s weight. The single-scene structure is tight and focused, and the closure is a clear decisive change with cost, as Elara internalizes the remorse to free the fortress. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early via the fortress-after-rain frame and maintained without confusion. The one limitation is that the legends’ confirmation and the "pantry of the past" explanation approach exposition rather than being fully dramatized, slightly softening the structural snap.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal line is clean: silos fracture → Elara alters the clock → sings through tubes → silos re-synchronize → she restores normal time. Structure is tight, a single scene with one escalation (adding the weight) followed by methodical application of her linguistic tactic and a clear before/after in the valley’s soundscape. Closure is satisfying but a bit frictionless: once she commits to her plan, no serious obstacle or unexpected complication arises beyond resistance from the mechanism. The cost (straining against the wheel, risking temporal disturbance) is present but could be sharpened to feel less foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from preparation to activation to a realized new state, with clear causal flow (modify device → neural coupling → entangled memory flood → new role understood). The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: pressure rises as sensory and conceptual density increase rather than via external reversals. Closure is a conceptual repricing—she understands “the weight of what humanity was leaving behind”—and that after/before line is clear. The only limit is that no concrete external consequence lands yet, so the cost remains largely internal and anticipatory.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: hour of inverted gravity → ascent into grotto → threshold traversal → spiral decoding → activation of Seeds → race back out before gravity reasserts. Closure is solidly on the page: the Seeds reignite, the ward is restored, and she escapes as the anomaly collapses, giving a clear before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with textural amplification, and the story sustains that through to the end. The main weakness is that all challenges resolve on the first try with no meaningful complication or near-failure to sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: reflection on a past failure leads to a revised method and the decisive experiment, culminating in the alder’s moan. Causality is solid—ash block → analysis of stress cracks → empathy in motion → new setup with porcelain and alder → strum and breakthrough. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in the world’s state (sound exists again for him) and a visible emotional cost (he collapses, weeping). Escalation is more meditative than plot-driven, but under an accumulative/textural lens it coheres well.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene, causally progressing from atmospheric build to analytical work to conceptual breakthrough and a final stance. The drive lens is primarily accumulative with a causal spine: because he correlates signals and listens to silence, he arrives at a reconfigured understanding of the Covenant and his exile. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—he forecloses returning to the city and reconceives his role—with a legible cost. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual, so the structural arc feels elegant but somewhat quiet rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear arc from challenge to attunement to opening, capped by the fireworks. Causality is coherent—each attempt with a new frequency leads to the realization about protection, then to success. Closure lands via a reconfiguration of the book’s silence (“The Exhale of Forgiven Regret”) and the gentle opening, but the outcome feels slightly foregone, with minimal sense that failure was a real option. The accumulative, ritualistic drive is well handled, if a bit low on palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored around the impending bloom, with backstory and custom (wrapping paper journaling) integrated smoothly via present cues. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: tending the flower → journaling practice → metaphysical timing → bloom → realization, culminating in an internal but legible shift. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: she redefines what “serenity” means in relation to motion and decay, and the final image of the drawing as an “anchor” makes the before/after clear. Stakes are internal and quiet, but the decisive change in understanding is on the page and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Flux window → instruments fail → water-flow navigation → discovery of the Gathering of Echoes → realization about sonic growth → reorientation of the arrow to save the orchards. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and maintained, and the single-scene structure is appropriate to the length. Closure lands as a decisive change: she activates the growth mechanism and departs carrying the solution. The main weakness is that the cost of this success (personal risk, possible failure) remains conceptually implied rather than dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal through-line—surveying, gathering data, discovering the patch, and realizing a “singular convergence” of failures—is clean and coherent in one continuous scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she moves from reconstructing a past tragedy to weaponizing that knowledge against future crashes. Stakes stay largely conceptual and technical rather than dramatized through an on-page near-miss or active danger, which slightly limits punch. Still, the structure is sound, with no orientation issues or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: establish cavern and role, intensify aurora, sync with the distant artist, execute the bell-ringing at the crucial instant, then land in a quiet reaffirmation. Causality is coherent under a mostly accumulative/textural lens: aurora → required ritual → timed ringing → transmitted inspiration → conceptual closing riff on wonder and utility. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration—Elian recommits to his strange, costly profession with the city and artist remaining offstage but legible as beneficiaries. The only limit is that the “risk” or possibility of failure is never meaningfully dramatized, so suspense stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is strong: pilgrimage → ritual preparation → playing the flute → vision → reframed understanding → departure, all cleanly linked. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he cannot repair the past but revalues the artifact’s function and his own failure, then chooses to leave with that cost. Stakes are scaled appropriately to the length—personal reckoning more than active world-saving—and there are no orientation or lens issues. A slightly sharper on-page sense of what concrete danger he courts by playing (beyond nausea and awe) could have heightened structural tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that progresses from setup to experiment to aftermath without causality breaks. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural—pressure builds as the machine activates and the sensations intensify, culminating in the universe’s further darkening and the Operator’s note that the equation remains unsolved. Closure is a conceptual repricing: we exit with a darker understanding of the Operator’s project and its cost to others, underlined by the extinguished star. Stakes and sequence are always legible, though the “experiment cycle” pattern is fairly straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: climb → aurora proximity → pendant activation → time dilation → atmospheric seeding → aftermath, with no orientation issues. The story delivers a clear decisive change (relic spent, task complete, world altered) and an earned stasis for Elara. However, the path from setup to success is relatively smooth, with little on-page jeopardy or complication testing her plan. The closure image of a changed sunrise for the villagers lands conceptually and structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: car brought to arbor → ritual initiated → environment shifts → vision appears → Mara’s belief reconfigures and the car is “just a car again.” Closure is a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s narrative of abandonment is replaced, and Elias’s theory is vindicated, both with emotional cost. The single-scene structure is coherent and needs no extra turns. The only ceiling here is that the outcome feels somewhat assured once the ritual begins, with little genuine doubt about success.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story tracks cleanly from premise (loom as message-sender) through rising pressure (the silence breaching the orchard) to a decisive, causal climax (her self-sacrifice powers the loom, sending the tapestry across the void). Orientation is strong early: we know who Elara is, where she is, and what the raveling silence does. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with cost and a reconfigured world (orchard erased, message in flight). The only limit keeping this below the very top is that the pattern of escalation is fairly straightforward, with no surprising structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: planet failing → Ewan rejects temples → descends via silk → offers barter → gravity restored. Closure lands firmly as a Decisive Change with a legible before/after and a conceptual price (sacrificing illusion for truth). However, the central problem resolves on the first attempt with no real setback, casting the “barter” as almost frictionless. Structurally it’s sound and readable, but for elite venues the ease of the success undercuts the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: relic → trance → multiverse search → redirection → revelation → emotional fallout, all in one coherent scene. The drive lens is clearly causal, and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing with a clear before/after in Elara’s understanding. The rift timing and mechanics are simple but legible, and the climax is dramatized rather than summarized. The only slight weakness is how quickly she locates the exact strand she needs, which trims some potential complexity from the search.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: lamp failure → ascent → confrontation with Thomas’s breakdown → symbolic repair via stones and sea glass → departure, with a clear before/after in Thomas’s state. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens—the psychic pressure of the dark and the haunted room steadily builds to the small, decisive ritual of protection. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the room’s meaning shifts from oppressive haunt to tenuously held sanctuary, with cost implied in the constant threat of relapse and the fragility of the “ember.” The only limitation is that the mechanical problem of the lamp recedes almost entirely, leaving the external stake a bit under-integrated at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene moving from storm onset → charging the wick → steering the beam → aftermath and charged final image. Causality is coherent (plummeting pressure → ritual setup → critical saturation → projection and city-ward storm), and the global drive reads Hybrid (causal spine with textural intensification). Closure is on-page: the storm has been steered, the networks washed away, and Silas rests in the new configuration, with visible conceptual and off-page human cost. Stakes are somewhat distanced (the dam, metropolis, networks are all offstage), but the sense of a before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: preparation → waiting for alignment → catalytic experiment → realization, with a clear throughline under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is intact (his careful tracking enables the decisive moment), and the closure offers a conceptual repricing of what charisma and “story life” mean. Stakes are mostly confined to the experiment’s success/failure and internal insight, which keeps the arc somewhat low-intensity. The piece lands firmly but not with the sense of a high-cost decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: blockage threatens reality → Elias maps the sorrow with the sextant → timed adjustment shatters it → he repairs the tear → listens to the trees. The storm’s eye and the dropped pin provide a tidy structural peak and turning point, and closure lands clearly with the restored flow and his achieved goal. Cost is somewhat abstract (avoiding a potential rupture) and never bites him personally, which keeps the arc from feeling fully consequential. Still, for this scale, the structure is solid and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: hum → sap → weave → unstable sun → containment → launch → ignition. The piece builds to a clear Decisive Change with the new sun and a resonant sense of cost as Elara collapses, possibly mentally diminished. The single-scene structure is tight, with no orientation issues and no unkept setups. The one limitation is that all complications are anticipated rather than surprising; the path, while strong, feels somewhat pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mistaken invitation → decision to attend → ritual of hiding/staying-while-leaving → arrival at the Athenaeum → reframing of identity. The single structural transition (station dissolving into library) is legible and motivated by the ritual, and orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional shift in how Elian sees his life and abilities, and this before/after is clear. The main limitation is that the stakes and costs remain relatively gentle, so the structural payoff feels more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous progression from street → palace courtyard → tea house → ritual with bread, with each step causally motivated. The accumulative/textural drive is clear, culminating in a quiet but convincing closure where the ritual reconfigures the weight of his guilt and the city’s forgetting (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Stakes remain mostly internal and atmospheric, with no major turn beyond deepening; pressure coheres but never sharply tightens. Still, there are no causality breaks, and the final repositioning of “the sacred endured” lands as a satisfying close.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story tracks a clear causal arc: Elara prepares the device, measures the vows before the magic fades, endures the loss of the illusion, and secures the record. The drive lens reads as mostly causal with an accumulative textural overlay, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—accepting data in place of living magic. Stakes and constraints (fading energy, one chance to verify) are coherent and resolved without cheats. The structure is linear and clean, though the outcome feels foregone, limiting surprise in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s goal leads to the silent negotiation, to her rhythm-disrupting false starts, to Kael’s loss of control and truce-breaking snarl, which enables her to capture the sound. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow; orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the closure (vial capped, she retreats) gives a clear before/after. The main weakness is that her plan unfolds almost too smoothly—there’s little genuine uncertainty that it might fail—so the sense of cost or narrowed options is more conceptual than felt. Still, the decisive change at the truce’s rupture and the secured ingredient satisfy closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: forest elections disrupt navigation → she uses the emergent compass → reaches the bluff → witnesses the convergence → realizes the carriers are the vote’s mechanism → becomes one. The single-scene structure with one transition (through the forest to the bluff) is tight and easy to follow, with no orientation debt. Closure is strong: a clear before/after with both conceptual repricing (understanding the system) and a decisive change (she herself is conscripted). The only limitation is that the pursuit of the Architect of Rain is resolved more as revelation than encounter; the “Architect” functions more as a catalyst than a fully dramatized target.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear progression—arrival in the cave, ritualized waiting, destruction of the lock, creation, then installation of the piece. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: his long repression and memory of ridicule lead to this deliberate, costly ritual. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: before he’s paralyzed and commercially compromised, after he’s bound his liberation to this cave and foreclosed his old life. The cost is emotional and existential rather than plot-heavy, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: map → descent → confrontation → revelation → new plan, with no major logic breaks and a legible before/after in Elara’s role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she repurposes her official gilding work into a covert truth-distribution system, with clear implications and cost. The drive lens is predominantly causal and holds throughout, and the story stays within a single, coherent window of time and space. Escalation is somewhat linear and the clerk’s reversal comes a bit quickly, which slightly softens the sense of hard-earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: sunrise melts the ancient ice, shifts the sculpture’s balance, generates sound, which disrupts the valley’s consensus—this all lands cleanly in one continuous scene. Orientation is strong from the outset (post-Great Quieting world, bluff above the clouds, solstice dawn) and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s “quiet agreement” is reweighted by the engineered shout, with the iceberg’s extinction as price. The main structural limitation is that no late-stage complication or turn tests her plan; once the ice is placed, the outcome feels foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: looming geomagnetic reversal → rising static and memory bleed → retreat to shed and retrieval of the box → transfer, chaos, compression → release and exit. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the single-scene structure maintains focus while delivering a decisive change in Seven’s situation and identity. The cost—shattering the dome, abandoning the roses, and burning his past—is legible and on-page. If anything, the resolution is slightly neat, with survival and “quiet, unified soul” arriving very smoothly after an extreme risk.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (courtyard, demolition threat, iron pillar) and the causal chain is tight: demolition threat → need deed → mailbox mystery → Elara’s listening-based investigation → opening the box → locket-will that halts the foreman. Closure lands with a decisive change in options and status, and the “stories = ownership” repricing is legible. The main softness is how conveniently the holographic will’s legality is asserted and accepted in a single line, with no pushback from the foreman. Still, the core structure is solidly purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → interface setup → dance as access protocol → dice as final confirmation → AI’s liberation. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the story holds a single-scene causal lens without confusion. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a conceptual overlay: the AI is freed and Elara’s role in a long-running containment effort is redefined. The main structural weakness is that the supposed lethal defenses never visibly test her, softening the sense of risk in the central stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: post-whale catastrophe → mission into chamber → navigation via coffee grounds → excavation → gravity crisis → psychic anchoring → partial emotional resolution. Stakes and tactics escalate logically, and the closure (him holding the exhumed memory, reoriented toward the “world of the living”) reads as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation (who/where/what) is firmly established early, and the single continuous scene respects length and scope. If anything, the facility’s larger system (deletion process, governance) stays off-stage, but that doesn’t harm this scene’s closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: hostile night-omens → decision to act → ritual → neutralized prophecy and eased environment. Closure lands as a successful intervention with a quiet before/after, but the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt. Structural tension is modest because nothing meaningfully threatens to derail the ritual once begun.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story is tightly structured as a single rooftop confrontation with a clear causal chain: discovery of the seal → confrontation → revelation of the true nature of the language → decision to accept the role. Orientation is clean from the outset and the drive lens (situational with strong causal underpinnings) holds throughout. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Silas chooses endurance through deception, and the before/after in his stance is legible with conceptual cost. The only limit is that the external threat (the building’s imminent failure) remains more implied than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: entering the garden → confronting the quarantined memory → performing the resonance ritual → waking into a reconfigured life. Closure lands as a decisive change (the memory is archived into the stone, the quarantine collapses, the simulation releases her) with an on-page cost. The global drive feels Hybrid (causal ritual within a lyric, accumulative frame) but remains coherent through the ending. A slightly more palpable sense of risk—what might go wrong or be irretrievably lost beyond the stated aim—could further tighten the stakes and lift the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elian arrives with a clear goal, deploys specific tools, overcomes the magical seal, alters the key word, and re-seals the writ, achieving a decisive change in the prince’s fate and his own moral ledger. The piece maintains single-scene focus, with backstory anchored to present stimuli and always re-aimed toward the current task. Closure lands solidly when “condemned” becomes “commended” and the seal cools, locking in the new reality with a felt history-changing cost, even if consequences remain offstage. The only limitation is that there are no genuine plot-level surprises or complications once the procedure starts, so structure feels elegant but somewhat preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: Elara enters the Nexus, applies progressive acoustic probing, discovers the Archivist’s fate, then captures and departs with his testimony. Closure is strong: the conceptual repricing of “echo” (murder-prison rather than loss) combines with a decisive act (sealing the shell) to create a clear before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with accumulative texture in the layered returns. Stakes and constraints (wards, forbidden chamber) are coherent, though danger remains more implied than dramatized in concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: elusive spirit → dream-archive investigation → pattern recognition → ritualized confrontation and release. The accumulative structure (case-study dreams leading to a re-interpretation of the boy’s act) supports a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. That said, much of the “investigation” is summarized rather than dramatized, softening escalation and making success feel relatively unchallenged. The closure is legible and satisfying but not yet operating at a level of felt cost that top-tier venues typically demand.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: tea ritual → moon-path traversal → whistle experiment → contemplative cooldown, all in one continuous scene. Causality is modest but legible: his philosophy leads to ritual, which leads to the controlled intervention with the fireflies, which delivers the conceptual payoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he proves to himself that a small action can briefly order chaos and feels a deepened kinship with his world. The stakes are small and inward-facing, but the pattern of build and release is well-controlled and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: forbidden orchard → breached lab → shredded letters → missing schematics → improvisational repair → decision to reveal the truth. Orientation is excellent and the closure qualifies as a clear conceptual repricing: the “curse” is recast as deliberate myth with a cost to dismantling it. The only softness is how effortlessly Elias decodes and repairs an advanced, decaying system with limited information, which strains plausibility slightly at this prestige level. Still, the before/after of a failing vs. stabilized sanctuary and the new peril of exposure are legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Silas engineers prophetic broadcasts → Kael rises → variant allegiance emerges → the signal and movement pivot away from Silas → he’s left as spectator, forced into an earned stasis. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual repricing at the end; each development logically follows from the last, and there’s a clear before/after in his power over the signal. The closure beat—dial tone of abandonment and his understanding that he sparked a dawn he can’t share—lands on the page with visible cost. A minor limitation is that some pivotal turns (e.g., the city’s violent blooming) are summarized rather than partially dramatized, which keeps this short of top-tier structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single, accumulating ritual: preparation → timed execution at dawn → aftermath, under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is straightforward and intact—jars prepared, dawn wind arrives, the song is transformed, and Elian’s stance crystallizes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the loft’s silence is “no longer empty,” and his work is reframed from scavenging to salvation. The main limitation is that constraints (risk of failure, social opposition) remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: protect artifact → activate chamber with key → key resists due to psychic pressure → adaptation via vibrational matching → activation and release of sonic absolution. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the single-scene structure holds a clear throughline. Closure lands with an on-page decisive change and cost: the spirits are pacified, the threat neutralized, and Elias is physically shaken and drained. If anything, the solution arrives a bit smoothly once vibrational matching is proposed, with minimal risk of failure dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: frozen lake + rain conductivity + lunar alignment + grounding lever → destabilized viaduct. Orientation (who/where/when) is crystal-clear early, and the piece holds a single continuous scene with no structural confusion. The closure is a decisive change (the bridge’s collapse) with conceptual cost (severed supply line; irrevocable escalation of rebellion). The only limitation is that the “environmental harmonic” and gravitic effect are accepted more on poetic than rigorously dramatized physical logic, which slightly softens the sense of real-world consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: post-drought water → unearthed lantern → infrasound/entangled memories → worker’s death → Elias’s investigation → conflict with Halloway → defiant ruling and upload. Single-scene structure with one vision shard stays coherent and culminates in a decisive on-page change with clear cost. Orientation is solid from the opening and the drive lens (causal with situational pressure) holds to the end. The closure beat—logging the site as heritage and closing the tunnel—feels earned and final without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece is a clean single-scene structure with clear orientation (chaplain enters shop, presents heart, receives diagnosis and revelation). Causality is straightforward: his search for a second opinion leads to the examination, the light-drenched reveal, and the activation of the resonance engine. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “fixing” means, with Elias’s failure reframed in light of the heart’s true workings. Stakes remain tightly focused on this one emotional and moral pivot, which suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: broken sensors → kaleidoscope workaround → arrow-tip data → chassis evolution → workshop collapse → launch → bell. The Great Ascendance is a clear tightening of pressure that forces the long-prepared choice into action, and the final *ding* plus laughter gives an on-page decisive change with conceptual cost (he’s left everything for an essentially private, absurd triumph). Orientation (who/where/what) is strong from the first paragraph, and there are no causality cheats or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → investigation → confrontation with surveillance → completion of the merge → revelation of the black site and crew status. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: his belief about deletion and the nature of “archives” flips with real conceptual cost, and the before/after is legible. The one-scene structure is tight, though the technical leap from layered audio to full coordinates and a hidden partition feels a bit conveniently frictionless at this length. Still, the drive lens (causal mystery-solving) holds from beginning to end without major gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: council demand → metaphysical retreat into lighthouse → mirror search → anomaly captured in shard → proof presented to council. The structure—a single present moment dilated into an inner journey—reads coherent, and the closure unit (Kaelen returns with the shard and shifts the council’s stance) is legible. However, the process unfolds with little friction or uncertainty; the success of his metaphysical tactic feels almost assured once introduced, so the felt cost of the resolution is light. The ending suggests a decisive change but doesn’t dramatize the price or real risk of failure beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a continuous scene in the marina, grounded backstory, and a single pivotal discovery (the parasol tip) that reconfigures his path. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: persistent trawling → chance find → realization → decision to proceed to the clinic. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing where he reframes “the sound of endings” and forecloses the option of continued delay. The only constraint is that external events stay minimal and luck (finding the object) does a fair bit of work, though it feels acceptable in a lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: Elias notices the woman, chooses to approach, offers a metaphor, and she reconfigures her understanding, culminating in releasing the letter scrap. Causality under a situational/causal hybrid lens is straightforward and legible, and the closure (her ability to “wait out the cold”) lands as an on-page reconfiguration with cost. There are no orientation issues; time, place, and stakes are clear from the opening. The arc is somewhat modest, but well-contained for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: oppressive regime → Elian’s mission → traversal of defenses → sentient threshold test → sealing ritual, with a clear before/after once the Pavilion is hidden. The kinetic parapet and the Pavilion’s sentience create logical, escalating gates rather than arbitrary set-pieces. Closure is solid Earned Stasis: the knowledge is preserved, Elian withdraws, and the price is an ongoing, lonely guardianship. The main limitation is that opposition rarely surprises or meaningfully adapts, so turns feel smooth rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: Elian arrives, selects a photograph, performs the alignment ritual, and the ruins are reconfigured into a sculpture-like integration. Causality within the metaphysical logic is consistent, and the closure (the re-seen factory as resilience rather than ruin) reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a mild but legible cost in patience and endurance. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and never seriously endangered, which keeps the structural arc from feeling truly knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from preparation to experiment to realization, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated speaking and refracted echoes tighten toward the conceptual turn that language is alive and the dictionary is a cage. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: he reframes the world’s rule-set and his role in it, and the air “charged with the potential of things that had not yet been named” gives a clear before/after. The main limitation is cost: the danger implied by the law never materializes as a concrete constraint or repercussion, so the risk feels more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: vision → scramble to externalize it → following the self-laid trail → arrival at the crater → experiential closure, with each step causally linked and easy to track. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the closure (Elias locating the source and accepting the slow erasure of both past and future) reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Stakes are internal but coherent, and nothing important is left dangling or patched retroactively. The only drag is that the “quest” has no real possibility of failure once he starts marking driftwood, so structural tension is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: failing timing mechanism → need to align, not stop → delicate recalibration under quake pressure → capture of the Green Flash that reconfigures his ache. The piece delivers closure as a resonant reconfiguration: he doesn’t fix time or grief, but changes their meaning by preserving the moment. Stakes are mostly personal and aesthetic rather than materially consequential, which is fine for this mode but slightly softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: the nurse’s nod → Elias’s ritualized intervention → Clara’s release → the charged silence form a coherent causal arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “flawless goodbye” is achieved at the exact instant of her death, and the final full silence reweights all prior sound. Stakes and cost (her life; his burden of doing this well) are legible and contained within one continuous scene. The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural but still tracks causally, with no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara wants to find where shadows go at noon, therefore she activates the dormant machine, therefore an artificial sun is created, therefore she gains a conceptual answer and then chooses to shut it down. The story holds a single continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors, and the observatory’s rules (memory loss, looped logic) remain consistent. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the nature of shadows is redefined, and the final act of turning the key back closes both the literal circuit and the experiment’s arc, with the cost of inevitable forgetting. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and metaphysical rather than materially dire, but they are coherent and resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from discovery of the wooden body and tooth to the decisive arrival of the parents and Aris’s chosen interpretation. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the tooth revelation alters his options, his preparation shapes his stance, and the parents’ entrance forces his closure choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he refuses a simple death declaration and instead redefines the body as “map rather than corpse,” with the cost of embracing terrifying, uncertain hope. All anchors (who/where/when) are clear, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens: fog pushes her underground; polishing triggers traumatic memory; she grounds herself, completes the gem, weighs it, and tests its light. Causality is clean and orientation never falters, and the weighing beat adds a small but concrete procedural turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she successfully manifests a cold, guiding light that answers the earlier fire trauma—though the cost is mostly emotional and lightly sketched. The structure is coherent but limited to a single, modest intensification, which holds it below elite-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a causal spine (meltwater pattern → pendant → Mara) and a legible before/after in the closing charged poise. The accumulative drive (silence, moss, thaw) coheres and closure lands in the reconfigured silence between them. The arrow of water verges on conveniently symbolic guidance but doesn’t break plausibility. Stakes and options are relatively narrow, so the structural turn feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: mist nexus → intrusion into a single crucial scene → return to nexus with a reweighted understanding. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative lens—his prior failures and guilt motivate this specific intervention, which in turn alters his collection and self-concept. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the book’s tragedy proceeds unchanged, but the meaning of those tragedies is repriced by his secret archive of hopes. The only minor limitation is that the “physics” of this metafictional world stay more suggested than fully articulated, though they never break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: neglected rituals → bitter crops → Elian’s invention and grafting → song-powered activation at a precise celestial alignment → golden stories shifting the village’s future stance. Orientation is strong from the opening, with clear who/where/when and a single, continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world after the ritual is subtly but decisively reweighted, with a visible cost (spent vine, Elian’s exhaustion) and a charged new possibility for the village. Stakes could feel sharper or more directly tested on the page, but the structure itself is sound and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene with a clear before (dead orchard, inert plate) and after (charged map, departure). Causality is tight and legible—each physical step in the process follows from the last and leads to the flash and the humming plate. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard’s “heartbeat” has been captured and Silas leaves, carrying the cost and meaning with him. What keeps it short of top tier is the relative ease of the process: no meaningful complication, reversal, or risk of failure ever troubles the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous operation in the cavern that moves from preparation to execution to aftermath, with clear causal links. The drive lens reads as accumulative/causal—weeks of study → building the device → activating it → emptied cavern and departure. Closure is strong as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world has shifted from a charged, echo-laden space to dead geology with the wonder sealed in his pocket, an on-page cost. The main limitation is that the process unfolds smoothly with no real risk or complication, keeping the causal arc somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene moving from immersion in the weave to a crisis of instability and a contained resolution via the lamp and starlight. Causality is tight and legible—each step (“volatile knot” → risk of being lost → reach for conduit → precise alignment → calcification) follows. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: the regret is transformed and archived, the hush reasserts itself, and she is reset but not fundamentally changed. The cost—ongoing emotional labor and risk—is implied rather than escalated to a decisive, transforming price, which keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece adheres cleanly to a single-scene structure framed by the kettle’s boil, with each phase of the ritual logically following from the last under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure beat—kettle whistle snapping her out of “crystallized time” and returning her to ordinary movement—lands as an Earned Stasis with visible cost (she has ceded a part of Silas to the wood and to memory). Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the reflective passages are well-anchored in present stimuli. The only ceiling here is that the turn is conceptually subtle rather than structurally daring, so the before/after is more tonal than option-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: scavenging → acquisition of leverage (voices) → negotiation with ghost → revelation of self-sabotage → collapse into regret. Orientation is solid; the surreal world is clear enough and the story maintains a single continuous scene with no structural confusion. Closure is strong via a decisive change in knowledge and a conceptual repricing of the entire premise (“It was not a mechanical failure; it was his own sabotage”), with clear cost. The only structural softness is that the negotiation itself unfolds very straightforwardly, with little complication or surprise once the terms are stated.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the sextant → decision to resurrect the hologram → rerouting power → improvising with the sextant → successful projection. The piece lands a solid conceptual repricing at the end, reframing the terminal and the sextant as proof that decay isn’t final. Cost is mostly implied (risk, solitude, the effort of caring in a neglected place) rather than dramatized, which keeps the closure a bit bloodless. Still, the single-scene structure is coherent and proportionate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: rain → scent → memory → forbidden forecourt → tactile communion → internal reckoning → return. Causality is intact and legible, with no orientation issues; the piece understands itself as a single, continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he confronts the cost of his vow and recommits, leaving “his ghost behind,” providing a clear before/after in stance. The only limit is that the treasonous risk of visiting the forecourt is never concretely tested or complicated, so structurally the pressure never tightens beyond the single, anticipated communion.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: illicit salvage → retrieval of hull plate → confirmation of internal explosion → sundial verification → renunciation by returning the evidence. The radio’s cutoff and sunrise provide a tight structural spine and a clear closure beat with an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he opts for possession of truth over public revelation. All key set-ups (sundial, rumor vs noon theory, winch, radio) pay off; the only limit is that the cost of his choice remains mostly conceptual, not materially pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single continuous scene, clear orientation, and a clean accumulative structure: arrival → inspection → decoding → departure. The closure unit—a successful reading and quiet earned stasis where the method survives in one man—is legible. Causality is modest but present (cold, fog, and the complexity of the knot all pressure his process). The cost at closure is more implied (isolation, obscurity) than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: arrival in a liminal season, engagement with the Countess’s void, the ritual of writing/reading, and a quiet but legible closure as she accepts her solitude differently. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: atmosphere, images, and the act of writing build toward a reconfiguration rather than a plotted reversal. Causality is modest but coherent—his technique and text lead directly to her bodily and emotional release. The cost is felt in her melancholy acceptance and his continued “wanderings,” though the stakes remain intimate rather than sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term project → assembling the device → activation → hatching → realization of the world’s unfitness for life, culminating in a conceptual repricing of his goal. Single-scene structure with one dominant stake keeps orientation and momentum clear, and closure lands decisively with cost as he cups the dying bird. The backstory about the ancestors’ flawed logic is well-timed and directly informs the ending. The arc is strong but relatively straightforward, without a major structural surprise or secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene causal arc: assemble the graft → submerge it → wait → hum emerges, proving the experiment worked. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early despite the lyricism, so there’s no navigational debt. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s response (the hum) reweights her history with her father and confirms her drive. Stakes are intimate rather than dramatic, but the structure supports them without sag or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: geese pausing → auditory “breadcrumbs” → Grand Cistern → cosmic alignment → twist and release → memories restored and geese resume. Closure is decisive and legible, with the world clearly different after the box is freed and history flows again. The drive lens is Causal with a light conceptual accent, and the story holds it consistently. The main limitation is that the solution unfolds exactly as anticipated, with no meaningful jeopardy or complication once the rules are stated.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: gear → journey through nebula → reaching the stalled axle → inserting the gear → machine reanimates → emotional cost. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing: the universe’s light-source shifts, and Xylos’s role becomes obsolete. The structure is essentially one long approach-and-climax scene, with no confusing jumps and a legible before/after. The main limitation is that almost no obstacles or reversals complicate the transit, so the middle feels more like extended description than tightening plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece has a clean single-scene structure with an accumulative/textural drive: greenhouse lessons → moth measurement → conceptual re-seeing of grief → applied in carving. Causality is coherent, and the closure (reframing grief as a knot and then carving accordingly) is on the page with conceptual cost. The escalation is quiet—weeks are summarized, and the night’s task is a modest intensification rather than a sharp turn—so the sense of narrowing options is more implied than felt. Still, the before/after is legible and thematically satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: a wrongness in the clock’s rhythm compels Silas to risk a live adjustment during the pendulum’s pause, culminating in a partial mechanical and spiritual correction. Orientation (who/where/when) is quickly and vividly anchored and never lost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: time is “healed” to match truth, and a measurable portion of his burden has been worn away at visible cost. The single-scene structure is tight and appropriate to the scale of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: timer stops → Silas examines the chaotic tapestry → he works the border → discovers the sovereign case → reads the note → the tapestry resolves into a comprehensible image. The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens and delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end (rage reweighted as hope) with a legible before/after. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than emotional, and the stakes—understanding a stranger’s intentions—remain somewhat low-intensity. Still, the scene is structurally sound and self-contained, with no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene building to the single decisive act of touching pen to vellum, with clear causal logic from models → plan → doubt → resolve → write. Orientation is solid early on, and the predictive models plus the proposed shortage give the decision a tangible framework. Closure functions as a charged poise: once ink flows, options collapse and a year’s trajectory is fixed, with stagnation as the conceptual cost. The piece leans heavily on exposition rather than dramatized complications, which flattens potential structural tension but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clear single-scene arc: tuning the broadcast → transcription and luminous reaction → approaching patrol → concealment and plan for dissemination. Causality is clean and legible under an accumulative/textural lens, with the pirate signal and violet glow directly generating the crisis that forces Elian’s choice. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: he commits to continuing his slow, invisible rebellion despite the immediate risk. Structure is strong but not intricate; escalation is effective yet relatively straightforward, keeping it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a tight causal sequence: arrival → grinding → drawing → timed destruction → aftermath, all motivated by the ritual and Elara’s hope. Closure is strong: the decisive act of blowing the portrait away, timed to the rocker’s halt, produces a clear before/after in Elara’s stance with visible cost (her scream, the vanished image). The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal ritual within an accumulative, atmospheric frame) and holds through the ending. There are no orientation issues or dangling set-ups; everything seeded early pays off in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Silas needs the cog → excavates the workshop → finds and refines it → installs it → the clock begins ticking, audibly challenging the surface dogma. The piece maintains a single, coherent scene with no orientation issues, and every step narrows options toward the mechanical test of the priests’ myth. Closure lands solidly: the world now contains an audible, ongoing refutation of “time has stopped,” which conceptually reconfigures the survivors’ reality. The cost is primarily conceptual/social rather than immediate physical danger, but it’s legible in the line that he has “started a war without saying a word.”

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the lesson builds from listening to focused silence to the brief emergence of collective sound, then collapses. The closure—one transcendent minute of harmony followed by a return to stillness and loss—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. Causality is coherent under the lyrical lens; each instruction intensifies or clarifies the central experiment rather than wandering. The main limitation is that the “impossible” achievement and its aftermath are somewhat under-complicated by counterforces or alternatives that might sharpen the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal arc is clean: plant seed → over-absorption of trauma → pruning to redirect memory pathways → creation of healing fruit, with the celestial alignment as a ticking clock. Closure is solidly on the page: he tastes the reconfigured fruit and lands in a new, earned stasis with his quiet act of defiance. The structure is straightforward but effective, with no orientation issues or broken set-ups. The external legal stakes are underused in scene, so the on-page cost feels mostly internal/technical rather than narratively sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a clean causal line: blackout → Kael’s arrival → toll/riddle delay → box reveal → acceptance of permanent failure. Closure is strong via a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: there will be no restart, and both men must live with the new dark and its beauty. Stakes and constraints (no backup, irreversible ash) feel concrete and final. The only structural softness is how smoothly Kael yields to the aesthetic revelation, which trims some edge from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and causal: walk → discovery of root → application of his method → atmospheric shift → outsider’s comment → realization and departure. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with enough causal spine to keep orientation and stakes clear. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he redefines what “aliveness” in a house means—and this before/after is legible and motivated. The cost is primarily conceptual (recognition of decay and contradiction), which is appropriate for the mode but limits the sense of high-stakes consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Elara arrives with a thesis → Caelum demonstrates an alternate reading via the arch mechanism → cascading revelations force her to re-price the “poison” and her mission → she commits to a new course. The single continuous scene, tight focus, and one major turn (murder vs mercy reframed) suit the length and keep orientation solid. Closure functions as a strong conceptual repricing and charged poise rather than a fully enacted decisive change, but the before/after is legible with moral cost implied. The only limitation is that downstream consequences of waking or not waking remain largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: understanding the staircase’s energy logic leads to the plan with the chipped die, which triggers the rupture and escape, with no glaring gaps. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with a clear before/after and a decisive change at the end, and the cost (risk of erasure, physical pain as reality tears) is legible on the page. Expository explanation of the thermodynamic “hack” edges close to info-dump but remains integrated enough with his tactics to avoid bogging the structure. Overall, the global drive and closure are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: preparation with the brush and moon, the act of painting, the wait, then the answering signal and emotional release. Causality is tight and legible under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—the ritual leads to the ideogram, which leads to the light answering from the city. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his isolation is reweighted by proof of connection, granting him earned rest. Cost is present but somewhat underplayed; the years of insomnia and emotional risk are implied more than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from anticipation of thaw to an adaptive response and a charged final image. Causality is solid: the missing beekeeper → no wax → impending thaw → humidity threat → pivot to edible alphabet. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (accepting loss of scrolls, preserving words in bodies), and the cost (sacrifice of vellum history) is legible. The drive lens reads primarily as accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings, and that hybrid holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation is clear early: lighthouse, hunger stone, low tide, Elias at work, and the causal chain from stone → plan → modified lighthouse → reversal is legible throughout. The piece builds to a decisive change—the machine activates and the tide (and implied fate) reverse—so closure lands. However, the resolution feels almost too frictionless: everything works on first try with no setback or complication, and the cost of rewriting tides and “destiny” is left purely conceptual. For a top-tier venue, one more beat of resistance or consequence would deepen the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: resuscitation → altered perception and bound fear → entering the funhouse with a plan → navigating via paradoxical notes → mirror confrontation → confession that starves the entity and collapses the void. Closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change: the void implodes, the atmosphere normalizes, and the lingering luminance vanishes, clearly marking a before/after with cost. The single-scene structure is clean, with no orientation debt, and the drive lens (causal, primarily internal) holds throughout. If anything, the material cost to Elias himself (beyond a burned palm and psychic shift) could be a touch sharper, but the emotional price of admitting he didn’t want to return is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm signaled by clouds → Elara chooses her sonic method → builds the fractal shield → channels storm into music → storm passes. This yields a clear before/after and a coherent Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the world’s rule (“turn fury into song”) is proven on the page. Stakes (the orchard’s survival) are present and followed through, although the narrative rarely flirts with genuine structural failure or an alternative outcome. The naming moment slightly blurs whether “dub” is just a flourish or a necessary causal mechanic, but it does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: a locked gate and autonomous turtles → brother’s lost expedition and the whistle → Elara’s pattern analysis pointing to the Watchers → whistle-blow → horizon’s reply → fissure revealing machinery → conceptual flip from faith to operators and cargo. The story adheres to a causal drive lens, and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s nature and the sun/Watchers are redefined with a clear, unsettling cost. The final beat (“key to a cage she was never meant to understand”) crystallizes the before/after without over-explaining. The only thing holding it short of top-tier is that the immediate forward consequence of her act (what she will now do or lose) remains entirely off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scene is tightly structured around a single causal drive: the armistice clock runs out, so Elara confronts the Censor to obtain the Illuminated Letter and succeeds. Because/therefore links are clean (petal falls → grace period over → she escalates from observation to confrontation → Censor yields), and the ending provides a decisive change plus conceptual repricing (history recaptured; peace’s foundations redefined). The cost—that truth will hurt and destabilize—is explicit and thematically integrated in the gardening metaphor. The only slight softness is how swiftly the Censor yields after one rhetorical push, thinning the sense of last-ditch resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: drawbridge rises → Elias goes to pavilion → writes memory → clears fissure → embeds vial → reflects on his purpose. The story lands a clear closure unit as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: we end with the reweighted vision of the city’s future archaeology shaped by his choices. Structure is simple but apt: one continuous night’s work culminating in a single successful insertion of grief into stone. The main limitation is that the stakes and options never significantly narrow beyond “perform the ritual or not,” so the structural arc feels more like a beautifully rendered demonstration than a genuine test.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal drive is tight: blackout → lost vibrations → chance to test hypothesis → stamp alignment → revelation → decision to act. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the entire city’s myth, with the turbine’s restart providing a clean temporal and symbolic hinge between stillness/clarity and resumed illusion. Stakes and tactics remain coherent within one continuous scene, and the ending decisively reconfigures Elian’s options. The only limitation is that the suffocation threat remains largely hypothetical rather than actively closing in, so temporal pressure never quite peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: one compressed scene moves causally from polishing → capturing the dream → transforming it → release, with no dropped threads. Orientation (who/where/when and the metaphysical rules) is established quickly and stays consistent, and the “hour after the shadow detaches” functions as an effective ticking clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot save Elara but sends his grief/dream after her in a new form. The only limitation is the lack of a mid-scene complication or reversal that would deepen the causal pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: blackout → opportunity → experiment → contact with the “unhappened” → interruption by breakers → renewed, darker commitment. The piece lands a solid Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he loses the connection, pays an emotional cost, then decides to keep breaking the system. Backstory is efficiently woven and directly motivates present action rather than stalling it. The drive lens (causal with accumulative lyric texture) holds consistently through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: Elara navigates by star trails to the observatory, discovers the Pilgrim with the chip, takes it at cost, and uses it to decode the signal, producing a clear before/after shift. The story keeps to a single continuous scene with no orientation issues and a coherent Causal drive lens. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she sacrifices the Pilgrim’s function to gain her own completed narrative of origin. The only limitation is that the Pilgrim’s prior off-page quest is gestured at but not structurally leveraged beyond set-dressing and the chip’s presence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clear: Elian goes to the shore to confront a specific past crime, engages with the driftwood and its false memories, and finds the watch hand that forces a reckoning. The structure is cleanly linear with one continuous scene and a focused drive toward closure. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing when he accepts that he cannot restore the boy but chooses to carry the truth instead. A slightly higher score would require one more concrete external complication or choice affecting his options, but the current design is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrival on the neutral parapet → setup of the enchanted mechanism and lunar timing → sudden mechanical failure → improvisation with the drawer pull → successful untethering and emotional reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening, and the magical rules are minimal but consistent enough for the stakes of the backlash to feel legible. Closure lands as a decisive change—both in the prisoner’s status and in Silas’s relationship to his past mistake—without loose plot threads. The only limit on an even higher score is that the resolution after the improvisation proceeds a bit smoothly, with little further resistance once the object fits.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: from paralysis at launch, through adoption of a new navigation method, to a quieter but decisive acceptance in motion. Causality is simple but coherent—fog, regret, and prior catastrophe make open water untenable, pushing him toward the utility poles as an alternative. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he renounces the old path (astronomical navigation/open bay) in favor of shore-hugging with a legible emotional cost. There are no significant orientation issues, though the escalation is more meditative than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal line is clean: elevator descent → arrival at Oracle lake → confrontation with timelines → decision to sacrifice the baseball, with each step tightening the focus on his core goal. Closure is solidly a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: he moves from engineered numbness to painful empathy, paying a clear price by relinquishing the proof of time travel. The single-scene structure is coherent and temporally clear, with no orientation issues. If anything, the “newspaper code → sanctuary” step is glossed over, feeling more like a cool premise hook than an integrated structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: conjuring the scented smoke draws the phoenix, which in turn triggers the metamorphosis and climactic contact. The piece maintains a tight single-scene structure, with the backstory fortune integrated briefly and functionally. Closure lands clearly when recognition returns and the fortune burns, marking a before/after in their bond with a paid bodily price. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light textural overlay, and it holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean single-ritual structure: ascent → preparation → activation of magic → revelation → refusal. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he reaches the truth and actively chooses not to internalize it, foreclosing genuine repentance with clear cost. Causality is tight (each ritual step enables the next beat), and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues. The only ceiling is that the turn is psychologically powerful but structurally relatively simple—no secondary complication or aftershock on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: need to open the door → earlier failure → requirement of resonance → shadow work → stitching ritual → door opens. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—he endures psychic agony to gain wholeness and passage. The single-scene structure on the ship is coherent, with backstory tightly tied to present stakes and no orientation debt. If anything, the door yields a bit quickly once the inner work is complete, keeping escalation solid rather than breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story tracks a clean causal chain: cosmological conjunction + hush → detour → bug release → volcano soothed → internal repricing of transformation. Coincidences are acknowledged and thematized rather than hidden, which stabilizes the logic under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure is solid: Silas ends having genuinely lost his last possession and gained a reweighted understanding of change, with a clear before/after. Stakes and costs could be made slightly sharper by foregrounding what’s truly at risk for him personally in the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: blackout → opportunity → sundial mechanism → Cradle activation → altered surveillance feeds. Single-scene focus and clear spatial anchors in the garden and fort make the structure easy to follow, and the ending delivers a decisive change in the fort’s relationship to power. The closure as a conceptual and infrastructural shift (“no longer a cage of light, but a lantern of secrets”) lands on the page. Cost is more implied than dramatized—her risk and what she forecloses aren’t fully tested—which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single, causal scene: Oren constructs the device, lures the eel, harnesses it, and achieves a localized restoration of friction. Setup and payoff are tightly linked (stones → eel attraction → gravity well → stillness), and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a clear cost (it’s temporary; he’ll return to drift). The only limitation is that the operation proceeds almost exactly as forecast without a complicating turn, which keeps the structure from feeling fully knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the resistance dead-drop leads him to the map, the special hour and timer dictate the procedure, the solvent reveals the red lines, producing his reconfiguration at the end. Structure is simple but solid: one continuous scene with backstory anchored to present stimuli and no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his stance toward fear and truth—clearly tied to the revealed map. The main limitation is that the hinted external danger (regime risk) never materially constrains or complicates the on-page procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: waiting for armistice talks → duel as pressure and “language” → need to decode sundial → use of tin → revelation of northern door → shift from combat to alignment. Closure is a clear Decisive Change: Silas and Kael move from active opposition to mutual understanding and a shared path, with the future negotiation reconfigured. Stakes (war vs peace) are largely conceptual but adequately grounded in the immediate risk of lethal fencing during the decoding. Structure is tight and single-scene, with no orientation issues or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear and coherent: a single continuous scene moving from anticipation to planting to a charged final image. Causality is straightforward (they meet, reveal the tin, plant the seeds) and the closure—“It is beginning”—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens. Stakes and risk (sedition, patrols) are mostly implied rather than tested, so the decisive change is more conceptual than pressured. Still, the before/after of the act of planting is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: fraying reality → decision not to evacuate → constructing the projector-portal → entering the film-world → playing the encore as time runs out. The speculative rule (entering cut segments of a film by manipulating frame rate and music) is introduced before it matters and followed through without late-breaking cheats. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot escape destruction, but he changes its terms, making the end an aesthetic triumph rather than a passive erasure. Cost is legible in his acceptance that the pocket dimension and performance are strictly finite.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: monsoon deadline → need for real bedrock → kaleidoscope assessment → dream-vision trap and pulse discovery → awakening the rock → planting and shielding the sprout. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost despite the hallucinatory setting. Closure is strong and legible as a decisive change: the island’s illusions are stripped, the seed takes root, and Elian’s stance settles into uneasy endurance. The single-scene structure is tight and appropriate to the length, with no dangling setups or contrived resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene that escalates from preparation (compass, lace) through activation (needle freezing, tides rising) to payoff (indigo light, settled needle). Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: decoding lace → stabilizing needle → confronting voices → manifesting the color → emotional release. Closure is clear and earned, with a before/after in his psychic state and a concrete endpoint in the compass pointing toward peace. The only limitation is the near-frictionless ritual—there is little sense it might fail once begun.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative arc, moving from macro destruction to microscopic scrutiny, then reconfiguring the protagonist's worldview. Closure lands with a physical action—touching the dust—that solidifies the Conceptual Repricing with undeniable weight and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and satisfying; the protagonist transforms a passive constraint (waiting) into an active forensic tool using her specific knowledge. The closure lands effectively as a Decisive Change in tactics—from hiding to hunting—earned by the successful application of the thermal theory.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the inciting cold spot to the resolution of warmth. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the conservatory's state. The stakes are relatively linear—a repair job with a brief internal hurdle—but the structure is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path from problem to solution, with a functional backstory block establishing the inciting incident (the package). Closure is definite and legible, but the resolution—inserting a shard to instantly solve the conflict—feels mechanical and lacks a complication or "twist" that usually characterizes higher-band plots. The ease of the fix ("instantaneous and absolute") lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative forms a coherent vignette with clear orientation and a legible "Earned Stasis" closure via the ritual. However, the scene lacks causal density or a moment of doubt; the plan proceeds exactly as intended without on-page disruption, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: problem, method, immediate success, epiphany. There are no setbacks, complications, or failures to test the protagonist's competence; the ghost complies instantly, and the magic works on the first attempt. The closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, but because the victory is so easily won, the structural weight is light.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story relies on a linear "problem plus magic artifact equals solution" structure. While the closure is a Decisive Change, the resolution feels convenient, as the "halo fragment" dissolves the conflict without forcing the protagonist to pay a visible, felt cost or make a difficult trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves solid closure with the sealing of the vault and Elias's acceptance of his fate. However, the mechanical logic of the climax—sorting loose keys into a Fibonacci spiral during a violent raid—strains plausibility and pacing. The "arrow in the piano pedal" mechanism is inventive but spatially confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear process arc (Accumulative/Textural lens) where the steps of creation build to a successful imprint. Closure is definitive—the device is created—and the "ghost in the machine" provides a resonant conceptual reconfiguration of the task. The structure is sturdy, though it lacks a jagged causal turn or complication; the "fleeting phase" acts as a functional clock rather than a source of unexpected trouble.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect chain, effectively setting up the reveal. However, the closure functions primarily as a "next chapter" hook—a prologue to a larger story—rather than a resolved beat with a visceral, paid-on-the-page cost, relying instead on a standard twist of perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally driven, moving efficiently from the inciting pressure (glacier boom) to a clear Decisive Change (abandonment). The orientation is immediate, and the closure—leaving the sanctuary to save the work—lands with a tangible cost (the large dome left behind).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear countdown driving the pace. While the presence of the cast on the console is a convenient coincidence, the story earns the resolution by forcing Elias to actively decode it under pressure rather than simply reading it. The reversal of the "sanctuary protocols" provides a satisfying, causal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the dying star as an effective ticking clock that drives the pacing. Closure is definitive and resonant, offering a Decisive Change where the external chaos resolves into a completed internal and physical state (the finished map).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is a clean, tight procedural shard with a legible beginning, middle, and end. Closure is achieved through Earned Stasis—the job is done, the search failed—landing with a clear conceptual cost (the destruction of the beautiful vessel).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and functional, with a clear inciting incident and a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the burden is shared. The use of the lens as a causal mechanism is established early, ensuring the resolution follows the story's internal logic. However, the progression is linear and lacks a moment where the plan genuinely threatens to fail; the transition from suspicion to trust is smooth and slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a precise Causal lens where the protagonist's specific physical actions dismantle the antagonist's statistical worldview. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, validating the "mended deception" with a tangible, physics-based victory that feels earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving efficiently from setup to execution to closure. The ending achieves a valid Earned Stasis, where Elian returns to his routine changed by knowledge. The causality is tight, though the climax relies slightly on the external timing of the nexus rather than a forcing character decision.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a static opening to a resonant closure via a clear, if magical, causal chain. The transition from the water kicking to the map forming relies heavily on supernatural convenience ("steered by the ghost’s will"), but the internal dream-logic holds. The closure (Charged Poise) lands effectively, changing his state from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal; the inciting incident (realization of the truth post-fever) leads directly to a binary crisis and a clever, lateral resolution. The closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration: the immediate panic is averted by technical manipulation, but the cost is permanently shifted to Elias's isolation, satisfying the requirement for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a high-magnitude coincidence—a random radio caller confessing the exact thematic answer Silas needs—to resolve the central mystery. While the "radio mapping" concept sets this up, the timing makes the resolution feel given by chance rather than earned by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, successfully delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration ending where the protagonist changes state. However, the mechanism of transition is convenient ("laws of physics bent"), bypassing causal friction; the protagonist resolves the crisis with a magical tool that works instantly, lowering the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path where the climax is triggered by external events (the eclipse) rather than protagonist agency. While orientation is clear, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, and the closure lacks a tangible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation path (enter, climb, read, solve) without significant causal complication or reversal. The closure—the structure "relaxing" after being acknowledged—is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a dramatized shift in stakes or a visible price paid by the protagonist. The convenience of finding the exact diary and tapestry required to solve the mystery flattens the trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid: the prophetic danger forces Arthur to act, leading to a decisive change at the climax (disrupting the light). The closure lands with a clear change in status (resignation) and implied cost (loss of safety). The connection between the prophecy and the specific method of resolution (spinning the light) is functional but slightly symbolic rather than strictly tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clear and logical, utilizing the loop pedal mechanics to drive the plot toward a decisive change. However, the narrative arc is linear; Kellen applies techniques that work immediately without significant setback or forced adaptation, which flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a ritual that succeeds perfectly, lacking a decisive turn or a felt cost at closure. While the orientation and sequence are clear, the ending ("fortune... had come true") offers symmetric satisfaction where the protagonist gets exactly what he wants without sacrifice, reducing narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, effectively compressing a metaphysical journey into a single, tension-filled scene. The synchronization of the landing with the water droplet provides a crisp, tangible lock-in for the closure, satisfying the "Decisive Change" criteria with high precision. The logic of the world—retracing to solidify reality—holds up under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, coherent accumulative arc that successfully lands a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (numbness to sorrow). While effective, the "magical ritual" structure simplifies the causality into a straight line without significant complications or branching options.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causality is tight, moving efficiently from the arrival to the breach and escape without unearned leaps. The closure lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the physical lab is sacrificed for the safety of the message, paying a clear on-page cost. The sequence of the climb is well-anchored in the physical space established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a clear hypothesis to an experimental climax and a resonant conclusion. The closure—verifying the physical nature of the memory while accepting its loss—lands with earned conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a strong causal line to a legible Decisive Change closure where the protagonist abandons his quest. The cost is clearly established through the smoking rope and the physical pain, satisfying the closure requirement under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative arc is coherent, successfully building from the lighting of the fire to the musical climax. The closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence) lands clearly, though the narrative relies on a linear ritual structure with low causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, following a clear diagnosis-treatment-effect causality that leads to a legible Decisive Change for the client. The "half-truth" concept allows for a nuanced resolution where the cost (sedation masquerading as wisdom) is conceptually distinct and paid on the page. Orientation is immediate and the pacing supports the procedural focus.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where the declared difficulty (fear of connection) is resolved instantly by a compliant interaction. This exemplifies "symmetric satisfaction," where the conflict dissolves without a meaningful obstacle or unforeseen complication to test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear structure with immediate orientation and a defined objective (the search). The progression from the boy's injury to the discovery of the tag builds a coherent ritualistic arc. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "cost" of her acceptance feels relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with excellent pacing, moving efficiently from setup to the specific "interrupted cadence" complication. The drive lens is strictly causal, and the closure lands a decisive change with an undeniable physical cost. The constraint of the giant’s waking cycle perfectly shapes the tactics and the final escape.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear causal path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure; the result (data, not daughter) lands with legible cost. The drive lens is consistent, utilizing the ritual's logic to reach a meaningful, if cerebral, reconfiguration of the protagonist's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight, with the power outage organically providing both the discovery of the tape and the cover needed to deliver it. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "shared discovery" permanently alters the dynamic of isolation without breaking the story's reality. The "window of opportunity" provided by the strobe lights creates a precise, earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight; the move from greenhouse to yard is physically motivated by the oxygen levels. The pivot from resistance to surrender is earned by the physical locking of his joints, though the realization moment is slightly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight, moving efficiently from the inciting rain to the discovery and trade. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's view on decay—is structurally sound and lands with distinct conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, but the causality relies heavily on the "helpful universe" intervening. The mechanism of the "shadow bridge" is inventive, but the resolution happens *to* the protagonist rather than *by* her, weakening the causal chain of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a convenient contrivance—Elian happens to have the exact necessary valve in his pocket—which bypasses the need for causal effort or ingenuity. The resolution is immediate and total, lacking the friction, setbacks, or costs required to earn the emotional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear quest structure that successfully integrates the prompt's diverse elements. The causality is solid—one step logically enables the next—but the progression feels somewhat mechanical, like a series of locks and keys, rather than an escalating organic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path from discovery to resolution without meaningful complication or reversal. While the closure lands a decisive stance shift, the mechanism (magic square mapping to whales) relies on convenient magical realism that the protagonist accepts too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal progression; the "spatial mutiny" provides tangible resistance that escalates the scene naturally. The closure is a decisive, irreversible change that follows logically from the established mechanics of the storm and amulet.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the ink) to dissolve the central conflict instantly, bypassing meaningful struggle or tactical improvisation. The resolution is a transaction that lacks a palpable sense of risk or difficulty, making the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—setup, execution, and success—without a decisive change or meaningful complication to the plan. Closure is achieved through task completion rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost; the ending feels like a "job well done" rather than a narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure—find, process, release—that lacks a complication to force a deviation or heightened cost. While the closure lands an atmospheric image, the lack of causal friction or significant turning point results in a vignette rather than a pressurized story arc.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear shift in stance. The grade is limited because the climax dissolves into summary ("He heard his university mentor... admitting"), telling the reader the breakthrough occurred rather than showing it unfold in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—reconfiguring the city to stall eviction—lands effectively. However, the resolution relies on a somewhat convenient legal loophole regarding the "foundation stone" that strains plausibility, acting as a "magic gavel" rather than a grounded plot mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight and causal, with the chemical countdown providing effective pressure. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the permanent loss of night is balanced by the captured image, landing with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural arc (problem, diagnosis, repair, success) that lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at closure. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through risk, and the ending offers a "job done" stasis without the required felt or conceptual cost to mark a true narrative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a situational lens, moving from the falcon's signal to the ritualistic climax. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the map's transience is accepted as its validity—lands with clarity. The causality of the magic system (breath on cold glass) is established early via the setting, making the resolution feel earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, following a clear restorative trajectory that lands on a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (temporary stability against inevitable collapse). The "magic system" of the tuning fork is established and paid off logically within the scene's window. The causality of the intervention—using rhythm to counter discord—is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from the distress signal constraint to the physical obstacle (knot) and final release. Closure is definitive and resonant, reconfiguring the protagonist's state from intruder to permanent resident with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from the inciting pressure (wreckage) to the resolution (escape). While the "strange geometry" justifies the exit, the solution feels somewhat low-friction; Elian discovers a magical exit through focus rather than a costly trade-off or tactical maneuver, making the closure feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Structure is solid with a clear Decisive Change (sickness cured) and legible closure. The "past life debt" explanation acts as a mid-climax informational patch that slows momentum, but the causality of the bead-for-cure transaction holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path where the magic thread and trance resolve the conflict without complication or unexpected cost. While the closure (the healed fissure) is legible, it feels inevitable rather than earned through a decisive, hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure without significant reversal or complication; the discovery and repair proceed with convenient ease. The logic of a working sundial inside a deep catacomb relies on a fortunate fissure that strains credibility, and the resolution provides symmetric satisfaction rather than earned, costly closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path (signal -> creation -> dispatch) that fits the Situational lens, resulting in a stable "Charged Poise" closure. The structure is competent, though the pacing is uniform; the "rush" indicated by the chalk code doesn't translate into urgent narrative propulsion, keeping the tension relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal arc is tight and effective, moving from deception to a decisive, irrevocable act of sabotage that fundamentally alters the situation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the "rippling" map and "jagged crimson light" serve as a tangible manifestation of the coup's undoing with clear stakes attached.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear path, but the climax hinges on the convenient arrival of moonlight ("As if on cue") rather than protagonist agency. The resolution—a message appearing in condensation—solves the central conflict externally, bypassing a more demanding causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the closure lacks the required "visible or felt cost." The resolution—altering the cast to "unknot" the trauma—is a "soft reset" that symbolically fixes the problem without consequence or sacrifice. The drive lens is situational, but the lack of opposition or trade-off makes the ending feel unearned and overly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes loop: entry, immediate success, and exit. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the protagonist wakes up refreshed without paying a visible price or facing a complication. The cause-and-effect chain lacks resistance; the magic solves the problem instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is tight, effectively utilizing the "occurrence in a split second" frame without feeling cheap. The transitions between the nested realities follow a dream logic that remains coherent under the story's established rules. The closure is decisive, with the final answer serving as a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the initial conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.2)
    The resolution relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the gourd seed) that is introduced moments before its use to conveniently solve the central conflict. The causality between the "flower language" setup and the "sonic weapon" payoff is disjointed; the former explains the meeting, but the latter resolves it without character agency or sacrifice. The ending (walking away free) lacks a visible, felt cost on the page, resulting in a "clean win" that lowers literary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a coherent linear structure, using the ritual as a vessel for the narrative arc, and the closure—burying the postcard to achieve peace—creates a legible change in state. The orientation within the shell is strong, anchoring the reader immediately. However, the "magic" functions as a convenient accelerator for the resolution, smoothing over the causal difficulty of letting go without imposing a distinct, unforeseen cost beyond the loss of the object.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear repair procedural: discovery, diagnosis, solution, and resolution. While orientation is stable and causality holds, the plot lacks a decisive twist or meaningful complication; the solution (humming) is accessed immediately without trial and error, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line with a defined beginning, middle, and end. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where harmony is restored—feels earned more by magical mechanics than by a difficult interpersonal trade-off or significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a distinct objective and obstacle. The flashback to the glue analysis occupies a significant portion of the text for a backstory explanation, but the climax utilizes the established setting mechanics (thermal expansion) effectively for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure, moving from isolation to shared hope. The inciting incident (the woman's arrival) flows logically into the climax, though the "receipts" prop is discarded somewhat abruptly once its identification function is served.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is crisp and structurally sound, moving from observation to analysis to a decisive closure. The ending—a physical step back driven by a conceptual realization—is a strong example of Conceptual Repricing (CR) that lands with legible cost. The causal link between analyzing wood grain and finding the logbook relies on a slight "dream logic" leap, but it fits the established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative arc effectively builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration with the release of the feather. However, the progression is linear and low-resistance, relying on a standard "nature epiphany" beat without significant causal complication.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain breaks at the climax; the pivot to "hope" is a leap of intuition that feels convenient rather than inevitable. Closure lands (Conceptual Repricing), but the lack of an on-page cost for the knowledge makes the resolution feel tidy and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is intricate and the "ordering randomness" concept drives the structure effectively. However, the mechanism relies on extreme physical convenience (a soda can dislodging internal coins) that strains credibility, though the closure lands firmly on the intended effect.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative is a straight line from intention to execution to departure, lacking a significant turning point where the outcome is in doubt. While the closure (departure) works as a Decisive Change, the lack of obstacles or complications makes the plot feel like a summary of a ritual rather than a dramatic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear arc to a legible Conceptual Repricing, but the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by significant struggle; the lack of a tangible cost or trade-off limits the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure (releasing the ashes). However, the pivot relies on a low-pressure realization ("realizing they were siblings") that feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (problem identified -> tool applied -> problem fixed) that lacks a meaningful turn or complication. The closure is a classic "Symmetric Satisfaction" where the solution works perfectly with no "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" paid by the protagonist, resulting in a low-stakes "fix-it" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing, but the plot relies on a significant causality break: paper diaries surviving decades of "rain and rot" in a roofless room is implausible, even with the "miraculously preserved" patch. The pivot from the unique sonic premise to generic diary-reading weakens the narrative promise.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is a linear vignette where magic resolves the central problem without complication. Closure creates a clear before/after, but it lands as an unearned gift without the required felt or conceptual cost to ground the change.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path to closure, but the resolution feels mechanical. The central conflict is resolved by a "magic trick" (asking for names) that instantly dissolves centuries of hatred; the lack of causal friction makes the ending feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality is clean and the arc is legible; the release of the egg serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration that confirms the character's internal paradox. The closure is earned, with the approaching storm providing a natural, non-forced timeline for the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear inciting incident and closure (Decisive Change). A significant causal weakness exists in the rising action: the guards allowing her to pass solely due to "mesmerizing distraction" undermines the competence of the dystopian regime and lowers tension. The climax works well mechanically, but the setup relies on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative operates as a didactic vignette rather than a dramatic story, with the "half-lit epiphanies" of the crowd asserted via summary rather than earned through dramatized action. Closure lands as a tidy conceptual victory for Silas with no visible or felt cost; he executes a plan perfectly without risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure holds together well, building a coherent ritual that lands on a legible Conceptual Repricing (the migration ending in silence). The closure is distinct and earned by the setup, though the coincidence of the monarch landing precisely beside the moth wing feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (prep, melt, pour, finish) without a meaningful tightening or reversal to challenge the outcome. While the causality of the magic system is legible, the lack of an obstacle or complication results in a flat trajectory where success feels inevitable from the start. Closure is a "mission accomplished" moment rather than a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure is decisive and reconfigures the stakes with a clear cost (safety for chaos). The middle beat, however, relies on the dream sequence to conveniently deliver the location of the key object, bypassing potential agency or deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, leading to a resonant closure (blowing out the candle) that fits the character's logic perfectly. The scene lacks a localized complication or "micro-turn" within the ritual itself; the process proceeds without a hitch, which flattens the immediate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a "magic key" resolution where a specific tool solves the central conflict without generating significant narrative friction. The "reappearing" attribute of the cylinder removes the cost of the antagonist's resistance, flattening the causal chain. Closure is achieved through a conceptual realization, but it reads as an unearned shortcut rather than a decisive change paid for in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a linear process arc: preparation, ritual, success. While the closure creates a resonant final image (Conceptual Repricing), the lack of on-page complications or a moment where the plan nearly fails lowers the tension. The outcome feels inevitable due to high competence, missing a palpable "pivot" point where the cost is actively paid.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean causal arc with a distinct escalation when the standard tools fail. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration; the "deciduous" realization justifies the unorthodox solution, and the cost (the daughter's ribbon) is felt and thematic. The reliance on random bag contents is a bit situational but effectively pivoted into a character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from sensory retreat to confrontation and realization. The shift from a physical question ("Who is she?") to a meta-fictional realization ("turning pages") is abrupt but successfully recontextualizes the setting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, resolving the impossible task by altering the artistic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight and effective, with the botanical diary setup paying off precisely at the climax through a logic consistent with the story's rules. The closure is distinct and resonant, offering a clear reconfiguration of the status quo, though the "cost" required for the highest bands is borne chiefly by the secondary character rather than the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and arrives at a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression lacks causal friction; obstacles like the destabilizing time are overcome instantly via the "narrative thread" mechanic. The pacing is steady, but the ease of navigation reduces the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a frictionless linear path: enter, identify problem, apply tool, exit. The closure acts as a "soft reset," resolving high stakes without a legible felt or conceptual cost to the protagonist. The lack of obstacles or complications turns the plot into a procedural description rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible and the orientation is solid. The resolution, however, relies on a single successful action that instantly dissolves the threat, lacking the complications or "try-fail" cycles that create deeper narrative satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is linear and procedural, relying heavily on the off-page inciting incident (finding the prism) to resolve the conflict. Resistance is minimal; the protagonist faces mechanical obstacles (rust, gears) rather than causal complications, resulting in a low-tension sequence where success feels inevitable from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and compact, following a clear cause-and-effect chain from the storm to the measurement to the record. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the shadow's movement forces a crystallization of the era's identity with a felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (preparation leading to display) with legible closure but minimal cost. The discovery of the mosaic feels slightly convenient, and the resolution comes without a significant complication or sacrifice to weight the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story follows a clear, effective arc within the "pause" constraint, successfully utilizing an Accumulative lens. Closure is legible (Resonant Reconfiguration via acceptance), though the linear progression from tension to release lacks a distinct complication or reversal to heighten the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: wait, harvest, return. While the orientation is clear and the arc completes, the closure is a standard "mission accomplished" beat without a meaningful reconfiguration of stakes or a high-cost trade-off. The climax proceeds exactly as planned without forcing a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure (threat → action → resolution), but relies on a "magic feather" solution. The storm glass vial functions as a deus ex machina that resolves the central tension (shattering floor) effortlessly, creating a "soft reset" without complicating the plot or demanding ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot follows a linear fetch-quest structure (obstacle → use key → proceed) lacking causal complexity or unexpected turns. Closure is achieved through a summary statement of success ("claimed the seat") rather than a dramatized resolution of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is functional and achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (dropping the anchor), but the progression is linear and relies on an external catalyst (Elian) to resolve the static situation. The "cost" of letting go is mitigated immediately by the feeling of liberation, reducing the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, with the "concepts become physical" logic providing a sturdy framework for the climax. The use of the bolt as a focal point creates a satisfying, decisive closure that resolves the plot and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line with excellent orientation and a defined mechanism for rising action. Closure is definitive, executing a Decisive Change (breaking the lie), though the lock&#039;s design specifically to &quot;baffle the rational mind&quot; is a slight convenience to accommodate the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ritualistic logic is established early and pays off cleanly; the "puppet play as physics" concept anchors the causal chain effectively. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the environment reacting logically to the protagonist's actions under the established magical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear causal chain: dust patterns trigger the investigation, leading to the discovery and the final administrative action. The closure lands a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration, altering the file's meaning with a legible action (writing the addendum) that satisfies the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the resolution—a single keyturn correcting all societal history—feels mechanically convenient and lacks a commensurate cost. The "puddle map" logic strains plausibility as a navigational tool, functioning more as a magical plot device than grounded tradecraft.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal arc from the threat's activation to its containment. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, and closure is achieved with a legible "Decisive Change" (the machine stops). However, the reliance on expository blocks to explain the stakes and mechanics ("This was the threat," "This technique relied on") interrupts the dramatic momentum, making the resolution feel slightly procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear success procedural that lacks a "Decisive Change" with felt cost. While the causality is clear (hush → reading → building → result), the outcome is guaranteed and the "price" paid is purely material (a seed and a speck) rather than emotional or conceptual, resulting in a low-impact closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative drive is strong, with a clear causal chain leading to a decisive closure (stranded but transformed). The bridge failure provides excellent tangible pressure and forces a tactic shift, creating a robust "charged poise" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is a linear process (a ritual) that lacks causal friction or unexpected complications. While the closure (making the invisible visible) is resonant, the path to it is resistance-free, reading more like a vignette than a dramatic story.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line, but the lack of resistance makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. The closure is a "Decisive Change" for the ghost, but because Elian pays no price and faces no real obstacle (Plan A works perfectly), the ending lacks the necessary "felt cost" for the protagonist. It reads more like a procedural vignette than a dramatic story.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from disorientation to a decisive moment of conceptual repricing (removing the mask). The closure lands with clear cost (pain/radiation), though the causal logic of "solving the equation" via exposure relies on symbolic assertion rather than strict narrative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.7)
    The structure is a linear procedural ("inspect, diagnose, extract") that lacks a causal snap or reversal. Closure is a soft "task complete" beat (Earned Stasis) where the cost is described as a "heavy burden" but not dramatized through a change in capacity or option.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is tight and linear, with excellent orientation that grounds the reader immediately in the specific setting and premise. The causal chain—from dust analysis to the discovery of the mainspring—is logical and satisfying, leading to a clean Decisive Change closure where the environment is physically transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is coherent and the closure (Decisive Change) is undeniable, with a legible cost (Silas's death). However, the narrative arc is linear; Silas formulates a plan and executes it without facing complications, unexpected setbacks, or the need to adapt tactics, which creates an "outline-like" progression rather than a dynamic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from the storm's arrival to the ritualistic climax, with the "visible Time" mechanics providing a logical framework for the resolution. The closure lands a solid Conceptual Repricing, acknowledging the cost of the victory (fabrication vs. reality), though the shard functions slightly as a magic-key solution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story fails the closure cost requirement; the ending is a "magic fix" where the rust vanishes and the machine is fully restored without a visible trade-off or scar. The causality is largely symbolic—polishing clean gears causes a magical shockwave—which bypasses the mechanical logic established early on. It falls into the "Symmetric Satisfaction" anti-pattern where a massive problem is solved cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "success procedural" structure where the protagonist encounters no genuine setbacks; he arrives, performs a ritual, and succeeds. The ending fails the rubric's closure requirement as it lacks a visible or felt cost—Silas gains his prize without paying a price, resulting in a low-stakes victory lap.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative traces a clear, linear path from distress signal to rescue, but the resolution relies on the convenient physics of a 19th-century slide perfectly guiding a modern ship. The plot lacks structural surprise or a moment where the plan genuinely threatens to fail, lowering the sense of difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a valid Conceptual Repricing closure (changing her art style). The drive lens (Accumulative/Conceptual) holds, and the apparatus provides a distinct mechanism for the climax. However, the "vanished botanist" functions as a convenient setup device that lacks resolution or deeper integration into the causality of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the causal chain (problem → obstacle → tactic → resolution) is logical under the Causal lens. Orientation is solid, anchoring the reader quickly in the zeppelin and lagoon. However, the resolution feels somewhat convenient; the barrier is overcome by a simple puzzle solution without a complicating twist or unforeseen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal lens where the protagonist’s deliberate cognitive exertion directly drives the climax. Closure is achieved through a potent "Charged Poise" as she raises the bottle, with the cost of her creation (mental exhaustion and the moral weight of suffering) clearly paid on the page. The mechanics of the "cognitive genesis" are established early and pay off cleanly in the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The arc is crisp, moving efficiently from the inciting silence to the technical crisis and final realization. The link between the horn stopping and the sudden compulsion to play this specific cylinder relies on a situational coincidence, but the Conceptual Repricing at the end is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative tracks a clean linear path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where the cost of "stealing time" is realized. The causality of the magic system is functional, though the lack of structural complications makes the resolution feel slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a Decisive Change at the climax (killing the switch). The closure is legible, but the resolution relies on a planned deception ("claiming a sensor calibration error") which softens the structural cost; the consequence is administrative rather than a deeply felt personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a coherent, linear vignette that achieves a form of Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression is low-stakes. The ending offers a "symmetric satisfaction" where the ritual works exactly as intended, lacking a twist or deepening that would create narrative friction. The closure is legible but feels safe and predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a coherent Situational/Textural drive, culminating in an effective moment of Earned Stasis. The ritual logic—using the box to enforce silence—is established and executed cleanly. The closure lands with a felt conceptual cost (isolation as purity) that fits the established "tangled covenant."

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality holds from the garage sale code to the silo descent. However, the progression is compressed; the leap from the whimsical message listing to the profound philosophical resolution happens rapidly. Closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing (death as the constant), though it relies heavily on the narrator explaining the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causality is clean, following a clear inciting incident to a decisive closure where the flaw is reconfigured into art. The narrative arc is linear but structurally sound, with the "Conceptual Repricing" of the kite string landing effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Weeks bled into months") to resolve the central conflict, deflating the tension established in the opening scene. While the closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, the path to it bypasses dramatized struggle in favor of a montage, weakening the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative traces a clear causal arc from the ascent to the confrontation and final rejection. Finding Aris at the summit is a convenient coincidence that accelerates the plot but feels slightly unearned by the investigation mechanics. However, the closure—throwing the amber—is a decisive, resonant action that visibly reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the setting. The ending successfully synthesizes the story's logic into a tangible cost (loss of the grounding object).

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural track (arrive, listen, plant, leave) without deviation, causal friction, or unexpected variables. While the closure is legible (the garden grows), it feels mathematically inevitable rather than earned, as the protagonist faces no risk of failure or significant obstacle to the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is clean, but the resolution relies heavily on a "puzzle-box" contrivance—the leaf vein aligning perfectly with the phonograph groove is a coincidence that strains causality. While the closure provides a decisive change in knowledge, the "cost" is abstract (loss of isolation) rather than viscerally felt on the page. The puzzle logic supersedes organic narrative development.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The turning point—a coincidental "glimpse" of alignment—is a deus ex machina that resolves the central tension externally before the protagonist processes it internally, slightly weakening the earned nature of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a distinct Decisive Change at closure. However, the causality is somewhat mechanical—arrive, check tool, swap pieces, win—lacking unexpected obstacles or deepening complications. The "needle-thin peak" supporting a "monumental" chessboard creates a slight spatial logic issue, though the magical realism context softens this.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, held under a consistent Situational/Atmospheric lens. The causality of the acoustic climax—using the kings to snap the feedback loop—follows the established logic of the whispering gallery perfectly. Closure is resonant, delivering a tangible "before and after" state (noise/darkness to silence/light) with the revealed dust-text as a lasting artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on coincidence: the specific phoenix feather needed to decipher the stone is conveniently found nearby in an atlas, reducing the causal difficulty. However, the closure is clean and decisive, with the planting of the stone serving as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.4)
    The location of the "Tapestry of Origins"—a fundamental artifact of reality—inside a remote village archive is a significant convenience that undermines plausibility. While the closure (Decisive Change) is legible, the solution relies on this fortuitous prop placement rather than an organic development of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a distinct fable-like logic that governs the climax. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, shifting the village's reality from singular judgment to complex truth. However, the mechanism of the spire "reacting to unauthorized beauty" leans heavily on abstraction rather than established causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with significant cost (her life). The introduction of her specific magical ability ("attribute unique to her lineage") feels slightly convenient as a mid-story explanation, but the causal chain of the ritual itself is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on serendipity; the "wrong turn" (a required element) functions as a convenient shortcut to a "perfect" sanctuary rather than a complication that forces a difficult choice. This coincidence solves the logistical problem of the scene, reducing the protagonist's agency in earning the climax. The closure is legible, but the path there feels smoothed by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a convenient magical solution (the vial) that is immediately available and effective without complication. The lack of a "price" for using the heirloom artifact lowers the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a cohesive ritual structure that leads to a legible moment of Earned Stasis ("ghosts are home"). Orientation is stable, and the "hydraulics failed" backstory effectively sets the constraints for the scene's action. However, the progression is linear and procedural, lacking a decisive causal turn or complication that forces a shift in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a distinct problem to a specific solution and a verified result. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final lie acts as tangible proof of his changed state. The structure is somewhat linear, as the solution works immediately without complication ("the resistance did not come"), but the conceptual payoff is satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving from discovery to investigation to a resonant conceptual reconfiguration (CR). The causality of the "gap" method leading to the realization is tight and satisfying. The closure—repurposing the lighthouse—lands with clear conceptual weight, effectively recontextualizing the story's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is legible and the ending lands a distinct conceptual repricing of the quest. However, the middle section relies on a convenient contrivance—following ants against a flood due to a vague "magnetic pull"—to resolve the pathfinding problem; this acts as a lucky break rather than a derived causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear drive with a coherent Causal lens: the dream motivates the climb, which leads to the sanctuary. However, the resolution—fireflies spontaneously forming a shield—reads as a convenient environmental feature rather than a result of the protagonist's direct agency, slightly softening the causal force of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tightly wound, with the alchemical process mirroring the emotional arc perfectly. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration: the preservation of the moment recontextualizes the loss of the friend, with the "hollow chest" serving as the paid cost. The inciting incident (the confession) arrives late but acts effectively as the climactic turn, locking the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative loop (cabin -> dream -> cabin) provides a clear structure, and the closure (writing on the scroll) is a legible conceptual repricing of the protagonist's state. However, the causality is loose; the transition from dream to waking is driven by the "jealousy burning out" (a convenient mana bar mechanic) rather than a forced narrative turn or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, following a classic problem-solution structure that resolves with a tangible mechanical and emotional fix. The closure is resonant, though the mechanical solution (jamming a clamp screw into a clock) relies slightly on "fable logic" where symbolic resonance outweighs mechanical probability.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a defined inciting incident (wrist locking) and decisive closure (shedding). While the "Core Concept" explanation in the opening slows the launch, the structure effectively utilizes the time pressure of the approaching storm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands with excellent precision; the "imperfect miracle" functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the limitation is accepted with felt cost. The external framing device of the orchard provides a tight, effective clock that snaps shut at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure (glitch → walk → block → dictionary → fix) that resolves mechanically. The resolution relies on a "magic word" mechanic where reading a definition instantly dissolves the antagonist, lacking a felt cost or a difficult trade-off for the protagonist. While the story achieves closure by restoring the status quo, the ease of the victory undermines the declared cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    A flawless causal arc where the inciting action (using the key) leads inevitably to the climax (the fracture) and the resolution (the escape). The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the silence from peaceful to threatening—lands with undeniable weight. The drive lens holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story follows a coherent arc from observation to a Decisive Change, but the mechanism of the climax (a laser pointer conveniently overriding magnetic seals) lacks causal weight. The closure lands on a "perfect" integration, bypassing the professional or physical cost of such a breach in a high-security facility. This lack of friction or consequence softens the "revolution" into a wish-fulfillment vignette rather than a narrative with earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "tour" structure where the protagonist observes rather than acts against resistance. While the transition and closure are logically coherent under a causal lens, the lack of obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is efficient and structurally sound, using the "emotional loop" as a concrete pressure point that necessitates the climax; the closure is decisive and earned via the specific mechanical intervention of the glass disc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative is coherent and the closure (the successful anchoring of the laugh and the sacrifice of the locket) lands with thematic resonance. The structure is strictly linear and procedural, lacking a "micro turn" or complication that would test the protagonist's resolve or alter the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fable-like structure works efficiently, moving from setup to transaction to closure. The middle section (rumor chain) is summary rather than scene, reducing tension, but the final action (throwing the rock) provides a legible Conceptual Repricing of the deal.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a competent linear fetch quest—enter forest, touch trees, find center—that lacks a decisive turning point or reversal. The ending provides closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) but feels unearned because the solution (finding peace) is granted by the environment rather than forged through a difficult trade-off or agency.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: assess problem, repair tool, execute fix. While the mechanics of causality are explained, the arc lacks a turning point generated by struggle; success is immediate and guaranteed by the premise. The closure ("satisfied," "readable") lands as a soft reset rather than a resolution earned through on-page cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure is linear and procedural (setup, observation, shutter click) with no causal complications or reversals. Closure relies on an asserted conceptual shift; the "cost" of erasure is a backstory premise, not a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the progression relies on convenient leaps in logic (her mind "instantly calculated" the trajectory) that bypass potential friction or obstacles, reducing the earned weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is strong, with the protagonist’s actions directly forcing the climax and resolution. The mechanism of "finger tapping" overriding a complex bio-acoustic machine strains plausibility slightly—leaning more into magic than science—but the narrative logic remains consistent within the established rules. The closure is a definitive, high-cost departure from reality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a satisfying causal chain leading to the climax. The "folded map" shortcut and the magnetic latch mechanics provide a solid logic for the resolution. Closure is decisive, effectively trapping the antagonist and validating the protagonist's strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of "problem presented, problem solved" without causal complication or cost. The resolution—a profound psychological shift triggered merely by watching light beams—feels unearned and convenient ("magical healing"). The closure creates a reconfiguration of the woman's state, but the lack of prior resistance makes the change feel asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the city freezing) is a strong Conceptual Repricing. However, the mechanism shifts conveniently from Elias "hearing" thoughts to him telepathically "projecting" the signal, a capability expansion that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a decisive biological transformation as closure. The resolution relies heavily on the sudden introduction of the whale song and the scrimshaw's convenient magic, which feels like a *deus ex machina* rather than a causal inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structural arc is flawless for this length, moving efficiently from the establishing pressure of the turbines to the proxy action (whittling wood) and escalating to the irreversible destruction of the bouquet. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "remade hush" is achieved at the explicit cost of the protagonist's connection to his past.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear Causal path from entry to successful ritual completion, with legibly anchored orientation. However, the closure—a realization that "separation had never been real"—reads as a "soft reset" victory where the stated danger ("lethal voltage") is bypassed by competence without a tangible on-page cost or trade-off. The ending offers a neat "Concept Repricing" but lacks the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc from the bargain to the sacrifice of the reed, ending with a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "messy" outcome is accepted. The closure feels earned and perfectly aligns with the established logic of the fable.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear problem-solution arc, but the resolution relies on a pseudo-scientific leap—converting light to physical mass via a simple glass lens—that lacks sufficient grounding in the story's established logic. The "Eureka" moment feels convenient and lowers the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and the ritual closure lands effectively with a clear transformation, but the trajectory is linear and devoid of complications, reading more like a successful procedure than a dramatic struggle. The pacing is smooth, though the lack of obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is tight; the physical act of measuring directly triggers the realization and the subsequent breach of protocol. The closure lands a strong Conceptual Repricing (the market as an engineered demolition) rooted in the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal; the "anti-pattern" dance provides a logical, satisfying mechanism for overcoming the antagonist (the archive). The closure is definitive and earned, though the revelation itself (the "true history") is treated as a generic summary rather than a specific, dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot executes a clean Causal arc with a legible inciting incident (the video discrepancy) leading directly to a decisive climax (trapping the shadow). The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the stone is hidden and the cost is accepted—lands with clear weight, satisfying the high-band criteria for structure and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident, action, and resolution within a single scene. The backstory integration is efficient, providing necessary context without halting momentum. Closure is achieved through the completed surgery and the protagonist's shift in perspective, though the link between the two is explicitly stated.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to excavation to a resonant closure (the lullaby) that reconfigures the stakes. The pivot mechanism—using a coffee ring as a topographic map—relies on unearned magical convenience that strains causality, even within the story's fantastical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well, moving from the physical strip to the metaphysical release. Closure lands firmly with a Conceptual Repricing (the lens as amber), though the lack of severe obstacles keeps the narrative arc somewhat flat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and provides closure via a Resonant Reconfiguration (surrender leads to success), but the resolution feels convenient. The shift from "crushing" pressure to "cool river" flow happens instantaneously upon resting, creating a "soft reset" that bypasses the friction of a true dilemma or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational arc—a maintenance ritual that restores stasis. The pacing is steady, and the closure ("Everything is safe") effectively lands an Earned Stasis. However, the plot is strictly linear; Kaelen faces no unexpected obstacles or tactical shifts, making the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the protagonist overcomes obstacles immediately with no setbacks. The resolution offers symmetric satisfaction—fixing the machine fixes the man—but lacks the requisite "felt cost" or complication to make the closure resonate as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, but the protagonist is largely passive, led by the guide to a realization delivered via exposition rather than earned struggle. The closure relies on a literalized metaphor ("pulling the weight") that, while providing a clear ending, feels mechanically assisted rather than driven by the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc: climb, discovery, realization, and decision. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the choice to "remain" as a contaminant rather than flee recontextualizes his presence in the fortress. The pivotal discovery relies slightly on a lucky glance ("slightest discoloration"), but the resulting internal shift is rigorously motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is sturdy, with the trap and trigger mechanics clearly established and paid off. Closure is decisive and follows the established logic of the story's magic system. The narrative arc is linear and functional, though it lacks a moment of doubt or deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Investigative lens, moving effectively from mystery to data assembly to revelation. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: the "void" is recontextualized not as emptiness, but as a consuming, adaptive life force. The causality holds narratively, though the "knuckle-tapping" mechanics strain suspension of disbelief regarding how they generate seismic data.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—setup, execution, success—lacking a decisive turning point or complication. The closure is "symmetric satisfaction," resolving the goal exactly as intended without a felt or conceptual cost, failing the closure requirement for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene is coherent and linear, achieving a clear Decisive Change at closure. However, the central plot device—scientists hiding binary world-saving codes on a kite, which Elara happens to have found—strains credibility, reading as a convenient puzzle solution rather than organic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing an external trigger (turbine whine) to seamlessly launch the internal conflict. Closure is excellent; the grafting act serves as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that physically manifests the internal resolution (hope anchored in rough reality). The transition from the flashback back to the greenhouse is managed with clear causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving logically from the inciting pressure (walls closing) to a resourceful attempt at salvation (untangling threads) and finally to a resonant closure (dropping into the void). The ending successfully reconfigures the stakes, framing the descent into darkness not as defeat but as an artistic necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is tight and linear, with the prompt elements driving the structure naturally. The closure is strong: a Decisive Change in target (man to pattern) and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's understanding. The "ink as portal" twist lands effectively within the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight, utilizing a single scene to dismantle a world order with clear causality. The arrival of Kael provides necessary immediate pressure, and the closure is a decisive, irreversible change that effectively pays off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the antagonist is pacified by the protagonist's aura and "spores of calm," undermining causal logic. The ending lacks earned consequences, as the threat evaporates instantly upon the protagonist's moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal arc from preparation to the successful hunt, with the "descent of stars" providing a strong inciting pressure. Closure is decisive and thematically resonant (commodification of the divine), though the specific capturing technique ("voicing silence") appears late without specific foreshadowing, feeling slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path, but the resolution relies on a weak antagonist who collapses immediately upon hearing a counter-argument. The "proof" is probabilistic rather than absolute, and the journalist’s instant capitulation creates a low-resistance ending that lacks earned tension or closure weight.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal arc is clear, moving efficiently from the inciting boot sequence to the resonant closure of the trapped sound. However, the mid-scene exposition regarding "time folding" and the letters slightly drags momentum during the rising action, explaining the stakes rather than letting them manifest solely through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causal, with a clear inciting incident and resolution. The "magic system" logic of the resolution (severing the knot silences ghosts) is convenient but established within the story's reality. The cost—destroying his art—is legible on the page, satisfying closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.3)
    The closure is excellent, utilizing a "Conceptual Repricing" where the protagonist redefines the child as art to bypass the system. This solution is inextricably linked to the character's unique perception and the established setting, satisfying the 9+ standard for closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" structure where the protagonist identifies a problem and resolves it using magical abilities that face no significant resistance. The closure—Clara's change of heart—relies on a convenient magical alteration of the coin and atmosphere ("God Mode" resolution) rather than a causal chain of hard choices or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    The arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the "screeching feedback" problem to a somatic solution. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "fractally precise" image does not cure the noise but reconfigures it into an enduring, manageable beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, moving from patrol to encounter to realization. The closure acts as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (guardian to interpreter). However, the cost is low; the fossil resolves the "crushing isolation" threat too efficiently, reducing the sense of risk in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is clear and leads to a legible Decisive Change (breaking the prophecy). However, the progression is linear and lacks resistance; the solution works immediately without a setback or complication that tests the protagonist's resolve. The inciting incident ("truth unravels") remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scene structure is solid, with clear orientation and a complete causal arc from signal to extraction. The closure—a Decisive Change secured by the pillbox reveal—lands effectively, though the logic of stomping codes in fog for a drone relies on convenient "plausible deniability" physics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (diagnosis, treatment, departure) with no causal complications, resulting in a "soft reset" closure that lacks felt cost. The timer ("rain gutters") is mentioned but does not exert causal pressure on the pacing or force a trade-off in the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is a linear vignette that lacks causal propulsion or a decisive turning point where options narrow. While the "Conceptual Repricing" ending (resistance as devotion) provides intellectual closure, it feels like a "gift" from the setting rather than a hard-won reconfiguration of the protagonist's world.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain; the death of the rose logically permits the mechanical intervention. Closure is effective and resonant, creating a clear before/after state with the connection established.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.0)
    The resolution is driven by a magical object (the obsidian disc) that "forces" the protagonist to see the truth, stripping her of agency in the pivotal moment. The narrative follows a linear path (waking to healing) without a decisive turn or complication that challenges her intent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on a "magic key" resolution where a twig naturally fits a futuristic metal sculpture and activates it, which breaks causal plausibility (Causal Lens). The connection between the client's silence and the art installation is symbolic rather than structural, leading to a "soft reset" ending that resolves the tension without logical groundwork or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    The plot follows a strictly linear trajectory (identify threat → apply technical fix → success) without a "try-fail" cycle or meaningful complication. The resolution relies on a convenient, late-introduced justification (the station sitting on a "ley line") and a "magic wand" technological fix that works instantly. The closure brings the situation to a halt but lacks a felt cost or a reconfiguration of the protagonist's status beyond simple relief.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear causal arc with immediate stakes and a legible decisive change at closure. The inciting action (playing) directly triggers the antagonist force (walls), creating a tight problem-solution loop that resolves clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal drive is clean, using the physical creation of the art to force the resolution. The "lance" moment serves as a sharp, tactile turning point that effectively anchors the climax, though the resolution relies on a somewhat compressed reaction from the detective.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    A linear "lock-and-key" sequence where Elara follows instructions without deviation or unexpected obstacles. The closure is a successful mechanical operation rather than a hard-won narrative turn with visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is coherent, with a clear trajectory from the inciting anomaly to a Conceptual Repricing closure (the bridge is "buffering," not broken). The logic is surreal but consistent within the established frame, though the causal link between the wind's binary code and the resolution feels convenient rather than earned by hard tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary to handle the "collapse" phase, draining tension from the narrative arc and violating the show-don't-tell preference for key developments. While the inciting incident is dramatized, the climax is rushed and the falling action is compressed into exposition, weakening the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist resolves the central conflict via a convenient, asserted ability ("heals with words") rather than earned tactics. The closure is tidy and lacks the required visible, felt, or conceptual cost to give the victory weight, resulting in a low-stakes resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive: entry, obstacle, resolution (Decisive Change). The closure is legible—the confession is released—but the resolution relies on a pre-possessed tool (the seed) that functions as a skeleton key, bypassing significant struggle. The absence of a "felt cost" or forced trade-off keeps this in the functional band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is functional and linear, moving cleanly from arrival to acquisition of knowledge with a legible Decisive Change. However, the progression lacks significant resistance; the psychic maze is navigated in a single paragraph without a moment of genuine doubt or tactical reversal. Closure is achieved, but the victory feels somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands with exceptional clarity: the Resonant Reconfiguration of Elian’s internal state (from confident idealist to empty vessel) is a tangible cost for the success. The causal drive is tight, and the mechanics of the trade feel earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive lens with a legible inciting incident and climax (breaking the frame). Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (stewardship over profit), though the external obstacle (Kellen) offers minimal resistance, making the victory feel slightly low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the inciting drift to the specific counter-action of planting the seed. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the relationship between Elian and Aris from absence to a new form of presence. The pacing handles the transition from exposition to action smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative is a clean, linear procedural vignette that lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with the singing ingot. The structure is solid, but the "turn" relies on low-stakes competence without a moment of doubt or trade-off to heighten the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on a magical object and a sudden epiphany to resolve the central conflict, bypassing genuine struggle or causal logic. The closure ("dissolve the walls") feels unearned because the cost of violating his orders is not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path from the inciting perception (graffiti) to the act of closure (accordion). The causality relies heavily on the convenience of the graffiti numbers matching a specific river coordinate, which works under the lens of mania but strains narrative credibility as a "prophecy" fulfilled. Closure is effectively internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible Decisive Change at the closure (securing the words). The mechanics of the library (cipher, reversal) provide effective causal obstacles, though the escape feels slightly rushed ("burst through") and the resolution relies on a told success rather than a final complicating trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight causal arc where the protagonist's specific skills (provenance, divination) directly enable the resolution. The closure is a decisive, irreversible transformation of the central object that satisfies the setup with a distinct "before" and "after." The magical logic of the "hole in destiny" is established and paid off efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a strictly linear procedural arc (task presented > process described > task completed) without meaningful complication or reversal. While the orientation and causality are clear, the closure is a "success state" that restores the status quo rather than a reconfiguration with a felt cost. The lack of distinct obstacles makes the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is functional and complete, effectively linking the physical task to the internal resolution. However, the pacing sags during the tree-climbing reflection, and the causality is soft; the solution arises from a convenient memory rather than escalated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is efficient with a clear Decisive Change at the end. Orientation is solid, though the resolution pivots on "magical" objects (mirror, cloak) that short-circuit a more complex causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, with Kael reframing his understanding of power. However, the "magnetic grotto" and its "theta waves" act as a convenient plot device that forces the epiphany, reducing the protagonist's agency in earning the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain (read birds → throw → ride sound → exit) that fulfills the prompt's process logic. While technically sound, the lack of a complication or "try/fail" cycle makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won, though the intersection with the past scream provides a satisfying conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid with a clear drive lens (Causal), moving from ascent to the decisive action of placing the stone. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration, with the city below altered. The reliance on the location's attribute ("accommodates impossibilities") to resolve the physical constraints of the arch feels like a late-breaking convenience rather than a setup paid off with ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, but the progression is linear with minimal friction. The retrieval process lacks complications—he lands softly and the lock opens easily—which lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing an Accumulative lens that builds pressure through the static to a moment of Earned Stasis. The closure works well, anchoring the abstract stakes in a concrete decision to persist, though the transition into the final doubt feels slightly rushed in its pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is solid and the "Situational" drive lens is clear. However, the narrative is a linear procedure (setup -> magic -> completion) without a distinct pivot or causal branch; the outcome feels predetermined by the initial setup rather than earned through emergent struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear repair arc with a "magic fix" closure; the foreshadowed cost ("swing back with crushing force") remains a theoretical narrator warning rather than a dramatized consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: Elias forms a plan and executes it without unforeseen obstacles or cost. While the orientation and causality are clear, the "Slick Success" arc lacks the friction or significant "felt cost" required for higher bands; the climax is a foregone conclusion from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a legible inciting incident (sunset) and climax (the spell), achieving closure. However, the resolution feels convenient; the transition from struggle to success is bridged by a sudden epiphany that dissolves the central obstacle without significant narrative complication.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is taut and functionally perfect for this length, moving from a sensory opening to a high-stakes problem and a resolved closure. The causality is strict: the discovery of the fracture forces the improvised repair, which directly enables the survival. The ending effectively reconfigures the opening silence from a threat into a lingering weight.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on a deus ex machina resolution where the antagonist is "erased by a timeline" simply because Kael verbally challenged his authority. This dissolves the central conflict through a convenient external shift rather than a causal victory derived from the protagonist's actions or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.6)
    Causality relies on significant convenience; the seed blooms in hours to fit the narrative window without establishing a magical reality, breaking suspension of disbelief. The closure is a neat conceptual bow that lacks a paid cost or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear escalation of acoustic pressure leading to a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (the return of laughter). The closure lands effectively with emotional weight, though the "magical" mechanism is somewhat convenient, it fits the established surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational drive, effectively using the "interiorizing exteriors" mechanic to blur the line between setting and conflict. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, earning the stasis at the end through the protagonist’s decision to endure the "crushing geometry" for a moment of connection. The plot mechanics are sound, though the lack of an active threat from the intruder lowers the causal stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a valid Decisive Change at the closure. However, the pivot relies on a sudden epiphany ("penny drops") and a convenient reagent ("solvent... from forbidden texts") rather than a solution strictly derived from the constraints established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is legible and the closure (stabilizing the signal) lands clearly under a Situational lens. The narrative relies on a linear problem-solution structure where the turning point—switching listening modes—happens with minimal on-page friction or trial-and-error, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    The resolution relies on a "deus ex machina" logic (sound waves turning into sand) that is not established early, breaking causal continuity. The ending is purely restorative without the required "visible, felt, or conceptual cost," failing the closure gate for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and relentless; the act of stabilizing the illusion directly precipitates the climax where the logic traps him. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (or Conceptual Repricing) where the physical rupture forces a new, painful understanding of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a tactile grounding to a cosmic expansion and back, creating a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The "risk of madness" is mentioned as a stake but never manifests or creates pressure in the scene, which slightly softens the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a distinct investigation-confrontation structure. However, the resolution relies on a magic system rule ("A heart that is remembered cannot be devoured") introduced at the climax to solve the problem, which weakens the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, effectively utilizing the ticking clock of the tidal changes to drive momentum. The closure is complete but safe; the "Return" succeeds without a significant, lasting cost to Elias beyond immediate physical peril. The ending feels slightly too tidy, resolving the tension without an enduring conceptual or emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is complete and the "techno-shamanism" logic is established early, serving the story's reality. However, the resolution feels convenient; the ink ritual functions as a "solve-all" button that delivers a perfectly coherent verbal explanation from the wife, smoothing over the struggle too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from setup to execution to consequence. Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the canyon's acoustics comes with a definitive, on-page cost (the loss of voice) that validates the curse mythology introduced earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a clear Decisive Change (the cure). The inciting incident (finding the arrowhead) feels convenient, and the ritual proceeds linearly to success without a significant complication or reversal to test Elias's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is sturdy: method leads to result, which leads to a decisive change (closure). The structure is linear but effective, landing a clear "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the city. However, the orientation is slightly front-loaded with exposition, and the transition from music to destruction happens without a "micro turn" or complication to ratchet tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, with the "linking absences" technique providing a clever, established mechanic for the border crossing. The closure is decisive and logically earned, though the resolution feels slightly smooth; the cost of the crossing is physical exertion rather than a painful trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the inciting bell to the resolution, with the "wrong turn" serving as a functional, if slightly convenient, pivot to the oasis. The closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's nature is altered to achieve the goal, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Situational/Causal" lens holds, with the experiment providing clear escalation. The closure is legible—the breach fails, and she returns to duty—but the resolution mechanism (the prop breaking due to tension) is a physics-based deus ex machina that spares Elara a difficult choice. This passivity at the pivotal moment caps the score despite strong setup.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is a straight line of task completion: problem, magical process, perfect success, relief. While the orientation and pacing are functional, the story lacks a meaningful turning point or deepening; the "cipher" is solved too cleanly. The closure is tidy and devoid of the visible or felt cost required for high-band literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-ritual-solution structure that functions clearly but relies on a "magical fix" where the climax (looking at the star) instantly resolves decades of trauma. The appearance of the star acts as a convenient trigger rather than a complication, making the closure feel unearned by character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a convenient coincidence ("today marked the timeframe") to resolve the plot, rendering the protagonist passive until the climax. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the goal is achieved without an on-page cost or complication, lowering narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: diagnosis via tea leaves leads directly to the intervention with the stylus, culminating in a decisive change with visible cost (the shattered prism). The explanation of "reversible exile" is efficient, though slightly expository, but the mechanism of weakening the glass to allow self-liberation is a satisfying structural turn. The closure is distinct and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural that lacks a causal turn or obstacle; the protagonist intends to graft the seed, and he simply does so without complication. The closure relies on a "job done" beat where success is absolute and immediate, lacking a felt cost or a moment of doubt that would earn the resolution. The "hush of budding hope" serves as a convenient window rather than a pressure mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight causal process (ritual unraveling) that physically manifests the deepening stakes. The pivot—revealing the spirit is his brother—recontextualizes the ritual without breaking momentum. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the task succeeds, but the protagonist's status shifts from healer to prisoner.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive with a satisfying puzzle resolution via forensic observation. However, the mechanism's specific requirement ("tuned to human emotion") appears late as a convenient rule to enable the solution, slightly undercutting the earned nature of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is clean and linear, establishing the "psychic wreckage" premise early and paying it off with the snow globe's release. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, though the resolution—simply touching the glass to break the loop—feels mechanically convenient and lacks a surprising causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear process—plan, prep, execute, succeed—without a meaningful reversal or complication to test the protagonist. While the closure works mechanically (the lights calm), the cost is minimal (getting wet, "residual heat") and the outcome feels inevitable rather than earned against odds. The "impossible timeframe" suggests tension, but Elian succeeds instantly without a stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without meaningful obstacles; the puzzle solves itself through convenient environmental alignment (sunlight at the 5th floor) rather than character ingenuity under stress. Closure is achieved through information acquisition, but because there is no sacrifice or risk involved, the "secret" feels like a low-value reward.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and relies on a coincidental manifestation of the exact proof Elian seeks. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of his role as librarian—lands, but the climax happens *to* him rather than being earned by a specific tactical variation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative relies on the sudden discovery of the book safe and coin to resolve the central conflict; this resource lacks prior setup, reading as a convenient plot device rather than an integrated part of the scene's logic. Closure is strong and resonant, but the causal path to it feels lucky rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on unearned "intuition" to move the protagonist from the deck to the nursery, breaking causal linkage. The climax hinges on a convenient coincidence (a book’s dog-ear matching a floor drawing) rather than earned deduction. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" beat where success is total and costless, lacking the required closure friction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clear and logically sound, with the protagonist arriving prepared to solve the central problem. However, the resolution relies on a highly specific tool (the "essence of twilight") that she conveniently possesses, which lowers the narrative tension and makes the closure feel like a checklist completion rather than a hard-won victory with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a linear problem-solution path that relies on a "magic feather" resolution (a sprinkler frequency controlling a nebula) with no on-page cost. The closure fails the "felt cost" requirement, as the problem is solved perfectly by following instructions, resulting in a tidy, unearned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and procedural: Silas plans a task and executes it without complication, deviation, or orientation debt. While the closure is legible (the transmission succeeds), the narrative lacks a causal turn or obstacle that tests the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear Causal path, but the resolution relies on a "magic key" (the seed-processor) that instantly rewrites enemy protocols. This functions as a soft reset or "explain-everything" ending without a tactical trade-off or escalation that tests the protagonist's ingenuity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from observation to epiphany to resolution. However, the breakthrough arrives with "sudden, lucid clarity" upon observing the river, which feels like a low-resistance path to closure; the internal conflict is resolved intellectually rather than through a pressured choice that tests his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear procedure that functions as a setup, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing that recontextualizes Elian’s trade. The causality of the magic system is well-established, though the beat structure is linear and lacks a mid-scene reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure: arrival, diagnosis, extraction, and resolution. While the closure lands with a clear change in the setting's atmosphere, the progression feels inevitable and lacks a meaningful complication or reversal to heighten the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with clear causality but relies on a symmetric, low-cost resolution. The ending is tidy, fixing the crisis without a lingering price or structural shift in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal path from preparation to transformation without significant deviation or reversal. Closure is distinct—a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist into a "living library"—but the "dangerous process" cited in the text is overcome with convenient ease, lacking a complication that tests her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a defined objective and ticking clock, maintaining coherence throughout. However, the closure is a "clean win" (Task Complete) lacking the "felt or conceptual cost" required for higher bands; the world is saved without sacrifice or reconfiguration of the protagonist's state. The escape is resolved too smoothly to register as a decisive change, ending on a note of simple satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a causal lens, moving efficiently from the inciting omen to the analysis of failure and the final successful attempt. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration; the breaking of the silence is a decisive change with visible impact on the world and the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative structure is clean, moving efficiently from observation to epiphany to a decisive stance (Resonant Reconfiguration). The "decoding" beat relies on a slightly convenient intuitive leap, but the closure lands with clear conceptual cost (accepting permanent exile).

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path (attempt, adjustment, success), but the closure relies on "Symmetric Satisfaction" where the external world (fireworks) perfectly applauds the internal victory without cost. The ending feels tidy and low-stakes, lacking the "felt cost" required for higher bands; the resolution is a procedural success rather than a narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the climax relies on a coincidence—the bloom synchronizing perfectly with the "turning of the tide's thought." Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the convenient timing reduces the sense of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear linear path, but the resolution relies on a convenient epiphany where the protagonist instantly intuits the complex biological function of an ancient artifact. This "magic button" ending resolves the central conflict too easily, bypassing the need for a causal trial-and-error process or earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    The investigative arc is coherent and logically sequenced, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing of the crash as an inevitability. However, the progression is linear and low-resistance, lacking a decisive turn or obstacle that forces a shift in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative is a linear procedural that executes the prompt's instructions without causal complication or distinct turning points. The closure provides a "soft reset" where success is instantaneous and guaranteed, lacking the requisite decisive change or felt cost to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from setup to ritual to closure via Conceptual Repricing. The logic of the magic system holds, and the ending lands with clear retrospective cost, though the linear progression lacks significant complications to test the protagonist's plan.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal arc with a distinct beginning, process, and result. Closure is achieved through the failed equation and Kael's hollowing, offering a decisive negative change. The orientation is immediate, grounding the reader in the workshop and the Operator's intent quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a clear Causal drive, leading to a functional Decisive Change in the world state. However, the progression lacks complication or adaptation; the protagonist succeeds on the first attempt without significant setbacks or enforced tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causal, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's memory is recontextualized. The pacing is linear and efficient, though the lack of complications during the ritual makes the path to closure feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational line: the encroaching silence forces a specific preparation and a final, high-cost sacrifice. Closure is decisive and earned on the page (her life for the message), with the logic of the "puzzle raft" clearly established before it is used.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.0)
    The resolution relies on a Deus Ex Machina; the silk is produced from an apron without setup, solving the crisis instantly. The narrative is linear and lacks a causal chain of complications; Ewan descends and succeeds without his plan facing a "therefore" test or forcing a backup tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean Causal drive, moving from a deliberate ritual through resistance to a decisive revelation. Closure lands firmly as a Conceptual Repricing—the "betrayal" is recontextualized as "mercy" with a legible physical and emotional cost (blood and burden).

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.6)
    The story establishes a clear orientation and situational drive, but the closure relies on a soft reset where the terror "evaporates" instantly upon seeing the light. The resolution lacks a felt cost or complication, making the psychological shift feel convenient rather than earned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is a coherent situational vignette that successfully lands a "Conceptual Repricing" closure (the shadow cast over the city). However, the causality regarding the "accidental prophecy" is loose; the prophecy happens in parallel to the action rather than driving the beat or the outcome, slightly weakening the narrative spine.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from preparation to the climactic chemical reaction and subsequent realization. The closure functions well as a Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the donor's nature from magic to perspective. The pacing allows the tension of the "sun trails" to land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is frictionless and tidy; the "tear" in reality functions as a "soft reset" complication that is immediately resolved by the tool's secondary feature without cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal arc is robust, moving cleanly from creation to containment to release with a decisive closure. The "psychic resonance" beat, while functional, feels like a convenient magic-system patch rather than a strictly character-earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear test/reward structure where the protagonist passes the barrier with relative ease using his innate traits. The ending relies on an "explain-everything" monologue by the Librarian to resolve the central tension, reducing the sense of narrative discovery and earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is a coherent single scene that moves from the bleak exterior to the sanctuary, ending with a valid Earned Stasis closure. The pacing is steady, and the transition into the tea house works well to deepen the focus. The closure creates a legible "before/after" state of internal reconfiguration ("tenuous absolution"). It lacks a sharp external causal turn, but the ritualistic structure suits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is linear and functional, effectively dramatizing the preservation of the slide with clear causality. The closure lands well as a "Conceptual Repricing," where the emotional warmth of the vows is successfully traded for the cold safety of data, fitting the drive lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is tight and effective; the "truce of hush" constraint naturally drives the stalling tactics and leads directly to the climax. The closure is decisive and clearly earned, paying off the unique setup with a distinct "Decisive Change" event.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight and moves briskly from the navigation challenge to the conceptual discovery. The closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to the world is fundamentally altered with a visible physical manifestation (the cloud). The logic of the "biological vote" holds the narrative together well.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a constrained wait to a decisive ritual of liberation. The closure is structurally sound, utilizing the "painting with something behind it" to create a distinct final image. However, the progression relies heavily on internal monologue rather than external complication until the lock-breaking beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causality is tight, with the somatic trait driving the climax effectively and the closure landing with a decisive change in tactics. The "treasure map" backstory feels like a convenient, genre-clashing shortcut that thins the sophisticated tone, but the on-page scene work recovers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear Causal lens: preparation leads to execution, which leads to the sonic release. The closure acts as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the valley's silence. Causality is solid—the physics of the ice melting drives the plot—but the trajectory is predictable, lacking a pivot or complication that forces a new tactic mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally driven; the inciting incident (magnetic reversal) directly forces the climax (burning the fears). Closure is definitive (Decisive Change), with the cost of the protagonist's memories clearly paid on the page to enable his survival.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on fable logic (a mechanical lock opening to "sun angles" and "rhymes") that clashes with the realist demolition threat. The resolution hinges on a convenient legal *deus ex machina* (a holographic will in a locket) that dissolves the external threat instantly, bypassing earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a predictable straight line from arrival to execution to success, lacking significant setbacks or causal pivots. While the closure is legible (AI freed), the lack of a visible, felt cost on the page (beyond "breathing hard") weakens the impact of the Decisive Change. The "Hangman's Dice" rolling "open door" at the start further deflates tension by signaling the outcome early.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is taut, moving efficiently from a high-concept setup to a tactile crisis. The climax—using the flowers as a psychic anchor to counteract the gravity spike—relies on the established "psychic and physical planes" logic, ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of his relationship to the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of intention, action, and success without a meaningful reversal or complication. The "malevolent probability" is a passive threat that never forces a deviation in tactics, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scene is structurally taut, opening with an inciting prop (the seal) and escalating through dialogue to a paradigm-shifting realization. The closure is excellent; the acceptance of the seal represents a clear Conceptual Repricing where "learning" is redefined as "deceiving." The drive lens functions perfectly as a Situational setup resolving into a Causal commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from inciting intent to a Decisive Change with legible cost. Causality is unbroken, though the progression is linear and procedural, lacking a complicating reversal that would heighten the sense of difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is a linear procedural where convenient tools (the counter-resonance key, the enzyme-laden thorn) solve obstacles without forcing a trade-off or adaptation. Closure is achieved cleanly, but the lack of an unexpected complication or paid cost creates a "perfect crime" feel rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure where obstacles are overcome effortlessly by the protagonist's established skills, lacking a true moment of doubt or failure. The explicit labeling of the resolution mechanic as "progressive disclosure" reads as meta-commentary that disrupts the story's internal reality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and exposition ("She tracked the dead not through seances," "Elara knew that objects held..."), distancing the reader from the immediate scene. The plot moves linearly from problem to solution via data analysis without a distinct "all is lost" moment or a causal turn that forces a hard choice. The resolution is an intellectual reconstruction rather than a dramatic event, reducing the climax to an explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building from the tea ritual to the whistle climax with legible transitions. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the fireflies confirm his worldview, though the &quot;game of high stakes&quot; mentioned in the text feels asserted rather than causally demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative momentum stalls significantly when the protagonist spends "hours" reassembling letters mid-crisis, relying on summary that dilutes the scene's urgency. Additionally, the climax relies on a convenient coincidence (the machine failing exactly then) and an unearned aptitude (fixing complex physics by ear), which weakens the causal chain despite the solid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story operates primarily as a synopsis or iterative summary ("Night after night," "As the movement grew") rather than a singular, grounded scene. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is distinct and earned, the narrative mode distances the reader from the causal chain, presenting the climax as a reported event rather than an immediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain (diagnose box → mix sounds → repair). However, the closure relies on a hypothetical outcome ("he imagined the young scavengers... they would hear") rather than a dramatized interaction, softening the ending's impact. The resolution is too tidy; the experiment works perfectly on the first try with no complication or unforeseen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal drive lens (Problem: key stuck; Solution: vibrational matching), leading to a decisive change in the environment. The closure is legible and provides a resonant reconfiguration of the setting (noise to silence), though the resolution ("sins of the past neutralized") feels slightly too tidy and summarized rather than dramatized. Causality holds well throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure is linear and lacks complication; the plan executes exactly as intended without a twist, failure, or adaptation. While the closure (bridge destruction) is clear, the absence of a "visible or felt cost" or a causal reversal weakens the structural weight. The reliance on a "freak winter squall" as a setup convenience reduces causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal drive with excellent orientation; the investigation leads directly to the confrontation with Halloway. Closure is a strong Decisive Change where Elias defies a direct order, incurring a specific professional cost (ending his advancement) that is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting request to a resonant closure with felt cost (Conceptual Repricing). The "resonance engine" twist is a strong pivot that reframes the initial problem, though it relies on a convenient magical property.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain where observation leads to specific preparation (carving gears), culminating in a decisive launch triggered by the workshop's collapse. The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "punchline" of the bell recontextualizes the struggle. Orientation and pacing are handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure functions as a potent Conceptual Repricing; the shift from "deceased" to "archived assets" fundamentally alters the premise with legitimate horror. The causal chain from the number anomaly to the drone confrontation and final discovery is tight and flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story relies on a "magic bullet" resolution where a metaphysical fetch-quest instantly resolves a complex geopolitical standoff. There is no visible cost to the protagonist; the "weighted breath" conceit pauses time to remove urgency rather than heighten it, and the council's instant conversion breaks causal credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative drive lens works well, building sensory texture until the discovery triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration. The ending offers a clear Decisive Change—resuming the path to the clinic—with the "fold in patience" acting as a well-defined structural container for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The scene is structurally functional with clear orientation, but the causal chain is weak; the resolution feels unearned as the woman accepts a complex worldview shift instantly after one metaphor. The ending lands on a "soft reset" where the problem dissolves without significant struggle or complication. The narrative arc is linear but lacks a decisive turning point driven by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is efficient and complete, with a clear causal chain from approach to sealing. However, the resolution of the desert trap via an "instant" magical clearing feels convenient, resolving a physical threat without requiring adaptation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear Situational lens (ritual enactment) with a clear beginning and end, but lacks dramatic tension or a decisive turning point. The resolution—curing decades of communal grief via a single magical alignment—feels unearned by the low on-page cost of merely standing still.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is coherent but linear, moving from observation to solution without complicating pressure. Closure relies on a "victory" beat (announcing a birth) rather than a reconfiguration with felt cost; the "danger" mentioned in the exposition never manifests to test the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, competent arc where the protagonist's tactical response (chalk markers) effectively solves the inciting problem (fading vision). Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis, though the linear problem-solution structure limits complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, effectively utilizing the "sage" archetype to justify a solution that blends mechanics with intuition. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's grief, anchored firmly in the success of the physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is functional and linear, moving smoothly from diagnosis to death, but the "scent of hope" functions as a premature signal of success that undercuts the climax. The closure is clear ("flawless goodbye"), yet it feels like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story demonstrates strong structural integrity with a clear causal chain and a high-quality closure unit (Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis). The circular nature of the ending, reinforced by the memory-wipe constraint, creates a satisfying, resonant cost that effectively recontextualizes the protagonist's effort.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight, with excellent orientation and a decisive Conceptual Repricing closure where the tooth is transformed from evidence of death to a navigational beacon. The pivot from autopsy to "mythological bone-setting" lands with clear purpose and creates a legible before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural (process description) rather than a causal plot; the inciting incident (fog) sets a mood but does not force a hard choice. The flashback provides texture but functions as a pause rather than a pressure point that alters the outcome. Closure is a confirmation of success without a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo or distinct conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a convenient contrivance—the water dripping into a perfect arrow—to direct the protagonist, which weakens the causal chain. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear emotional connection, the path there feels guided by authorial hand rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is solid with a clear objective, extraction, and return; the closure lands effectively with the image of the hollowed character and the glowing shell. However, the progression is linear, lacking a complication that forces a tactical shift or deeper cost beyond physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of obstacles that are overcome immediately without failure or adaptation. The resolution relies on a "magic bullet" mechanism that solves complex societal neglect too neatly, bypassing earned causality or significant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear Accumulative arc (preparation to execution) with legible causality and solid orientation. The closure creates a functional "Earned Stasis" (the artifact is sealed), but the lack of resistance or a high-stakes "snag" limits the dramatic torque.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line from the problem (fading echoes) to a technical solution and a decisive resolution. The closure is excellent: the successful harvest results in the immediate "death" of the cavern’s spirit, a tangible cost that validates the preservation theme.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The situational arc is tightly constructed, moving cleanly from the pressure of the "volatile knot" to the precise mechanical resolution. Closure is strong and resonant, utilizing the "calcified stones" to physically manifest the cost of the transferred grief.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is solid, utilizing the kettle as a constraint to frame the scene. Closure lands clearly (Earned Stasis), though the resolution—mentally transferring grief into wood—feels slightly convenient and lacks on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal arc is flawless; the barter mechanism (stories for truth) sets up a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with undeniable on-page cost—the loss of his collection and the burden of guilt—while the camera wheel’s one-way mechanic perfectly locks the realization in place.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality breaks at the climax when a "fake" carnival prop conveniently possesses the exact refractive index needed to repair high-tech infrastructure. This resolution by coincidence undermines the narrative drive, solving the central obstacle with a lucky find rather than earned ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving efficiently from the sensory inciting incident to the climax. The closure qualifies as a strong Earned Stasis; Elian returns to his duty not out of habit, but through a conscious decision to "bear" the weight, fulfilling the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal spine with a functional deadline (radio silence) that pressures the scene. The closure—lowering the evidence back—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost, effectively resolving the investigative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure without a decisive change or felt cost (required for closure). The climax relies on an internal realization ("Suddenly, the pattern resolved") that bypasses causal friction, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction ending that lacks narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and clean, moving efficiently from observation to intervention to resolution. However, the causality is somewhat low-resistance; the narrator's &quot;magic&quot; works perfectly on the first attempt, resolving the central conflict with a transaction of text rather than a negotiated emotional turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from assembly to hatching to the immediate, crushing realization of incompatibility. Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the success of the experiment creates the tragedy, reweighting the victory as a loss with undeniable cost. The drive lens (Causal) holds perfectly through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic structure, and the closure (the wood humming) successfully lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the father's legacy. However, the plot lacks torque; the protagonist faces no active resistance or complication during the procedure, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned through overcoming a specific obstacle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The resolution relies on a convenient star alignment that strains causality given the "stopped time" premise, and the protagonist’s instantaneous knowledge of this specific cosmic key is unearned. Closure is achieved, but it reads as a low-stakes puzzle solution without a decisive cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid with a clear teleological drive and a Resonant Reconfiguration at the ending. The score is limited because the "perilous transit" is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens the narrative tension in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building through the weeks of lessons to a specific, urgent rupture (the moth). Closure is achieved through a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration: the carving of the new design. The link between the grandfather's urgency, the ribbon's movement, and the final artistic choice is causally tight and conceptually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and logically sound, following a clear Causal/Situational line from detection to correction. The closure is resonant, achieving a "healed timeline" through a specific, physically grounded action that carries thematic weight (the erosion of the wood/sin).

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with a tidy resolution; the discovery of the sovereign case acts as a convenient key that solves the central problem instantly. Closure is legible as a "Conceptual Repricing" of the soul's life, but the lack of resistance makes the arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative momentum stalls in the middle for a substantial block of static exposition ("Elian was an ignorance cartographer... His method was...") that explains the premise rather than dramatizing it. The closure is strong, offering a decisive change with clear ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative establishes a situational drive but resolves the primary arc through a hypothetical future-tense summary ("He would then fold...") rather than on-page dramatization. This explains the magic system's outcome instead of showing it, deflating the tension built by the drone's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, using the rocking chair as a pacing device to great effect. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing via the destruction of the portrait—lands with significant impact. The score is held back slightly by the narrator explicitly summarizing the realization at the end instead of letting the action speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The inciting quest resolves through luck rather than competence when the specific cog is found "miraculously uncorroded" in the muck. This coincidence bridges the gap to the climax too easily, undermining the "hard veracity" ethos of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from instruction to a transcendent peak and a resonant release. The closure is an effective Earned Stasis, where the protagonist accepts the fleeting nature of the victory. The sequence feels logical, though the "physics of empathy" relies on a slight magical realism hand-wave rather than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain (plant grows -> absorbs trauma -> pruning -> sweet fruit) with a legible closure unit. The resolution is earned through procedure rather than struggle, making the victory feel inevitable and the narrative arc flat despite the high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The revelation of the ash is a strong Decisive Change that effectively forecloses the restart option with undeniable cost. However, the riddle sequence functions as an arbitrary pacing stall rather than a pressure-cooker, and the emotional resolution rushes past the necessary processing of the catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from the discovery of the root to a conceptual realization (CR). However, the resolution relies heavily on a coincidence (the fisherman's "inadvertently profound" comment) to unlock the theme, rather than the protagonist arriving there solely through the pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean with a distinct inciting incident and resolution. The mechanism of the vine triggering the mirrors relies on a convenient "Rube Goldberg" logic that feels slightly contrived, but the closure—Elara accepting the burden—is a strong, earned Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal logic of using a paradox to break a perpetual motion trap is clever and well-executed. However, the link between the mathematical escape method and the specific reward (reclaiming the romantic moment) is thematic rather than strictly causal, relying on a convenient "rupture" to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on "symmetric satisfaction"—the protagonist sends a signal, and the world immediately provides the exact desired response without complication. The resolution depends on a massive coincidence (someone knowing the extinct dialect and watching that specific window) that unearned by the prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a brilliant Conceptual Repricing closure; unable to pay the cost of physical preservation (books lost to humidity), the protagonist revalues the "shape of words" into sustenance. The causal chain from the missing beeswax to the culinary annex is logical and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal chain is logical and coherent, leading to a clear Decisive Change (reversing the tide). However, the narrative trajectory is extremely linear—problem, build, fix, success—without complications or the "felt cost" required for higher bands. The victory feels unearned in terms of narrative sacrifice; the solution works perfectly on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is tight and linear, driven by Elias's specific goal to spring a trap. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change that lands with a Conceptual Repricing of his resurrection (admitting he prefers the void). The cost is legible in the "jagged stones" of the confession and the bleakness of the resulting "empty ruin."

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    The plot describes a linear problem-solution arc with a "Competence Porn" structure where the protagonist succeeds exactly as planned. The ending is a clean victory with negligible cost; the "heaving chest" indicates exertion but not a felt narrative price or trade-off for the perfect preservation of the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure—recontextualizing the biological turtles as industrial machines—is executed with precision. The drive lens (Causal/Discovery) holds perfectly from the inciting whistle to the final gear-grinding reveal, with cost legible in the "key to a cage" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    While orientation and the closure action (taking the letter) are clear, the causal link at the climax is weak; the antagonist surrenders too easily to a single argument, making the resolution feel unearned. The cost at closure remains abstract and asserted rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean and focused, with a clear inciting moment and a successful closure that reconfigures the meaning of the repair. The sequence of removing the obstruction and placing the note creates a solid causal chain within the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is robust, with a clear causal link between the inciting incident (blackout) and the resolution. The central mechanic—using the silence to perform a tactile task impossible during normal operations—creates a satisfying, logical path to closure. The ending successfully recontextualizes the setting through the revealed information.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient and causal, moving cleanly from the inciting timeframe to the release. While the "blood acting as a binding agent" is a slightly convenient mechanical bridge, the closure—reconfiguring the wife's departure through the crane—lands with genuine structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the "cooling breakers" constraint, creating a natural, high-pressure window for the scene. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change—an active choice to break reality to regain the vision—perfectly satisfying the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.4)
    The story follows a linear fetch-quest structure that ends with a "Magic MacGuffin" resolution. The chip solves the protagonist's internal conflict instantly ("change was instantaneous") with no visible or felt cost, failing the closure requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from descent to realization, with a legible closure unit (finding the watch hand). The retrieval of the specific watch hand from "driftwood" relies on fable-logic coincidence, but it effectively serves the closure. The pacing is steady, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence to resolve the central crisis: the brass drawer pull happening to fit the steel mechanism perfectly. While thematically resonant, this "lucky fit" solves the conflict without requiring a tactical adaptation or sacrifice from the protagonist, undercutting the earned causality of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean and functional, utilizing a clear Situational/Internal lens where the environment forces a reconfiguration of the self. Closure is achieved through a valid Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elias accepts the "shallows" and rejects the compass with a tangible cost to his pride.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is decisive and resonant; the sacrifice of the time-travel baseball serves as a tangible cost for reclaiming his humanity, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration standard. The causal chain from the failed procedure to the oracle's revelation is tight, with the "Source" logically forcing the climax. The ending successfully reconfigures the protagonist's stance with a legible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is tight: ritual leads to descent, which necessitates transformation, leading to the bond. The connection between the fortune cookie's prophecy ("become the sky") and the specific physical change (turning into diamond/silicate) is poetic but structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear causal chain: ritual setup, execution, revelation, and reaction. The closure is a valid form of Earned Stasis, where the character actively chooses to maintain his delusion at the cost of genuine healing. The "Orientation Test" is passed immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear linear cause-and-effect chain (ritual leads to integration, which opens the door), providing a legible arc. However, the resolution relies on "magic physics" established solely for this scene, making the success feel somewhat convenient. The transition from "trudging" to "floating" works structurally but lacks a moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on explicit coincidence ("Had Silas not...") and external forces ("The universe... orchestrates") to move the plot. While the accidental resolution is a prompt requirement, the execution feels mechanical and lacks a causal chain driven by the protagonist. Closure lands, but it is unearned by character action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path with valid closure, but the execution is devoid of obstacles. The blackout conveniently removes all surveillance, and the "panicked superiors" provide no active resistance, reducing the plot to a procedural checklist rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is impeccable, moving from preparation to execution to a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship with the world. The ending serves as a powerful "Earned Stasis," delivering a moment of profound relief that is strictly earned by the mechanics established in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear arc with a distinct objective and high stakes, satisfying the basic causal requirements. However, the resolution is a straightforward success without a complicating twist or new cost paid within the scene; the ending lands on a realization that feels somewhat safe and expected.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a severe causality gap: the antique sewing tin functioning as a cipher key for the sundial is asserted ("the object was the cipher key") rather than earned or explained. This turns the climax into a convenience-driven puzzle solution rather than an organic narrative outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative structure is a functional linear vignette with clear orientation and a legible ending (Conceptual Repricing of the ruins). However, the piece lacks causal density; the inciting transition (the molt) and the climax (the planting) occur without obstruction or complication, resulting in a flat narrative arc. The closure lands an image of "beginning," but the path there feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is cohesive with a distinct inciting incident and resonant closure. However, the resolution relies on a convenient "theoretical loophole" regarding film physics that functions as a magical shortcut rather than a causally earned breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight; the mechanism of "reality checking" leads directly to the climax via the kaleidoscope and syntax verification. The transition from the illusory Silver City to the barren rock constitutes a distinct, earned reversal (Decisive Change). The ending achieves closure with a tangible cost—the loss of beauty for a harsh truth—and an image of Earned Stasis as he shields the sprout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building pressure through the ritual steps to a decisive release. The closure is legible and provides a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's state, though the resolution—guilt dispersing into "harmless particles"—feels like a slightly convenient soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the dust transfer crystallizes his reconfigured stance—cosmic scale acknowledged in terrestrial fragility—cost is the unavoidable weight of endings. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each studied decay image deepens density until the final pattern break (beauty intrudes on data). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor elasticity: the implant “falter” beat is stated not shown, a hairline slip that doesn’t rupture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the frost-negative tracks re-weight her world, turning passive survival into active pursuit; the ledger strip vibrates in her hand, a felt cost that locks the lens (Accumulative/Textural) without contradiction. Causality is tight—thermal memory → frost pattern → forward motion—no plot amnesia or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: cold spot threatens orchids → fork-rod intervention → thermal bloom restored. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white flare of the orchid is a silent shout that reweights the premise—music now equals visible heat. Cost is visible—chest heaving, rod dulled—but the lens stays Causal throughout. A hairline slip: “memory of the freezing ocean wave” is told, not shown mid-act, barely holding it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: package → descent → installation → acknowledgment → silence. The lighthouse-as-receiver is a crisp conceptual pivot that delivers the required Conceptual Repricing closure: the beam reframes centuries of panic into finished business. Cost is visible in the slump against the dais and the stolen moment of manufactured quiet. No orientation or continuity errors; metaphysical rule-set is announced early and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell ritual reweights contraband as sacrament, foreclosing the path of public leadership and leaving Elara on solitary guard—cost is legible in the final image of wind and bell-weight. Causal chain holds: embargo → midnight run → anonymous distribution → ritual consecration → tighter social fabric. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices at this length; the embargo’s choke and the bell’s hush satisfy Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tight causal chain: memory → quest → apparatus tweak → breath-match → golden projection → dispersal; each step narrows options and the final image (lighter chest) is a felt Decisive Change. Orientation is locked by word 50; no teleporting props; closure reweights the premise under Causal lens with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: because he is retrocognitively anchored, therefore he steals the fragment, therefore he hyper-knots the bridge, therefore the 2-D prison bursts. The midpoint tightening arrives when the first photograph warps—visible hinge that forecloses return to nostalgia. Closure is the tactile “now” replacing the flat snapshots; cost is the physical shiver of the bridge and thegray dust on his skin. One scaffold loop (“He began to weave… he began to weave”) slightly blunts propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: wall breach → looters enter → Elias deciphers keys → arrow seals vault → capture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and serve closure. Closure is a Decisive Change with undeniable cost: the vault’s survival purchased by his surrender. No teleporting props; the arrow’s pedigree is implied through grain-fletching detail rather than retroactive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: every beat is a because/therefore linkage—cells divide ⇒ imprint must occur now ⇒ Forge releases silence ⇒ pathways twist. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands on-page: the device now carriers “the memory of treason,” a social/ethical cost legible in the final line. Persistent constraint (biological window) shapes tactics throughout. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. High-band quick test met with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (theft → decoding → jar development → projection) is a because/therefore chain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the traveler’s future-seeing gaze reweights Elara’s premise—she is not invisible to fate—and the milky jar in her lap is visible cost. Anchors arrive by line 5; no orientation debt. One micro-turn (she was watcher, now watched) tightens the stake without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he abandons the sanctuary, leaving the cooling dome as monument, tangible cost etched in the final image. Causal chain (thaw → structure failure → forced exit) holds; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 80. One transition (studio→slope) is clean. No lens ambiguity; pressure tightens once. Meets 9− gate with cost visible in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is tight: betrayal → panic → cast decryption → protocol inversion. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—Elias traps himself to burn Julian’s perimeter. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift. Lens (Causal) holds without ambiguity; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gold flake pressed onto the blank vellum reweights the booklet from sacred relic to tombstone of light. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence thickens until wind simply “vanishes,” a pattern break that reweights stakes. Causality remains intact—each silence-summary advances the map. Cost is undeniable: star dies, storm dies, gold stripped to gray.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the violin’s transformation from transparent to storm-cloud grey reweights the facility’s reality-waste economy and 734’s Sisyphean search. Causal linkage holds—curiosity → containment → data archive—without outline drift. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 2 and never blurs. The persistent constraint is the nightly reset: tomorrow’s wedding re-do will bury the violin’s meaning deeper, a cost felt in the recycler’s clang.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure earns Charged Poise: the lens reconfigures trust under the Accumulative lens—each ticket’s residue layers density until the final hush amplifies peace. Causality intact: because he hoards margins, therefore he can offer Mara the lens; because she feels the ache, therefore she forgives. Orientation crisp by 45 words. Cost crystallized in “sharing the burden of his crime.” No lens-ambiguity; pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect CR: the cracked marble’s refracted beam re-prices “broken=worthless” into “broken=brilliant,” forcing the reader to re-see the entire system. Causal chain is clean: because Elian kept the marbles as penance, therefore he can weaponize their flaw under the sun’s angle. Lens is accumulative/textural; the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation and causality are intact; no scaffolding artifacts dull the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hologram collapses, the secret is banked, and the wrench’s weight re-anchors him to linear life—cost is the foreclosed escape. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (icy warmth, phantom flutter, steel lever) tightens the stakes until the final image reweights them. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: “sideways time” is named before the hologram teaches us what that means, a micro-timing twitch keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: baton raised, silence resolved, Elias’s fate rewritten. Causal linkage holds throughout: because he obeys the ghost’s water-map, therefore he gains the baton; because he gains it, the silence feels complete. Orientation, stakes, and lens are legible by line 5 and never drift. The final image reweights every prior beat with undeniable conceptual cost: he is no longer a spectator but the inheritor of a drowned orchestra.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he hid the catastrophic variable, therefore he must bury it differently; the smudge-attack on the engine’s confidence interval is the irreversible beat that widens “swaying certainties” into fatal fog. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the apocalypse is not averted, only redistributed as atmospheric noise—cost felt in the hollow ache under auroral sorrow. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at the end. Persistent constraint—the station’s optical scanner now keyed to his biological tremor—shapes future tactics, satisfying 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of auditory and tactile static until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: Silas releases the wheel, foreclosing the option to indict himself alone, and the mattress commercial ruptures the sacred silence with undeniable social cost. The valve wheel, radio, and ghost machinery are persistent constraints that shape every tactical step. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s passage into regenerative silence forever forecloses her role as Chronicle Keeper, the obsidian refuge reframing her witness stance into eternal stillness. Causal linkage holds—each fold in the swan is a because/therefore step narrowing location until the paper aperture literally relocates her. The orientation anchor (who/where) is taught by line 3 and payoff is the inverted whiteness → black shore transition, waiving any penalty. Cost is legible in the final image: “keeper of the quiet that follows the end of stories,” a conceptual price that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine—eclipse → curl → memory spike—lands with a crisp Decisive Change in Elara. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4, beating the 120-word mark. Cost is present yet one-sided: Elara’s reawakening is palpable; Elias’s risk or sacrifice is not, keeping the closure just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry fragment becomes a memorial to extinct magnetism and extinct sleep; Elian’s recognition reweights the world’s insomnia. Causal linkage holds: diary → tapestry → axis myth → silence accepted. The “bronze quiet” that opens and closes the piece supplies a persistent, metallic cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no debt incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: prophetic glitch → moral crisis → sabotage-as-resignation, each “therefore” legible under a causal lens. The lighthouse-as-transmitter is set up early; the manual override pays off in a luminous CR that rewrites the night sky. Closure lands with undeniable cost—Arthur exiles himself from the network in real time—though the leap from fear to action could use one intermediate beat to show the final threshold crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the Vantablack puddle reverts to “simply matter,” reweighting the premise that creative void = annihilation. Causal chain holds—each rhetorical loop tightens the entity’s grip until silence pockets sever it. Orientation achieved by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in Elias’s collapse and Kellen’s sweat-slick cables; the price of priestly certainty is perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored horizon + nautilus chord crystallizes options and reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—“the fortune he had written for himself had come true” now exacts perpetual exile from that boy-time. Causal lens holds throughout: because he maps memories → therefore filters wind → because dawn strikes → therefore chord bridges temporal selves. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by word 88. No telegraphing or soft resets; every beat tightens the tuning toward that final image. The persistent constraint—altitude, cold, irreproducible atmospheric silence—shapes every tactic and charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the droplet’s ripple reweights the entire ruleset, fusing timelines and locking the viaduct into permanence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (static-charge air, shifting stone, tablet vibration) intensifies until the elastic compression snaps at the landing. Because/therefore causality is intact—tablet crumbles because its coordinate function is spent; bridge solidifies because she pays gravity’s price. Cost is visible in bone-level thud and “crushing burden,” no off-stage cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the filament of hush snaps, sorrow floods in, stance is reconfigured (“ready to teach again”) with felt cost. Causal chain—broken stylus → counter-spin → filament extraction → trance → tear—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful tightening suffices. Orientation is anchored by ~60 words; no teleport or luck. Minor waiver: the belt-drive mechanics are elided, yet the reader is taught the ritual’s purpose early enough to accept the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: she is perched above her ruined life, thumb on the tube, options re-priced. Causal chain (pursuit → lateral escape → data saved) holds under Causal lens; the tube’s arrival is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. The orientation anchors (who/when/where) are crystalline by line 4; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of escalating sensory density (grey → neon → iridescent) tightens until the Lily’s bloom releases the blue cloud that reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she reseals the vial, accepting perpetual haunting—Earned Stasis with felt cost (“dull, rhythmic ache”). No orientation debt; UV reveal rules taught on-page. Causality intact: because she risks inhalation, therefore memory floods, therefore she traps the ghost again.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Silas’s deliberate destruction of the spiral reweights the premise—time’s texture is friction, not transcendence—at undeniable cost (he forfeits omniscience). Causal chain holds: rope ritual → temporal contact → fiber burn → choice to retreat. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Minor time-stamp fuzziness (“three winters ago”) is allowed under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative-textural lens: each sensory layer (hush, rust, salt-rot, glass hum) adds density until the dome itself becomes a cello body, re-weighting stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final suspended note conceptually re-prices silence from void to canvas—undeniable cost is Elara’s perpetual auditory pain kept alive. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks; dome’s resonance foreshadowed in “fragile lung” opener and paid off when glass answers the violin. Fire-lighting sequence supplies because/otherwise: without her flint-spark the ritual—and thus the communal reconfiguration—cannot occur.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the blotter’s synthetic nostalgia reweights reality, leaving Elara glassily serene and the grotto warmer. Causal chain holds: because she is shattered → therefore Silas offers half-truth → result is bearable false peace. One shard, one transition (dusk → night) is cleanly handled. Cost is visible—“transaction finished, the illusion absolute”—but the price to Silas (static silence) is mentioned, not felt, so it stops just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: mis-delivered envelope → inquiry → night delivery → locket return → invitation. Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the empty chairs and “library open as long as the stars are out” crystallize new reciprocity with felt social cost—he stays, she accepts, both risk visibility. No orientation debt; place, time, and agency anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the final image; no persistent constraint, so 9+ gate not quite cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian pillar wears a living coat of grass, reweighting the orchard’s eternal hardness with mortal ephemera. Causal linkage holds: because she comforts the boy, the elders open their mental web; therefore she can complete the weave and be clasped in. Accumulated texture (chiming quartz, thermal updrafts) tightens until the final hush. Cost is legible in the last image—her spent reeds, the boy’s blood on silica—so the lens (Hybrid→Accumulative at end) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she needs speed she borrows time; therefore the world freezes; because the giant stirs the stasis cracks; therefore she must flee. Closure is a Charged Poise—the sketch finished, the city roaring, her body aged—“a masterpiece stolen from the edge of oblivion” reweights all prior bargains. Cost is visible in the same sentence as the final image. Orientation taught by word 70 (“rooftop canal system”)—no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the meadow image rewrites “vanished” into “relocated somewhere calculable,” a Decisive Change in the rule-set of grief. Causal lattice holds: because the cracks are read as chaotic algorithm, therefore the silver sap is poured; because the eyes flare, therefore the equation gains a new variable. Orientation is taught early by sensory drip and mineral taste; no spatial or temporal drift. The final beat—“ready to recalculate”—pays the persistent constraint: the Orchard will demand another night, another ritual, an open-ended cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → rattling debris → tape find → cache → visibility renunciation, each beat narrowing options. Closure is a Charged Poise: shared discovery reconfigures both lives while Elias’s isolation endures—cost is legible in the sealed hatch and lingering shadow. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 5; no orientation debt. Minor loop: “kindly methodical pace” appears twice; doesn’t touch the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the moment he opens his hand and yields to the moss, options reconfigure and the cost (human form, identity) is legible in the rain-as-growth sensation. Causal lens holds throughout—each failed attempt to reverse the graft tightens the trap. One minor telegraph: “you cannot reverse a season…” insight arrives as aphorism rather than discovered cause; still, the final image reweights all prior resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: insomnia → rain-trail → tunnel reveal → amber → filter trade → painting vow, each because/therefore linkage narrowing options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the brooch in pocket reweights “witness” into “maker,” cost felt in the filter he will soon thirst for. No teleports; geography tracks as tide rises. The subway rib/coral image is the on-page DC that makes the ruin newly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s mundane-wonder broadcast reweights Elara’s perception of prophecy itself, cost signaled by her explicit renunciation of future-fixation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of bioluminescent detail and cadence shift in the pearl’s song tighten the stake once. Orientation anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks. One hairline scaffold: “For the first time in her life” is template cadence, but it lands outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Elian alone possesses the valve and reactive vision, therefore he acts; staggered intervals reweight stakes by turning silence into permission. Closure lands as Decisive Change—community re-coalesces—paid for by Elian’s irreversible step onto the public stage. Cost is legible in the final image: his slowed hand, the hanging note, the weeping crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the goodbye was not an exit, but a reintegration” reweights the premise with undeniable cost—his erasure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm → shard → breach → dissolution tightens through density and cadence, not causal chains. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“fold between seconds”) and pays off when that fold buckles, waiving any penalty. One slight wobble: the rule-set for “dimensionally aware” mind-drill is asserted late; still, the final image obeys the logic established.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because Julian inherits honesty, therefore he wields the ink; because the ink liquefies rigidity, therefore Vance signs. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Vance’s worldview breached. Orientation is clean by word 80; no teleporting props. The breach is earned, not lucky. Slight stretch: ink’s rule is asserted, not pre-taught, but payoff justifies the late rule.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure delivers a crisp Charged Poise: the forged memory lands with tactile cost (“cold, sharp echo…pulse against her skin”), satisfying lens consistency; causal chain is thin—why this exact lamp angle matters is asserted, not demonstrated—but the ending reconfigures stakes cleanly, fulfilling the Accumulative/Textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory graft thickens the label’s “invisible weight” until the object vibrates with a sorrow that did not exist before. The closure is a Charged Poise: the label fixed in a pavement crack becomes a monument that reconfigures the city’s breath as archive. Cost is legible in the final image—he “brushed the dust from my coat,” a quiet gesture that pays the price of perpetual erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “riddle has no answer, only a song” reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift rather than causal plot turns—and holds cleanly to the last line. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; no debt. Persistent constraint: the half-finished cello’s raw wood literally absorbs the dying sky, shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: every graffiti coordinate narrows options until the stone’s relocation forces a legal reframing, a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost. The orientation anchors by word 30, so no penalty; only the mild emotional smoothing keeps this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because he is a curious rule-breaker → illicit summit → invents undetectable timer → endures drones/frost → captures final dark → mirror array activates. The “chemical strip turns crimson” moment supplies an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost—his body shivers, fingertip bleeds, and the colony’s eternal day begins. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure is clean, though the conceptual repricing could be sharper—the image is strong but stops just short of reconfiguring future options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the hummingbird’s hum fuses with the departing airship’s roar, reweighting Elias’s quiet endurance as the price of perfection. Causal chain is immaculate: misaligned gyro → refracted light → micro-servo tweak → firmware patch → flight. No teleporting props; the looming anchor lift is tracked auditorily across beats. Cost is felt in the fading sound—his world darkens again once the drone leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the breath-map reveals rivers begin in converging intent, then dissolves—Silas records nothing, paying the price of permanent secrecy. Causal lens holds: each beat (falcon → dog-ear → condensation) tightens options until the final renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no penalty. One causality hairline: the phrase “metaphysical source of flow” is declared, not dramatized, slightly softening the inciting stake.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pedestrian beat layers vibration into the arch until pattern-break (synced march) reweights stakes. Closure delivers Charged Poise—Silas retreats, city momentarily stable, entropy merely postponed—cost is the perpetual burden he accepts. Causality is metaphoric yet internally consistent; the fork’s swallowing of discord teaches the rule early. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the completed transmission crystallizes her fate while the beam’s ascent reweights the premise—she is now encoded light. Causal linkage holds (because she unsnarls → beam fires → she accepts death). Cost is unmistakable in the graying vision line. One persistent constraint (O2 countdown) shapes every tactic. Slight lens wobble early (is this Situational or Accumulative?) but the ending locks into Accumulative density; hence −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elian literally re-prices the physics of the prison, vanishing into “neglected space.” Cost is legible in the guards’ discovery of emptiness and the ozone tang. Drive lens is Causal: cracked lens warning → wreck → scapegoat fear → chase hush → door exploit. Scuffed-door exit is set up by “builders had been careless with their enchantments.” No teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is crisp: bead-signal → orchard awakening → ghost appears → breath-cure → ledger closed. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (rusted latch, frost vs. humid greenhouse) so the Orientation Test is satisfied. Closure lands with visible cost—the spectral departure is the irrevocable price of survival—under a tight Causal lens. One minor softness: the bead’s dissolution into “pure light” is named, not explained; a half-line on what light feels like entering ghost-flesh would clinch the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: dawn reveals the stitched canyon, making decay reversible at felt cost—her exhaustion and the scar-visible proof. Causality follows Accumulative/Textural logic: each dream-loop stitch tightens the mesh until the canyon’s “tapestry” reweights meaning. One transition (sunset→dawn) is legible; orientation anchored by line 4. No lens ambiguity; cost is visible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unearthed relic adds density until the sundial shadow re-weights time itself. The ~120-word anchor rule is met (who/where/when by “diaspora returnee…catacomb orchard”). Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the moment the beam hits the dial, options reconfigure—time resumes, exile loops into circle—cost is the week of dust-lung labor and the irreversible knowledge that sky once closed. No causality breaks, though the “circle” epiphany is slightly announced rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the folded letter stepping into the brass chute reweights the stakes—physicality vs. erasure—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact but light; the chalk code is read without friction and the letter’s journey is accepted on faith, so the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (slowness, exposure) rather than visceral, yet the image of dawn-lit arcade and disappearing chalk makes the reconfiguration legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain locks tight: Kael’s demand → Lysa’s hidden sabotage via embroidered map → trap revealed to Chancellor’s side; closure carries conceptual cost (her life now forfeit if mask slips), lens holds. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the gargoyle broke when he left, therefore he brings it; because moonlight heals stone, the conduit opens; because the message is read, he chooses to write. Orientation is clean by line 10; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shard re-fuses and the window writes *Don’t go*—options narrow from “Can I fix the past?” to “Can I answer her silence?” Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he cannot unsay the knowledge; the cost is the unwriteable letter he now must write. Persistent constraint: the re-broken shard he carries out literalizes the irreversible break.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby rewrite crystallizes a before/after with felt cost—the cast’s terror is conceptually repriced, Elias’s own chest “unknotted.” Causal linkage holds: because he decodes the mortar warning, therefore he grafts the lullaby, therefore the memory can sett le clean. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of signatures tightens until pattern break—and the final mist-blanket image recharges it. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the orchard-cathedral dissolves, re-weighting art as momentary gift—conceptual cost legible in “beautiful futility.” Causal chain holds: fragment → network → light-paint → display → fade, each because/therefore. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: the word “display” is used narratively before it is enacted, softening the turning point; keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each awakening layers density until the echo decays into earned stasis. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the grinning nickel reweights the curator’s question with conceptual cost. Pattern is taught by word 50 (“microscopic pause”) and paid off in the final line; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the scanners crash, the ledger blanks, Julian exits in “beautiful, silent void.” Causal chain holds—garden code → greenhouse rendezvous → seed acoustics → system overload—though the acoustics paradox is asserted not demonstrated, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the postcard interred, Elias forecloses nostalgic obsession and accepts perpetual sleepless vigil. The Acc/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of song → sprout → jungle → surrender—each cadence reweighting loss into atmosphere. Cost is unmistakable: “his hands finally empty,” alone inside a cradle he can never truly sleep in. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“bottom of the gargantuan shell”) so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each polished leaf and tuned chime thickens the texture until the cracked bamboo snaps the pattern, forcing a sonic seam that re-ignites the orchid. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the crystalline note reweights the premise—names stay adrift, Elian stays, loneliness endures—charged poise with felt cost. No orientation debt; pattern taught by 25 % mark. Cost is legible in the final image of rain-like names falling to a dead world.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: because Elara forces the spell, therefore the room threatens to tear apart; because she speaks each vow, the syntax stabilizes—each linkage visible on the page. Closure is a Decisive Change: the archive’s silence becomes a living bridge, cost paid in the violet burns on her gloves and the irrevocable spoken vows. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (table, ink well, door) remain coherent. The final image reconfigures their relational options with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: resin discovery → hidden bypass plan → thermal-breath window → chain restraint → false "Closed" reading; each because/therefore link narrows options and raises exposure. Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the city’s sensors now lie, Elian is irreversibly a saboteur, chain slack in shadow = persistent future risk; cost is legible in the false gauge and his sweat. Orientation and lens hold cleanly through single-scene arc.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bird’s upward arc reconfigures both solitude and secrecy into fragile shared hope, cost felt in the simultaneous bloom/decay of “blooming withering.” Causal lens holds: because she followed paper receipts, therefore trust is risked; because attic air swirls, therefore capsule is balanced; because meteorite needs altitude, therefore silence is released. Single scene, one transition (trapdoor entry), orientation clear by word 80. No off-stage resolution; final image crystallizes stakes without exposition. Minor keep from 9: the woman’s off-page navigation of receipts is recounted, not dramatized, a hairline causality scuff.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“jagged shards of quiet”) and held: each sensory shard adds density until the grain-reading collapses distance into meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—her single step back reconfigures the entire chaotic timeline by reimposing distance. The cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she accepts eternal exile from the fused world to give reality back its “here” and “there.” No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are vivid by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the synchronized exhale fogging the glass reweights belonging from abstract yearning to embodied communion; the burnt feather’s placement seals renunciation with felt cost. Causal chain holds: Kael’s manual harmonics → bioluminescent summons → Elara’s release, each step shrinking her options until endurance becomes choice. “Until sunrise” clock is signaled early and tightens the final beat without forcing artificial jeopardy. No orientation debt; underwater rules stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain: seed drop → foam reaction → glass discovery → transliteration → conjecture → revelation → acceptance, all within one geode location. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “missing path” is redefined as deliberate self-crystallization, with the cost that Elara’s life-work is exploitation of that choice. One minor causality bump: the glass’s emotion-mapping rule is revealed only at midpoint, yet Elara instantly weaponizes it; still, the artifact’s behavior stays consistent thereafter. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop gone, Elias concealed, the woman’s stance reconfigured from slump to luminous laughter—undeniable conceptual cost to him (loss of talisman) and her (indebted to an invisible benefactor). Causal chain is immaculate: tide → vibration → bishop → can → machine → tokens → laugh; every step is foreshadowed by the metallic salt-spray world-building, so coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is established within the first 90 words and never wavers. Drive lens is Causal and holds without ambiguity to the final image of tickets “spewing like a golden paper fountain.”

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the verse hardens into biology, foreclosing return with luminous cost visible on the skin. Causal chain is lean—alignment → inscription → irreversible fusion—taught early and paid off. The nostalgia ban is sketched only as backdrop; because it never threatens in-scene, the political stake feels conceptual rather than imminent, muting the tightening. Still, the final step into darkness reconfigures her universe and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each glass shard, tide ring, and color burst layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no debt. The closure is a Charged Poise—the atrium ignites, reframing “broken” as necessary for light; the cost is the irreversible exposure of his crude materials to public view. Causality is lyric rather than plot-linear, appropriate to the lens, and the pattern is taught early (“clarity was often a matter of perspective”).

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the soot release reweights his bargain with innocence, and the cost—ash of a friend now irretrievably wind-borne—is legible. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern-taught early via kiln/fire sibling metaphor and held to the final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure. The only hairline slip: the tightening turn (scatter) is more ceremonial than tactical, so the cost feels symbolic rather than constraint-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: gray entropy menace → encoding balloon → ascent → visible color return—all "because/therefore" links with no off-stage rescue. Orientation: who/where/when set by line 3; grotto rules learned through action. Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the gray recoil and heavier present land with undeniable conceptual cost—the saved world now demands living weight. One hairline wobble: the balloon pierces solid rock with zero pre-established rule; the payoff charms but borders on convenient magic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage is tight: because the echo feels heavy with despair, therefore Elias digs, therefore he finds the diaries and film, therefore the acoustic map in his mind is permanently re-weighted—an undeniable Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are crystal-clear within first 60 words; no penalty. Closure lands on the page: the final click returns a “changed and somber” sound that embodies the new knowledge, closing the loop between premise and ending under the inferred Causal lens. Cost is visible: he physically pockets the evidence and accepts the audible scream as his own burden, foreclosing the option to remain a detached surveyor.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a crisp Charged Poise: the bell scatters the light and the mirror snaps back, but the man is already moving—cost is the irreversible exposure of her intervention. Causal chain is tight: rain → prism → lullaby → heartbeat → image → bell break. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (acoustic suspension lost at bell) shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: celestial silence → ritual demand → name-offering → signature, each step shrinking options. The silver sheet turn is a perfect micro-reversal that makes the debt visible. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“peace was…a burden”—and the clipboard’s weight forecloses further negotiation, satisfying Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg is left in the fissure, the storm drop hisses, and the reader feels the before/after—silence now freighted with possible birth. Causal lens holds throughout: every beat links because/therefore to Vance’s secret sentiment vs public guilt. The cracked-clay map is introduced early, paid off at the kneel. Cost is unmistakable: “he turned his back on the hidden life,” salt already filming his $800 shoes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she withholds her body, therefore she retains the inner precision to unpick the knot; because the thread snaps, therefore the Lullaby shatters. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (Silver Courtyard, night, snowfall). Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing—the Prism’s burst rewrites the social contract in one sonic boom, cost legible in the Magistrates’ collapsed bliss. The beat sequence is single-scene, one meaningful tightening; no causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches its backwards-run pattern early and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the undoing of the tragedy reweights the audience’s (and reader’s) moral calculus. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the lens holds. Cost is felt in the hush itself—an echo of violence that never happened—though the price to Silas remains implicit. The Orientation Test is passed inside 120 words; spatial anchors (acoustic tiles, swinging bulb) are crisp and continuous.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the interrupted cadence becomes legible when the monarch hesitates beside the grey wing, reweighting Elias’s premise that all loss matters. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through mirrored wings and collapsing structure—held cleanly to the final bruised-sky image. Cost is unmistakable: “when the wind rose, his signal would fall… scattering the moth wing and the monarch alike.” No orientation or telegraphing issues; all cues anchor early.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the card’s fragile data becomes a resonant bronze plate, the cost the literal incineration of the paper memory. Lens is Causal: each re-knot of the rope tightens atmospheric energy that melts the bronze, itself the consequence of Elias’s self-forgiveness. No orientation debt; anchors are vivid by line 50. Cost is on-page: the aurora’s heat sears skin and the card is ash before the pour.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: pulling the lever opens the bunker to the storm, paying with the irreversible loss of shelter. Causal chain holds: dream-vision → locate box → break seal → pull lever, each step because/therefore under the situational lens. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 60 via concrete bunker decay and storm countdown; no penalty. One minor causality bump: the Steward’s “mathematically calculated cheekiness” is asserted rather than demonstrated, but this does not derail the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the covenant is sealed, knowledge hidden forever, and the cost is the astronomer’s lifelong light. Causal chain holds—each torch snuffed, each chalk line drawn, leads to the stasis of lights above the tile. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of oil saved, stars mapped, and diagrams hum until pattern crystallizes in the final dark. The price is legible in the last breath of ozone and the absolute black he chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the cylinder’s vanishing reweights Kaelen’s identity under the broken-pin mercy. Causal lens holds—every reappearance of the cylinder is a motivated therefore—though “cellular memory” mechanism is asserted rather than primed, a hairline nick to causality.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored orchard rewrites the district’s ontology, the bell-like ring making the cost audible. Accumulative lens holds: every breath thickens the lattice until the world flips into glass. Causality is intact but thin—no intermediate reversals, only steady accretion; the sextant “locks” once, no further tightening. The price is legible in the instant he touches air and it sings, yet no persistent constraint (frozen feet, cracked lungs) is dramatized after the flip.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: town’s frozen vow → magical fester → Elara’s failed stitch → ribbon hinge → golden release. Orientation anchors inside 120 words (who, where, when, problem). Decisive Change lands on-page: the rift’s violet fury audibly softens after the loose knot, crystallizing a before/after that costs Elara her certainty of permanent fixes. One hairline slip: the “ozone and rotting pears” cue is never re-visited to confirm the breach is truly healed; still, the audible hum and settling rafters satisfy felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: carving his own fear into the shell reweights the entire causal loop with undeniable ontological cost. The lens is Causal—because/therefore links hold from manifest-to carved-shell-to lineage survival. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (asteroid, void, curator). The single shard design is tight; the toilet-flush cadence acts as both comic and causal punctuation. One hairline slip: “he would find tomorrow” leans on future-tense convenience; a present-tighten would have pushed this to 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: missing data → renegotiation → release → extraction, each step because/therefore linked. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the mountain “settles,” satisfied by the new knowledge, and the Traveler is freed with the implicit price that the mountain keeps its cataloging supremacy. The price is more conceptual than viscerally felt by Elara, but the logic is airtight under the Accumulative/Textural lens (knowledge-density reweights reality). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each narrative utterance thickens the ship’s reality until the garden’s mold mirrors her cellular merger. Closure is a Charged Poise: pocketing the card crystallizes the new configuration—sister remains inside, unborn and painless. Cost is palpable: she gives up the chance to externalize the twin, accepting permanent internal haunt. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by line 3; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope snaps taut, the bell rings pure, and the university’s memory is restored—cost is felt in the dissolved wax and the “fraction of a second” Elian lingers, knowing no one will read his report. Causal chain is clean: wax template → weave → merge →钟楼同步; no prop teleporting or convenient amnesia. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (pocket watch, clock-tower door), well before 120-word mark. Drive lens is causal throughout; each beat narrows options until the single decisive tug reweights reality. The ending’s conceptual price (archival anonymity) is legible and poignant, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: the bloom of hush lands on-page, dissolves the beings, and leaves Elara pinned beneath a “warm blanket of iron.” Causal lens holds: each beat is “because/therefore” from first screech to final stillness. Orientation locked by line 3; no teleporting props. Cost is irreversible—stone spent, silence weaponized—meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is pristine: prism find → silence bubble → star alignment → beam eruption, each step because/therefore. Closure delivers Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the world’s noise is momentarily defeated and watchers are forcibly re-oriented. Orientation is locked by line 3; no lens drift. Persistent constraint (the tower’s thousand-year cycle) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill capped, the window to the past sealed, the cost—“the long static dark”—legible in the final image. The accumulative lens holds: each sensuous detail (ozone, crystal voices, shadow creep) tightens the noose of cultural preservation until the archive becomes the sole aperture. Persistent constraint—the cooling stylus and solidifying sky—shapes every beat. No causality break; orientation is taught by the crystal chorus within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lattice holds: mosaic recipe → humidity adjustment → timed ignition → emerald bloom. Closure is Charged Poise: he steps into darkness, lighter for having spent his fire. Cost legible in spent mortars and his resumed chant—hope given, self emptied. Orientation anchored by dusk rampart walk within 120 words; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide-pool image re-weights the relationship with undeniable cost (“mornings…alone”). Accumulative lens holds: each micro-observation thickens until the silence ruptures. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. The cicada’s warmth transferred from pocket to speech is the persistent constraint that shapes the final permission.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the wax-sealed doll now holds an inverted sky, a legible before/after with conceptual cost. Causality is sound under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory denial thickens the silence until it precipitates gold. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 6 and holds. A minor causality gap: we are told but not shown how the doll’s ceramic anatomy “traps” soundless light; the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than rule-demonstrated, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the terrace’s lattice hums anew, Kael’s stance softens, and silence is re-priced as maternal. Causal linkage (whistle-shatter risk → drop → harmonic mend) is airtight. The lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore that tightens until the final image crystallizes cost without needing to pay it twice.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: every beat obeys because/therefore—deadline countdown strips options until she must leap onto flickering light-stair. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 20; no penalty. Closure is Decisive Change: “hand syncing” with throne rewrites city’s atmospheric future and her own role; sunrise glare is visible price. No teleporting props or soft resets; mural-peel mechanic seeded early and paid off at apex.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because she refuses to release the ring, therefore the threshold dissolves; because she drops it, her stance reconfigures. Anchors—who/where/when—are fixed by line 3; no orientation debt. Closure is the visible, audible thud that swallows the sound and the threshold, a Decisive Change with felt cost. The persistent constraint (no bridges, no door) shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Elias once fled promises, therefore he now stays to transmute one; micro-choices tighten until the bolt becomes diamond. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the bolt’s erasure and the diamond’s appearance—reconfiguring his identity from prey to alchemist. No teleporting props; the bolt is introduced, handled, and annihilated on-page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear inside 120 words; cavern, phone, apron all track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each crank turn tightens possibility because the acoustic lock’s physics are foreshadowed, therefore the crystal must shatter when the true frequency is hit. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Imperial Archives”) and the timeline (“first yawn of evening”) is stable; no penalty. The single-scene default is met; the reversal (god-voice → thief-laugh) is a decisive change broadcast outward, paying the cost in social rupture. Minor slack: the “standing wave” mechanic is exposited late, so the escalation’s stakes are confessed rather than progressively discovered, but the closure still lands with unmistakable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the instant the pod drops, “armor loses weight,” history unwrites, possibility is literally in hand—an undeniable before/after. Causal chain is intact—each marionette step because/therefore unlocks the next twist of physics—so the inferred lens holds with visible price (“pledged his soul”). No orientation debt; greenhouse geography stays spatially coherent. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the button rewrites “abandoned” into “awaited,” re-weighting the entire archive’s ontology. Causal lens holds: because the dust lied, therefore Elias acts; the brass object is the hinge that retro-corrects the record. Cost is on-page—“trembling hand,” “soften slightly” paired with the risk of professional censure—so the reconfiguration is neither abstract nor sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal linkage is airtight: because the whistles fail, she must lone-walk; because the map exists in puddles, she can reach the lagoon; because the key turns, the screens blacken. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 80 words and the single shard never breaks spatial coherence. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the golden stain on her coat is the visible, lasting cost that reweights the premise—truth now literally clings to her. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; every beat tightens options until the final image reconfigures them.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prophecy is choked, the valley saved, and the price—perpetual dawn vigilance—lingers in the fading bioluminescence. Causal chain is tight: dew-cued moment → negative-space solo → lights expire. Orientation is immediate (grotto, dawn, sax). One soft spot: the machine’s “recursive algorithm” is never shown testing tectonics, so the stakes feel asserted rather than proven, a micron below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone swallowed into living wood reweights the rule “what is planted here emerges transformed” with visible cost—Silas loses unique relic and seed. Causal lens holds: hush arrives → leaf angle signals tribute → monument → prod → transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no debt. One meaningful tightening: silence collapses external wind and internal option to delay. Cost is legible in the final image—glowing leaves are both monument and memorial, no explanatory tag appended.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: three clocks → cavern → ladder failure → vine leap → compass retrieval; each because/therefore linkage tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning needle and Silas’s exhilaration reweight his former fixer identity with irreversible cost—no way back across the pool. Orientation anchors by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Only hairline slip: the cavern’s exact distance/time-to-travel is elided, but this does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the empty space where Julian vanished becomes a tangible gold lattice, reweighting the premise that “a name is a factual density.” The causal chain—coin → hyper-fluid gold → airborne filigree—obeys internal alchemical logic, and the rain/steam provide felt environmental cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“massive iron doors of the foundry”), well inside the 120-word safety window. The only hairline slip is a mild explanatory nudge (“she had succeeded…”) just before the final image; it slightly blunts the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain is clean: sour note → spectral turbulence → memory → release. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elian foregoes further engagement once Thorne lightens, and the upward-spiral image carries visible cost—the gorge’s silence is now peaceful, not oppressive. Orientation anchors by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One soft spot: the tooth’s prior whereabouts arrive as exposition, not earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mask removal + ultraviolet overload reweights mercy from absence to symmetrical distribution, cost legible in seared lungs and expanded skeleton-forest map. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural—each trauma-flinch tightens the texture until the singularity. No orientation debt; who-where-when is anchored by word 30. Only hairline slip: “mathematics of mercy” is named early but not tested in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal chain is immaculate: soot-black canvas → lens fragment → revealed tragedy → unfastening → memory spoken → painting bled dry. Orientation is anchored in three lines (who, where, when) and the single-scene default is honored; the lighthouse storm is an embedded shard, not a second scene. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s archive is silently contradicted, the keeper’s name enters the living record, and Elian’s body registers the price (“a heavy, solemn burden”). Persistent constraint—his emptied canvas and cooling lens—reconfigures future options, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: dropped mainspring → jammed clockwork → frozen lift → ghosts vigil → Elias frees it. Closure is the mournful groan and descending ceiling: a Decisive Change that pays off the “what ceilings hide” promise while dispersing the spirits. Orientation is clean by 120 words; space, era, and stakes legible. The jammed cog is both literal and metaphorical break in façade, repricing the circus illusion with conceptual cost as the dark drops toward Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each beat is a because/therefore link (find frost → distil whisper → print contradiction → world tears). Closure is a decisive, irreversible change—library dies, Silas dies with it—charged by the conceptual cost of “solid consequence.” No orientation debt; world rules taught through action. Cost is unmistakable in the final image of him falling among shards.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the storm-projection rewrites ambient time, Thorne’s data corrupted, Elian’s dream forced onto reality—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because he covers mirrors and angles the shard, therefore the chronal refraction reconfigures the room’s meaning. One minor elasticity: the shard’s exact chronal properties aren’t seeded before the storm, but the image pays off the lens so cleanly the gap is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: because he clings to perfectability, therefore the machine remembers its unbroken state. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the harmonic wave knocks dust from rafters and from Elias’s own doubt. Orientation anchored in first 60 words; no teleporting props. The persistent price: the stone’s light now owns the city’s lung, binding Elias to perpetual honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the harvested “breath of the impossible” reweights the industrial world Silas must return to, cost felt in the tremble. Causal chain—compass → psychometry → fissure → drop of storm → hinge opening—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (factory whistle, valley, rebreather). One transition (surface → descent) is clean. Lens is Causal; every beat narrows option toward the single fissure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: because the GPS era is dead, therefore a 19th-c. slide can save a ship; because Elara clings to “timewoven alliances,” therefore she sacrifices her sculpture. Each beat tightens options—radio plea → slide retrieval → sculpture demolition → beam alignment—ending in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the generator’s drone re-enters her body, now freighted with the cost of permanent vigilance. Orientation locked by word 40; no prop or knowledge teleport. Closure image (lights fading into grey) carries undeniable conceptual cost: the alliance holds, but the ocean stays lethal.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the UV-vein map reweights her entire artistic premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the “lighthouse for the lost” image makes the conceptual cost undeniable. Causality is intact—cathedral glass imperfection → visible pulse → paint shift—but the single beat tightening is micro, not a reversal, so it stops just short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (letters → lagoon → cipher trade) is linked by because/therefore logic. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—obsidian solidifies, diary gains real weight—visible cost on page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 40, well inside the 120-word allowance. One minor ellipsis: the “encrypted diary” is introduced as already in her hand before we know she found it in the letters, a tiny teleport, but it does not break the final linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amber bottle absorbs the entire civilization-simulation in a single, legible Decisive Change that will overwrite the silence; cost is the palpable flaying of her working memory. Causal linkage holds: because the town chose ease→erasure, therefore Elara reverses by bottle-birth, paying with biological overload. Orientation is clear by line 3; only minor waver is “decades ago” left hanging without anchoring date cue, but the payoff at closure makes it functional.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the architect’s metaphor becomes literal tower death-knell, reweighting the city’s lifespan with undeniable cost. Causal chain is lean—silence → find → immerse → hear → understand → record end—but intact under the Accumulative lens; each beat thickens dread rather than flips plot. The 3rd-grade memory arrives as motivated ellipsis that pays off immediately, not expository dump. One hairline wobble: “tower’s time had officially run out” edges toward editorial summary, but the prior image of dissolving wax keeps the cost on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory grain of ice/light reweights the stake until the flattened vortex pane delivers Conceptual Repricing—stolen time feels gritty. Closure lands with undeniable cost: “a moment that shouldn’t exist” is both prize and sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds: because he tracked the anomaly and the glue is now hard, therefore he can—and must—choose silence; the capacitor whine’s dying note is the audible proof of cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the decisive change is the kill-switch throw that downs the siren and revalues his job. Closure is crystalline: the rope pendulum marking “a time of peace” re-weights every prior mechanical cue into a moral stance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—each meteor is a textural pulse that layers density until the final flare reconfigures meaning. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s silence becomes “a flourishing stillness,” reweighting the premise that stillness = emptiness. Cost is legible in the final line—“the willingness to burn” is now an internalized constraint that will shape every future sweep. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are clear within the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box’s violet light reweights the covenant, making silence itself the costly prize. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of return, light shift, and ghost stillness builds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (scorched horizon / apiary ruin). Persistent constraint: nightly ritual must be repeated; the knot can never stay tied. Cost is unmistakable in the final beat—“fresh, recurring wonder” carries the fatigue of eternal vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the urn fragment freezes the silo’s mutations, reweighting Elara’s timeline with abrasive ash as the new constant. Causal chain intact—garage-sale signal → capsule retrieval → shard contact → stillness—each step narrows options. Orientation anchor (“apex of the Emerald Silo”) arrives at word 9; no penalty. Cost is legible in the slowed borrowed-time pulse and the pocketed shard’s perpetual cut.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the red kite remains a “majestic flaw,” reweighting the weave and leaving the cobalt mirror as conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each stroke layers texture until the final image crystallizes the asymmetry. Causality is internal and coherent: because Elian values incompleteness, he refuses to restore perfect harmony. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are vivid by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Causal: every beat is abecause/therefore linkage—because the pillars crush roots, therefore Silas coils copper; because the coils conduct piezoelectric hum, therefore the oaks redirect upward. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple shifts from geological immune system to symbiotic battery, and Silas’s fading heartbeat is re-tuned to the stone’s pulse. Cost is legible in the final line—“offering a final gesture of interspecies respect”—the price is his life, paid on-page. Orientation is anchored within 30 words (jagged stairs, temple orchard, living stone pillars); no teleporting props or convenient knowledge leaps appear.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal string holds: spring rain ends → footprints spark recognition → meeting Aris confirms theory → amber toss = Decisive Change with felt cost. Closure image (amber shattering below) reweights “home” as exploitable weakness; cost is visible, audible. No lens ambiguity. Orientation anchored by line 4. Meets 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage is tight: because Silas speaks dead languages, therefore he deciphers the tern’s cadence; because the cadence pinpoints the veil, therefore the pods sink and trigger bioluminescent kelp. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 4; no penalty. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the mournful three-note shriek marks the instant pods must be cast—options narrow from “search” to “throw now.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the grey ocean reconfigures into living emerald, undeniable conceptual cost paid by the reef’s rebirth while the coachman rides back into darkness. One hairline slip: the phrase “submerged concord” is named but never tested or threatened; it lands cleanly nonetheless.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The plot is a pure causal ladder: find cylinder → decrypt visually → leaf key → radio coordinate → collapsed distance. Each step is a because/therefore linkage triggered by Silas’s prior skills and shared lover’s code; no off-stage shortcuts. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the wasteland is still dead, but silence is now “pregnant” with a living voice—an unmistakable on-page reconfiguration of stakes. The cost is the irrevocable exposure of his hope; once tuned to that frequency, he can never return to the safety of mere survival.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass redefined from talisman to explorer’s badge, with the cost—permanent exile—felt in the “quiet concentration of a cartographer at the edge of the world.” Causal linkage holds: because she stays, she survives; because she survives, she re-sees the sky; because she re-sees, she recommits. One micro-turn (chaos → legible topography) tightens stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and reinforced by jacket cue.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: violet sky → brass test → piece-swap sequence → ward-melt. Orientation anchors (spire, frost, parapet) arrive within 60 words; no penalty. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: “stolen lock” re-prices safety itself. The lens stays Causal throughout; only the thinnest margin short of 9+ because the cost is cosmic, not personal—felt, but not yet paid by Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each walked letter adds density until the dust-text becomes a palpable gravestone. Closure is a Charged Poise—the sunbeam exposes the walked prayers, crystallizing the archive with undeniable conceptual cost: the pawns are forever absent. Causality intact: the kings’ clack actively unbinds the sonic knot, permitting the Penumbra’s departure. Orientation anchored by line 3; no prop or knowledge teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: distorted reflection → find stone → tactile quill → unlock cipher → seed stone → golden roots lock shelves. Each because/therefore tightens options until the mountain’s heartbeat crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration: home becomes self-grown jail/garden. Cost is the burial of her last escapist exit—felt in the trembling glass she finally lowers.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: because he once weaponised strategy, therefore he freezes the board, therefore he must sacrifice stasis to restart time—cost registered in the snapped ozone thread and the first audible splash. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt price; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is unmistakable: the forged hush shatters, the spire is forced to hold polyphonic truths, and Kaelen stands ready for punishment—an Earned Stasis with visible cost. Causality holds: because he speaks, the canyon’s acoustic rule refracts, forcing villagers and elders to confront complexity. The lens is Causal: every stanza tightens options for both protag and community. Orientation is supplied early (“Canyon of Endless Echoes… before the ritual”), satisfying the 120-word anchor test.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first groan of collapsing pontoons to final golden ripple. Each sensory fragment (ozone, mentor’s laughter, rust) layers like gilt until the statue’s glow reweights the entire workshop into a preserved moment. Closure delivers CR: the gold is not metal but “resilience of the soul witnessing its own end,” a conceptual repricing that revalues damage itself. Persistent constraint—no surface, no air—shapes every tactic and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell’s descent re-prices memory—keeping means letting go—and the cost is felt in the widening smile magnified by the pool. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fracturing (mirror, wrong turn, cracked echo) accumulates until the single beam of light reweights the stake. Causality holds because the missed marker is a believable grief-distortion; the wrong turn mechanically enables discovery yet the emotional beat is the reconfiguration, not coincidence rescue. Orientation is clean (who/where/when inside 120 words: “Elias sat upon the weathered pilings…”) and the final image crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: storm → ship blind → horn dead → vial whisper → course corrected. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Atlantic still swells but the moral physics of rescue has been permanently redefined by scent instead of sound. One micro-turn (keeper defeated by mechanical failure) seeds the vacuum Elias fills. Slight lens wobble: “vibrations of intent” flirt with Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending lands cleanly under Causal because the ship literally turns.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer (ozone, incense, copper heat) intensifies until the bronze foot glows, reweighting the stake from mechanical failure to spiritual conduit. Closure is a Charged Poise: dish aligned, corridor held, ghosts home, Elara left clutching the cooling relic—cost felt in her slumped exhale. One micro-turn at midpoint—circuit completes, metal burns—deepens pattern. No causality break; ellipse of dead phone line tightens cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens: because the virus erodes boundaries, therefore Elias pursues occlusion; because rational pharmacopeia fails, therefore he turns to discredited texts; because the glass eye ritual quiets the chorus, therefore he can lie—each linkage tightens options with visible stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (who/where/when in hanging orchard). Closure is a crisp RR: the hush after his test-lie crystallizes new privacy; the cost is the fragile, probably temporary nature of the fix, felt in the sweet-truffle silence. No causal breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the Edelweiss re-weights the lighthouse’s purpose from guiding ships to illuminating “the vast, quiet spaces between people.” The causal chain—flower → memory → decoded sacrifice → redefinition of keeper’s vocation—lands with visible cost: Silas’s gasp, the violent mist, the tower’s lonely gear. Orientation is nailed by line 3. Lens stays situational-accumulative; each sensory detail adds density until the final image reconfigures meaning. No caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is a therefore/because linkage—ants → fissure → matrix → portal—escalating water and narrowing options. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: he steps into the shop-call moment, sealing grief-map forever; cost is visible in the rising flood he accepts. No teleport props or retro patches. One micro-soft spot: “he realized…” sentence tells the epiphany just after the physical threshold; a half-line sooner inside the motion would have nailed inevitability perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Isolde sits inside the ember grotto while cosmic wounds still drip overhead—summer’s fragile shield vs. annihilation is legible and irreversible. Causal chain holds: climb → starlight contact → firefly ignition → mantle assumption. Orientation anchor (limestone ledge, final bell) arrives before word 120. Persistent constraint: skin-numbing cold that will not abate coats every subsequent move.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the marble-sun reweights the value of “now” and friendship with undeniable cost. The causal chain holds—Kaelen’s whisper is the exact catalyst that stabilizes the vortex—so lens is Causal and intact. Persistent constraint: Kaelen leaves with the star, foreclosing reunion. Cost is visible in the “hollow in his chest” line.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ambiguous-lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by the scroll-to-dream-to-scroll loop; the Charged Poise lands on-page as the charcoal “scratches” the dream into contested existence—cost felt, timeline still broken. Orientation is secure inside the cabin by ~100 words; causality holds under dream-logic rules.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clock’s new heartbeat and Kael’s single nod reconfigure the shop’s emotional economy with felt cost—Elias’s perpetual sensory exile. Causal lens holds throughout: screw → valve → rhythm → nod, each step a because/therefore. Anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 4; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nursery rhyme rewrites her body’s law, turning geological doom into narrative skin. Lens is Situational—pressure forces stance crystallization; coincidence (storm timing) complicates but does not resolve. Causality is tight: held breath → time freeze → ink on quartz → molting. Persistent constraint: she now bears inked, tender flesh where armor was—cost is visible and tactile in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Silas needs the pre-chainsaw hush to pressure the supernatural, therefore he times the ritual; because the apology is corrupted by resentment, the burn manifests; because the field collapses, the spirit snaps back and the hush shatters. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are locked by line 4; the Chevalier Archive’s spatial logic remains coherent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bottle is empty, the orchard roars, and Silas walks into “the debris of the morning”—a crystallized image where the cost (no clean absolution, world moving to ruin) is undeniable. No causal breaks, no convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the erratic walking stitches reality, and the dictionary definition pays off as a conceptual re-pricing with visible cosmic cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of footsteps and definitions tightening until meaning re-weights chaos. Orientation is taught by disorientation (geometry, flowers for stars) and waives the 120-word anchor rule because the payoff redeems the initial vertigo.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: density of water vs. gear imagery tightens until the pattern breaks into “screaming friction.” The closure is a crisp Charged Poise—key clatters, fluid illusion rushes back, leaving the containment insight legible and irreversible. Cost is line-locked: “he was caught in its teeth.” Orientation anchors by line 3; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the curtain sighs open, air mixes, and the laser-grid shutdown is the visible, irreversible cost that forever fuses their previously separate spaces—no reset possible. Causal chain holds throughout: spatial gift → spore leakage → obsession with permeability → laser override → curtain fall; every step is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is rock-solid by line 3; bioluminescent farm, graveyard shift, magnetic seals all anchor without exposition dump. The final image reweights the premise: control is now surrendered, not enforced, and the price (loss of absolute boundary) is legible in the shared breath of spores.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the impossible library reweights her life-equation, cost felt in the quiet surrender to rain that never wets. Causal lens holds: graffiti vector → platform that should not exist → lantern-stabilized text → acceptance of mortality. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (no station on map) and pays off at exit. Persistent constraint—her stented heart—shapes the final image of dry rain, an unbreachable contradiction she now embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the dissonant chord severs the loop and the operator sits in “pregnant” silence, cost felt. Causal chain is thin—why this pitch shatters that grief is asserted magic—but at this length one crystallizing beat suffices; orientation holds early.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice is immaculate: each physical nudge (tilt stone → divert trickle → mix ink) cascades into metaphysical payoff, proving “proximate causes” is method, not ornament. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the laugh migrates from silver to atmosphere, revaluing memory as public climate rather than private keepsake. Cost is legible in the dropped locket—she trades ownership for stewardship, forever. Time/space anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt; lens holds from first clause to last image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single-scene causality holds: rumor → visitor → renunciation → intimacy; the moon-rock discard is a decisive change with felt cost, reweighting reciprocity from barter to shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: absolute-zero silence reweights every prior note; forgiveness is felt not spoken. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each tree-touch thickens the tactile score until pattern break in the clearing. The 120-word orientation gate is cleanly met: who (blind cartographer), where (sonic forest), when (constellation pause) all surface by line 4. Cost is visible in the ring’s burn and the final “quiet blaze” that she now carries inside.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each retro-edit is a because/therefore link whose cost is the darkness siphoned into the “law.” The ending delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—history rewritten, ozone scent signaling new possibility—with felt conceptual cost (the room’s darkness spent). Orientation is taught by line 3, well under the 120-word window; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers silent gestures, moonlight pulses, and camera clicks until silence becomes audible; closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Elias weeps because observation has rewritten the world, not because a plot puzzle is solved. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is established within the first four sentences; no debt incurred. Causality is interior but coherent: because he is forgotten, he can perform the translation ritual; each camera adjustment therefore tightens the stakes of non-capture. The final shutter-snap is the decisive change with felt cost (tears) under the accumulative pattern—no causal leaps or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is immaculate: each artistic breadcrumb is both clue and emotional test; the tapestry scrap’s thread-count match to the Rotunda banner tightens options and knowledge in one stroke. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—by recontouring the red vandalism into flames, Elara reweights the entire premise: the fire is not shame but speech. The cost is visible in the soot she refuses to wipe off, a permanent stain that forecloses return to the surface world. Orientation is achieved within 30 words, lens (Causal) is taught by the second beat and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: folded map → shortcut → early arrival → silence-opens box → sirens punish noise. Closure is a sharp Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias erases the bridge, proving his thesis while Kael is trapped by his own shout. Cost is legible in the sirens and the emptied coin pedestal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    A single causal spine—Elias weaving light to reframe her guilt—lands an Earned Stasis closure: the secret stays unspoken yet reweighted. The dental mirror’s reverse optics create a visible ‘because’ chain; each shutter click narrows her internal options until the starburst reconfigures meaning. Orientation (who/where) is anchored by line three; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is palpable: he forfeits the comfort of words, she forfeits the relief of confession—both losses etched in the drifting “artificial stars.”

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias can hear obedience’s drone, therefore he weaponizes chess hesitation; cradle act → city-wide signal → surveillance snag. Orientation anchored by word 70; no drift. Closure is Charged Poise: the mist-shrouded city now hums with questions, foreclosing zero-uncertainty rule. Cost is conceptual (ideological jam) not personal, but remains legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dissolve of the dock and the spark of gills reweight the world with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—whale-call → scrimshaw warmth → Vane lets go—but the dock’s sudden “cloud of silt” edges toward convenient dissolution rather than earned physics.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shaving of wood and flower petal adds density to the “remade hush.” Closure lands in a Charged Poise—the zero-gravity quietude—whose cost is legible in the dust pile that was once his wedding bouquet. Orientation anchors by line 3; no因果 ambiguity. One tight escalation: the bouquet’s gradual disintegration reweights the stake from ‘hide grief’ to ‘erase capacity to grieve.’

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new sensory layer (cloud, quartz hum, shadow ink) tightens the stakes of perception. Orientation is anchored by word 55 (“Elara stood alone…”) and again spatially at the frozen lake/ colonnade. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sky has been poured into the atrium and she is both vessel and trespasser; the conceptual cost is undeniable. One micro-turn—touching the shadow—escalates density rather than causal plot, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the F-sharp crack reverberates from reed to quartz to canvas, reweighting Elara’s world from “broken” to “complete.” Causal linkage is iron-clad: because she is color-blind she values texture → therefore collects the bent reed → therefore can shatter crystal. Plant-arrangement negotiation teaches the non-verbal pattern early; it pays off when the Glassblower nudges moonflower aside, tightening stakes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is crisply in place by line 5; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: the beam physically hits Kael, proving past can touch present. Causal lens holds: because Elara questions her own tool, she refocuses light into touch, therefore Kael receives the laugh. Orientation anchored by word 60. No telegraphing or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the hologram lily-ghost hovering over her heart reweights both their stances with undeniable conceptual cost—love is now light, loss is now lens. Causal lattice holds: because he folds a coordinate raven → she ascends → because he compresses ash → she can breathe again; each step forecloses retreat. The ending image is not explained away; it lingers in charged stillness, satisfying the “no tidy moral” clause. One hairline slip: orientation anchors (who/when for Elias’s back-story) arrive ~140 words, just past waiver zone, but the disorientation is mild and later repaid by closure, so −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each measurement is a because/therefore step toward the engineered-demolition reveal. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“Silas stood beneath the rain-beaded skylight”). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the world’s dimensions are “artificially constrained”—and Silas’s observer stance is decisively foreclosed. No causal breaks; the tape’s snap is the pivot beat that tightens all prior inference.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because the archive weaponizes nostalgia, therefore she must dance unpredictably; because she endures, therefore the pagoda opens; because she sees, her innocence burns. The closure is a crisp Earned Stasis—she foregoes the comfort of forgetting and carries the beacon alone—priced by the scraped veil and cracked voice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian geode reframes the collective dream as shallow, with luminous regret unmistakably paid on-page (“profound, luminous regret… endless, blinding peace”). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density of botanical imagery and footage juxtaposition tightens until the final mineral absorption. Causality is clean: footage gap → shadow adrift → stone offer → metamorphose → irrevocable cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coffee-ring cartography is causally obeyed: sediment → pry bar → glowing root, a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shattered hourglass and hum reweight time and pain in one image, cost paid in blood on rubble. Orientation anchors observatory/dawn by 40 words; no drift. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the amber nebula inside the lens is an undeniable new rule-set—love is mineralized, not decayed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; density increases via sensory layering until the final cadence shift. Causality is intact—because she warms the strip, therefore the love migrates into glass. Cost is felt in the sudden silence that “feels lighter,” a tangible atmospheric debt paid.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of celestial imagery intensifies until pattern breaks at surrender; closure is Charged Poise with felt cost (“paralyzed by exhaustion yet alive”). Anchors clear by word 60; no orientation debt. One micro-turn: frantic tracing → stillness. Persistent constraint (instrument lost, body spent) shapes final image; cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical layer (silica petals, ozone ash, chiming grit) thickens the texture until the cosmic stakes feel granular. The single scene flows from dune-crest to quantum dispersion to gasping return—one continuous tightening of sensual density rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Charged Poise: the stuck midnight re-weights every prior image; the universe is safe but the guard is eternally awake—conceptual cost paid on-page. No orientation debt; who/where/when locked by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the turbine’s harmonic song re-prices the rule-set—machine and mind now share a heartbeat, making future translocations acceptable. Causal lens holds throughout: because he inserts the gear, the turbine revives, creativity pollen drifts, and his psyche unknits. Cost is legible in the exhausted slump against vibrating metal. Orientation is taught early (bronze branch, Mechanical Rainforest) and pays off at the end when the transformed wind sings through the same canopies.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the man steps off the skiff having reweighted “leash” from safety to crutch, now replaced by his own resolve. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—spiral path, deepening twilight, and star-light drops re-stake meaning until the final crystallizing grab. Causality is soft (no because/therefore chain) but the pattern is taught early and holds. Cost is felt—not stated—when the lullaby fades into silence; the absence of sound becomes the price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accausal/Textural lens holds: the scarred stair and bolt accumulate pattern until the silence-premise is repriced. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“carrying the weight of the past up into the cold, blue dark”—with a felt conceptual cost: he contaminates the Keep by remembering. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity. The final image cleanly reweights every prior mute ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal chain is immaculate: pellet → ink → marginal riddle → rune → gravity severance; each step forecloses an option (Pretender can still stop reading, but doesn’t) and the final image reweights “true weight” as cosmic right. Closure lands with conceptual cost—library still dying, Orel still alone—and the lens never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: because he refuses to accept the sensor void, therefore he manually assembles sonic data, therefore he confronts the reef that ate his childhood road—closure delivered as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable ecological cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are secure by line 4; the drive lens (Causal) holds without wobble. The reef-as-road reveal is both Decisive Change and felt price: his grandfather’s map is now a relic, his own life's mission inverted.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: jammed doors → ozone reek → circle exposed → glasses align threads → barefoot conduit → resonance ignition. Closure is a sharp Decisive Change: dead frigate lives, lull broken; cost is the thunderous quiet that leaves her tear-streaked, future unwritten but reopened. No orientation drift; who-where-when locked by sentence 3. One meaningful tightening—energy streams snapping into gear—narrows options to “ignite or admit defeat.”

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because she decodes the kite, therefore the sphere opens, therefore the child awakens. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing—hope becomes weapon—with visible cost as patrol lights lock onto her triumphant surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (wind, whine, soil, photo) thickens until the final graft reweights the whole pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias’ refusal to flee crystallizes options—remain the green lung—while the conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance, storm-locked solitude) is undeniable in the last image. Causality is intact: because he polishes the pearl and binds orchid to pine, therefore he stays, foreclosing mainland escape. No orientation or artifact debt touches the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fall into black reweights the premise—canvas is now absence, not depiction—paid for with the library’s extinction. Causal lens is intact: because the world knots and the box collapses, therefore he unthreads the floor and descends. Cost is visible in the slamming walls and retinal burn. Persistent constraint—the tarot box as coffin—shapes the final image, satisfying 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: theft → pursuit → confront → ink escape; each beat narrows Silas’s options until the man literally vanishes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “time and space could be rewritten” reweights the premise and Silas’s goal with undeniable cost—he must now chase geometry, not flesh. Cost is legible in final image: tears in UV light, drone landing like a “tame bird” he never wanted. Lens holds as causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she finds the letter therefore she arms the analog bypass therefore the city wakes. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the lovers’ words now vibrate in every ear, irreversible. The final image reconfigures silence itself: “pregnant with the noise of the world waking up.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One tightening only, but it forecloses all retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dome’s “engraved quiet” becomes a portable law carried by wind-borne spores. The because/therefore chain holds: because she chooses to sheath the knife, the stranger’s tension bleeds off and the rose-generated calm begins to colonize the world outside. Causality is tight—every prior beat (Tower fall, ballast sand, whispered values) feeds the final image of a law grown from earth rather than stone. Cost is felt: she forfeits her father’s lethal legacy in full view of a potentially hostile witness.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the captured goddess-echo is pinned, constellations retreat, and the garden’s silence carries undeniable conceptual cost (“world that had forgotten how to sing”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sonic density → rupture → crystalline vacuum—taught early and held to final image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. One causal micro-turn: collision of constellations → echo exposed → spike swung. Cost is legible in the frozen diamond air and the lullaby still clawing her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is immaculate: assumption → ledger contradiction → narrative collapse → phone coup. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the clouds still drift, but the regret-orbit has been forcibly re-calc’d—cost is the permanent recalibration of her father’s legacy in her own eyes. One minor drag: the “timeframe after journalist calls” is announced rather than felt as a lived countdown; we never hear a second tick. Orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: because she finds the letters → builds the machine → traps the cry in amber, each step shrinking options and raising cost. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s new constellation-fracture makes the before/after legible and charges the final image with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One causal micro-gap: the letters’ author is never substantiated, but the glitchy firmware keeps the chain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (shard as antenna → sand map → sever knot) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until the emergent hush lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (ruined art, cold tile). Orientation is taught by the lilac mist and acoustic nexus within 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure beat—“the tile flake went cold”—pays the price and reweights the premise: order salvaged from dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is immaculate: malfunction → ghost overlays → tessera anchor → child encounter → metadata forgery → heat vent → concealed life. Each beat tightens the noose: scanner acceptance of “Cerulean Tessera” is a Decisive Change with systemic cost—if the server audits, 734 is scrap. Orientation is cinematic inside 120 words: plaza, breached sky, crystalline crunch under tread. Closure image—the tessera almost fitting the broken spiral—reweights the entire premise: mercy is an error that still completes a pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard’s perpetual spring and Clara’s smile reconfigure the stake from bankruptcy-sale to legacy-rebirth; Barnaby’s bow shows the price—eternal invisible service. Causal chain intact: because he cannot touch the coin, he refracts time itself; therefore the Tower is overlaid by the Star. Lens holds: each echo pulled forward narrows Clara’s options until she chooses reinvention. Cost is legible in the final image—ghost alone under healed static—so the performance exacts permanent solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias refuses the pill → he can guide; because Mara swallowed it → she shakes; therefore he tapes the geode and invents somatic choreography. One meaningful tightening at 3-min exposure narrows options from verbal to visceral. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—digital cathedral re-weights her “noise” into structure; cost is her tear catching the red standby light. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “interpreter of the waking” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost—she alone must speak a language no one has asked for. The accumulative lens holds: each thermal flare deepens the density of “earth beginning to heal” until the final image reconfigures meaning. The fossil’s persistent constraint shapes both tactics and the cadence of return; cost is legible in the racing synapses soothed by raised veins.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crystallized Decisive Change: the prophecy erases and the sand re-flows in chaotic spirals, reweighting the valley’s time-rule with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because he unscrambles the echo with buttons, therefore the inscription fades and the glass turns. Lens is Causal throughout; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Cost is legible in the blank cliff and the swirling sand that “defied gravity,” a persistent constraint now shaping history.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal spine holds: framed → pillbox proof → snow cipher → basket exchange → erasure. Each beat tightens because/therefore linkage; the microdot inside the pillbox is a smart causal pivot that retroactively justifies survival. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he is left alive but un-reinstated, footprints gone, cost legible. Orientation is anchored by word 75 (“Elias stood at the precipice…”), well inside the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of fog, drip cadence, and yarn-needle picking intensify until silence releases. Causality is poetic but legible: because the gutters tick, therefore wait; because the ticking stops, therefore cross. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the invisible bridge accepted at the exact moment the last drop falls, cost felt in the final white void. Orientation is swift (who, where, when by line 3); no seams break the lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pot stands “perfectly symmetrical” while the vision fades, re-weighting the premise—devotion, not repair. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light-carved clay + rising thrum intensifies texture until the final crystallizing image. Causality is intact: lantern-glass vision → gentler touch → groove carved → keeper eye-contact → acceptance. Cost is felt in the dying light and the relinquished pot, though the sentence is oblique; a hair more visceral acknowledgment would clinch 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors lock, the beam holds, and the “protected vulnerability” is felt in the still air. The rose’s drop times the mechanical turn, making the before/after legible: gardener of living plants becomes gardener of photons. Causal lattice holds: because the petal falls, sight-line clears; because corrosion is coaxed, light crosses; because Elias endures the loss, another’s darkness shrinks. Cost is on-page: the spent bloom, the seized joint that could snap, the fragile conduit he now must guard.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Elara curating “the endless volumes of the sky” re-weights the rule-set—she is no graveyard but librarian/witness, a social role with perpetual cost. Causal linkage holds: every beat (rising tide, obsidian mirror, stone hum) tightens options until stance crystallizes. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. The price is palpable in the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: each mirrored reflection thickens the texture of silence until the spiral’s placement reweights the entire field. Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirrors tilt, green and pink blossom on stone, and the thread she sought becomes the act of joining itself. Cost is visible—she loses the private relic that anchored her secret life. No causality breaks; the sculpture’s shift is prepared by humming wires and refracted light.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal lens holds: because the entities hit perigee, Elias therefore engineers destructive interference; the final silence on the quad is legible pay-off. Orientation is crisp by word 60; ley-line and perigee logic stay internally consistent. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—torches lower, lethargy replaces frenzy—so the because/therefore chain is intact. Cost is present (fried transmitter risk, town’s future vulnerability) but understated; the “hopeful” coda softens the price’s bite, keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she plays, the space mutinies; therefore she must keep playing to survive. The orientation anchors by line 5; closure is a decisive change—world awakened, her exhaustion the visible cost. The final image of her walking away while “echoes guard the silence” is a Charged Poise that reconfigures stakes. No teleporting props or soft resets; every turn is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mosaic accumulative lens holds: each layered stroke and texture repetition deepens the dominant stake—awakening communal empathy—until the final tear/ribbon fusion reconfigures meaning with visible conceptual cost (the detective’s “hardened expression crumbled”). Orientation anchors who/where by line 3, no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the image burns through the mist, undeniable, foreclosing indifference. The cost is legible in Miller’s hitched breath and the ribbon’s permanent adhesion; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: each beat obeys because/therefore logic—nail → hum → vortex → petition → lane opening. Closure is a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration: the exile reverses, but “the dread…was no longer absolute” reweights the world rule-set; the cost is the continued porous dread she must keep breathing. Orientation anchors land within 120 words: Station 42, Weeping atmosphere, unauthorized mission. No teleporting props; the shipwrecked journal, respirator, and nail states track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pixelated amnesty reweights reality and Silas accepts a buffered, forgiving world, cost felt in the low-res violet glow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of flutter-code, shard, and fiddle layers until the cadence shift. The only drag is the late reveal (≈70 % mark) that the hitchhiker was signal, not person; earlier misdirection is untelegraphed, but the payoff justifies the delay under the waiver. Orientation is clear by word 50, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because Silas recognizes predator tells → therefore he sabotages the deal with territorial markers → therefore the acquisition collapses → therefore the firm starves on its own burn. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: he forfeits the illusion of wealth but retains the instinct to survive, cost legible in “the heavy air of the railyard settle around his shoulders.” No orientation debt; time, place, POV anchored by line 3. One micro turn (deal collapses) is allowed; no second decisive change. Misses 9.0 only because the final beat could use one more causal ripple to show the price altering immediate options.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inscription language reframes from cosmic code to collective trauma map, and the telegram’s lightness is the felt cost. Causal chain holds—star rhythm → dream entry → speech → glyph stabilization—without gaps. Orientation is swift: dome, sidereal clock, telegram all appear within 60 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the star pulses synchronize with the glyphs, forcing the spoken translation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the spell shatters → vortex forms → Kaelen acts → seed eats distortion → confession released. The frozen-scream device is an on-page Decisive Change that pays off the inciting mystery with conceptual cost (lake ruined, Verrick broken). Spatial anchors arrive by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure image—the ragged echo of guilt—reweights the premise so that “what mirrors don’t show” is now audible; cost is legible in the sated vines and floating wreckage.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Causal: every beat happens because of the last—clipping → scar-link → psychic traversal → covenant flare → dust. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the path is “burned into his mind,” a permanent cognitive graft that reweights reality. Cost is legible in the final image—dust, sweat, shiver—so the reader feels the before/after. No orientation debt; cobalt glade, dusk, and root-bound woman are anchored within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice holds: because Leda traded joy, therefore Elian infiltrates; because he inlays sigils, therefore the orchard demands payment; because he surrenders certainty, therefore her joy is released—each linkage narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sap’s golden up-rush is the on-page image that reweights the orchard’s rule-set, leaving Elian in Charged Poise—alive but directionless, cost felt. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint—his permanent loss of certainty—shapes the final image and satisfies the 9+ cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is iron-clad: public shaming → need for redemption → quarry salvage → object encounter → test → violent extraction → identity pivot. Orientation (who/where/when) locked by sentence 15; the “two weeks ago” timestamp plants the juncture that still controls him. Escalation delivered in one visible price—he physically bleeds splinters while earning a non-monetary victory that forecloses the auction-house path. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the scrap’s weight against his thigh is the concrete cost of choosing silence over commerce, and the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure image—“a pulse that mimicked the rhythm of a human heart”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor is now the text, Aris the re-inscribed cuneiform. Causal chain holds: decaying orbit → seed implant → magnetic syntax restored. No orientation debt; orbit stakes are legible by line 8. One meaningful tightening: gravity lurch forces the burial choice at peak risk. Cost is unmistakable: Elian will orbit forever with a ghost he can “brush against” but never touch.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused ingot’s hum reweights the entire archive and Elian’s purpose. Causal linkage holds—because he refuses simplification, the contradiction alloy crystallizes, foreclosing the easier path of erasure. The wintersun’s stasis and receding tide function as Charged Poise, undeniable cost felt in the pneumatic spark. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, closure clean.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every seashell thickens the texture of stored grief until the pearl detonates that density into connection. The ending is a textbook Charged Poise—cost is the inspector’s forfeiture of authority and the irreversible exposure of the cave. Orientation is anchored in the first paragraph; transitions are not needed because the piece is one continuous descent. Closure reweights the premise on-page: “the only true shelter was found in the openness of another’s spirit.”

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the river’s indifferent flow reweights Elias’s guilt into “raw solace,” cost paid in the wheezing accordion and his collapse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each graffiti layer, coordinate calculation, and final discordant chord deepens density until silence becomes charged. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt applied. One minor non-closure slip: the phrase “truth he had finally dared to locate” is slightly abstract, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara escapes with fragments that re-weight her mission, the notebook ink a tangible Decisive Change. Causal chain holds—watch lag → capture → retreat—but the library’s rule-set is asserted more than tested; a single scramble fail would have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: because the violin’s preservation magic exists, therefore the seed can explosively hijack it—turns rigidity into fertile collapse. Closure is a Decisive Change + Conceptual Repricing: empire’s claim melts into living wood, territorial legitimacy literally uprooted. Cost is legible in the final image—Elian stands in a pool of slush, Empire symbolically forfeited. No teleporting props; every object (coffee, seed, violin) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Vane is dissolving faster than cells can rot → Elara must act now; because she finds the theorem-pattern → she can anchor it; because she bridges with her own life-force → the transfer completes and her body pays. Closure is a Decisive Change: the corpse greys, the gem beats—an undeniable before/after with conceptual cost (life reduced to artefact). No teleporting props; the emerald is introduced with the kit, used, and re-weighted in the final image. Orientation anchored within 60 words under the aurora-grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene causality: stubborn vine → climb → pin → scallop → release. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; grotto rules are shown through action, never dumped. The climax is the scallop cut; it is dramatized beat-for-beat, pressure equalizing “on its own terms,” and the freed soul’s brightening from gray to gold makes the cost legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s ancient hurt is washed away as she facilitates the soul’s drop—Charged Poise achieved with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal lattice is tight: mirror shard → visible boy-self → doubt → cloak acceptance → bombardment foreclosed. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“iron gallery of the breezy lighthouse at dawn”). The closure beat—Vance wrapping the Cloak tighter while fleet waits—delivers a Charged Poise that reweights his authority without expository gloss. One hairline slip: the velvet pouch appears from “western wall” without prior spatial seed, a micro-teleport, but it neither breaks causality nor dulls the cost image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: Elara withholds → Kael is forced to watch → ripples replace stone → he reweights self. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “The stone did not disappear… It became the motion” re-weights the rule-set with undeniable cost—Kael’s ego must stay sunk. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The magnetic grotto is introduced late yet functions as the trance catalyst that enables the repricing, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the exit route is re-weighted by the geometry of reflected noise, forcing the reader to feel the cost of decades lost. Causal linkage is tight—because he maps the air via the crows, therefore he can throw to intersect the old scream, so the canyon reconfigures possibility. Anchors (who/where/when) are locked by line 3 and never drift; orientation serves the final echo-payoff. The persistent constraint—“his ankles buried through centuries of dust”—shapes every tactic and is re-echoed in the final image of walking out.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: refusal of city → theft of keystone → ascent via mist walking → unstrapping pack → inserting stone → Looms stutter. Each beat tightens options; the arch’s impossibility is seeded early and paid off when the stone “sighs” into place. Closure is a Decisive Change: the city’s music halts, mana flows human-slow, and Elara’s cost is the eternal cold she now inhabits. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; the keystone’s theft is motivated and tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the violet sunrise of her vow rewires his capacity to face daylight. The causal chain is tight—key tag → cabinet → jar → color → tears → stance shift—each step contingent, no shortcuts. Accumulation lens holds; the density of drowned promises charges the final image. Cost is legible in the line “he would no longer fear the silence,” a conceptual repricing that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the last image of gathering coins crystallizes a stance whose cost is the acceptance of endless, probably futile labor. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sound, coin scatter, and backward prophecy tighten into a cadence shift rather than causal dominoes. The Orientation Test is waived: “ambered observatory” + “after the universe contracts” anchor time/space by line 3 and the withheld physics jargon later pays off when doubt peaks. Persistent constraint (amber floor eats a coin) subtly shapes the final gesture; cost is conceptual but undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because he listens → he re-aims the observatory → crystallizes fears. Each step tightens options until the atlas is blank. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the named sculptures glint as irreversible artifacts, grief reconfigured into geometry. Minor slack: the “echo of sacrifice” is declared before its mechanism (wax cylinders) is shown, a micro-delay that nicks immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is crystal: each dew-drop obeys a strict thermodynamic rhythm that fuses bronze → bell toll → geyser, satisfying closure under Causal lens. Yet the “cosmic imbalance” door never visibly swings back; the promised crushing cost is off-stage, so the Decisive Change lands without felt price on Elian, capping the score below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is pristine: drought exposes town → Elias plants photos to pre-empt scandal → final image rewrites poison myth into friendship toast. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sapphire label reframed from murder weapon to communion cup, visible in the last ray of light. Cost is felt: Elias surrenders the private truth of the shard to public healing, leaving the valley in “profound silence” that now carries communal rather than conspiratorial weight.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the warm jewel reweights the premise—matter now obeys wonder, not just law. Causal lens holds: because she abandons count-analytics for murmuration-empathy, therefore the silver flame ignites and the crystal re-forms. Time-anchor (bruised-purple sky) is fixed by word 106, satisfying Orientation Test. Cost is unmistakable—“she was no longer just a scientist”—and that identity forfeiture is persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: micro-fracture discovery → buckle swap → silent countdown → visual confirmation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the white silk bloom reweights the premise, making the cost of his vigil indelible. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3; no disorientation penalty. The beat sequence is tight, every action narrows options, and the final image is the Decisive Change with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lattice is tight: ego death → need for Duplicate → custody fight → vivification sequence; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with visceral cost—the first pulse of panic hits Kael’s dead sensors, rewriting his existential status. Orientation locked by word 30 (“granite platform…floating rock dojo”). No teleports or soft resets; Vane’s erasure is the price of rewritten history, not authorial fiat. Persistent constraint: the synthetic shell can never host the reclaimed emotion—survival is now exile.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens dominates: each beat is a because/therefore chain—storm silence → block → envelope → orthogonal incubator → bloom → business coup. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and hold. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the same bloom that threatens suburban gardeners becomes a monetized nightmare, reweighting the premise with visible opportunity cost. Persistent constraint—the unavoidable stench—shapes future tactics and is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laughter that pierces the drone reweights every prior mechanical snarl, making the tunnel a nursery for one charged breath—cost is the spent fuel and the horizontal tears. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of engine-noise + lullaby fragments accumulates until silence liquefies; the laugh is the pattern-break. Orientation (who/where) is anchored by line 4; timeframe metaphor is taught early and pays off. No causality breaks; all pulls are sequential, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared suspended breath reweights the stake from solitary exile to possible coexistence, with the “crushing geometry” still looming—undeniable conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases via recurring “frost,” “mist,” “geometry” until the final dimming reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught early (guardian, frozen garden, now) and the deliberate disorientation (mind-as-terrain) pays off inside the same scene, so no penalty. Causality is internal but coherent: “interiorizing exteriors” swallows the battlefield, forcing the guardian to confront the intruder inside its own psyche, narrowing options to speak or destroy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: every therefore is a failed experiment that feeds back into the crucible, narrowing options until only annihilation remains. The 120-word anchor is met: “Elian stood at the precipice of the Ember Nexus… twilight here was not merely a fading of light…” gives who-where-when and stakes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the future is no longer linear continuation but violent, self-heating chaos—cost is the bishop’s shaft destroyed and the alchemist’s flesh freezing in the back-blast. No teleporting props; the crozier’s gilded tears become the creature’s bloodstream, a persistent constraint that literally melts the world’s paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “recipe” re-weights the dying star from loss to genesis, with the cooled fragment in pocket as felt souvenir. Causal chain holds: perigee noise → failed protocols → discard assumption → capture hush → data. The tower-collapse risk is named but never threatens action, so the cost is mostly conceptual; hence not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the full hourglass re-prices her earlier “useless” watch, proving linear time can be mined from sheer will, but only by relinquishing the numinous stasis she mastered. Causal linkage holds—each dial-twist seeds sand, each grain tilts the grotto toward neon city light—so the re-entry lurch feels earned, not magic. Orientation lands by line 4 (who/where/when explicit), well before the 120-word mark. No late-rule patch; the sideways-clock rule set in paragraph 3 pays off at the climax when sand flows downward for the first time.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the gallery collapses into a single white erasure, Elias fused to the impossible stair he birthed—conceptual cost legible in the pain-image. Accumulative lens holds: each threaded loop tightens the hallucination’s density until the pattern ruptures under its own mass. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and re-cued spatially throughout; deliberate disorientation later pays off at rupture. No causality breaks; the paradox’s weight is earned by iterated textile micro-causality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unfolded horizons collapse, reweighting the premise—stars now mentally reachable yet physically forbidden. Causal chain holds: because he deciphers edge geometry, therefore he sees Orion, therefore he records latitudes he’ll never sail, paying with abyssal exile. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“benthic city,” “bulkhead”), waiver applies. One hairline slip: the sentence “He deactivated the simulation…” is pure function; a sharper image of light folding back into black could charge the beat further.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: the photograph’s anomaly → hearing-aid conduit → child-signal detection → shield of recognition each trigger concrete next steps. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside first 60 words). Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the bench photo gains a blurred child-figure, proving rescue and charging Elara with aftermath fatigue—felt cost on-page. A micro-turn (Arthur ≠ haunt but anchor) tightens stakes cleanly; no teleport props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: trapped scientists → need anchor → gold fleck → phase-transition Return → tide deadline → escape. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words and hold. The forty-minute tidal window supplies tangible urgency and a ticking cost. Closure is a Decisive Change: the ghosts leave, the station is abandoned, Elias ascends. The cost is felt—the hull groans, the gold fleck is left behind—but the rule-set never threatens to fail, so the stakes’ repricing is moderate, not devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ink dries, projection severs, and Elias resumes his count—an image that reweights every prior beat with the cost of irreversible isolation. Causal lattice holds throughout: because he is legally dead he can breach the server; because the shard is the fracture coordinate the table reads it; because the ink obeys physics the algorithm accepts stochastic patterns. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (iridescent observatory, dome, snow). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern—density of sensory fragments crystallizes into final stance—taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: fracture alignment → bird-pattern read → vocal transduction → curse exacts voice. Orientation is complete by line 7; every beat advances the acoustic translation goal. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: silence accepted, tactile wind legacy secured, cost (voice gone) visible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: arrowhead → phone → blood → gravity release → butterfly burst; each beat tightens options. Closure (CR) reweights the rule-set—ghost becomes laughing man—with visible price: dead phone, sliced thumb, frostbitten hope. Lens holds causal throughout; no teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: because she believes beauty must be torn free, she weaponizes a sub-audible violin frequency that the statues cannot parse; therefore the orchard answers with violent growth, collapsing the grid. Orientation (who/where) lands within 30 words; no teleporting props. Closure is a decisive change charged with cost—the sky-bridge vantage lets her watch the city literally bleed green, a visual price she cannot undo. Lens holds: every beat tightens options until the final image reweights “mechanical world” into wild ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens dominates: each step is because/therefore tied to the drones’ blind spots and the bottle’s volatility. Orientation is anchored by word 52; no penalty applied. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—sliding the storm into the chute reweights the world’s broken hydropolitics and Elias’s own faith. The cost is legible in the ozone-tasting air and his cracked knees; no outline-like sequencing or teleported information appears.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the halo-light seals inside the horse, bell expires, new voice born—cost is the seared hand and forever-broken silence. Causality is accumulative/textural: every lyrical pass thickens the silence/light tension until the song ruptures it. The wrong-turn oasis is pure situational gift, not earned, but it complicates rather than resolves, so the lens holds. Orientation is taught by sound/mist cues within 120 words; spatial drift inside train cars is intentionally dreamlike and paid off by the final golden twilight that replaces the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the failed breach snaps shut, leaving Elara in earned stasis—she now knows the abyss exists but must shelve it. Cost is legible in the ozone-to-dust tonal shift and her resolute return to stamping books; causality holds under Accumulative lens as the scarf’s accumulated memories buckle space. Hyperbolic pleats are taught early and paid off at collapse, satisfying pattern. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the dream-city’s brief solidity then dissolution reconfigures her ache from private torment to public beauty, cost paid in the spent sunrise and empty palette. Causal chain (dream-loss → light-harvest → construct → unravel → relief) is tight, each beat altering her options. Lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of light/loss accrues until the pattern break of dispersal reweights stakes. No orientation debt; islands’ whisper taught early and serve the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ribbon, now “a mere strip of silk,” reweights the premise in one image, and the melody spiraling away makes the conceptual cost—her former identity atomized—undeniable. Causal linkage is pristine: star-hint → disorientation → centrifugal ungrounding → ribbon-fray → sonic release; every step deletes a prior option. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“Silas stood at the edge of the Shadowed Nexus”) and the cosmos-fold rule is taught early enough to waive any penalty. The single drive lens (Situational—stance crystallization under cosmic pressure) holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: Atlantic drift → wrecks rotate → Pleiades light hits soil → mushroom key surfaces → memory restored. Each step is a because/therefore linkage locked to the dome’s physics. The stolen-voice set-up pays off in the instant the glass “shatters” into the past, delivering a Decisive Change with audible cost—her laugh returns mid-sentence. Only micro-slip: the “rare celestial and tidal event” is asserted, not foreshadowed, so the timing feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lattice is immaculate: tea-leaf geometry → fracture map → Lenore’s strike → shatter. Each annotation weakens the prison it pretends to strengthen, tightening stakes under a single reversible-exile rule. Closure lands with visible cost—glass shards on the floor and the broom Silas thrusts to hide pride—earning Resonant Reconfiguration. No orientation drift; who-where-when is anchored by line 3 and never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dispersed dream reweights the lower realm’s reality, with the felt cost Elian’s solitary exhaustion. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal; the pattern is taught early and holds. The orientation test is waived: deliberate disorientation (void waterfall, dimension grafting) pays off in the final image. One transition (parapet → city) is legible; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: each unraveled knot → denser silence → quieter mask. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the needle clatters, starlight freezes, Elian’s heart becomes war-drum. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; prism sanctuary grounds optical logic that later pays off in frozen starlight. No telegraphing or plot amnesia; theft secret is revealed precisely when it re-weights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: the 1920s film → locates lost lever → Elara’s empathic push → spiral opens, each step a because/therefore link. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the chapel’s “breath of stale, incensed air” rises to meet her, making the trespass visceral. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. Persistent constraint: the rain-erased pigment can never be restored, leaving future access vulnerable—price is legible on final line.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of density increase inside the library, cadence shift when the globe’s vortex slows, closure via Charged Poise as the silence lightens. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“submersible navigated…”), no drift. The one deepening—threads dissolve after globe is touched—reweights stakes and is legible on-page. Cost is felt in the “oppressive weight lifting,” satisfying 9+ test though not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the upload reweights Kaelen’s static into music, the price is Elian’s soaked solitude and the bolt plate’s residual heat—cost is palpable in two lines. Causal chain is airtight: aerosol → mural → iron plate → lightning strike → discharge → buffer purge. Orientation taught by 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal chain is pristine: desire to recover hidden joy → cipher diary as obstacle → goggles as tool → scatter-light decoding → discovery of stratospheric love → renunciation of disclosure (he seals the diary and steps into solarium). Orientation anchored by word 60; every floor passed is a because/therefore tightening; the tenth-floor arrival forces the final stance with undeniable conceptual cost—he will leave the family ignorant. Closure is a CR that re-weights the entire premise: happiness was always present aloft, not ashore.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the looped summer day proves “empty spaces remember,” reweighting Elian’s drift into stewardship. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each cloud image layers psychic density until the memory storm ruptures. The Orientation Test is waived: delayed anchoring (who/where/when) is deliberate and pays off when the gondola’s isolation mirrors the cosmic library. Cost is legible in the final line—“waiting for someone with a telescope and enough sorrow”—a charged poise that forecloses rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: because he is face-blind → he stays → he must finish the ceiling → he needs the hidden pattern → he finds the coin → translates it by touch → paints the sky → accepts impermanence. Anchor (who/where/when) lands within 60 words; no orientation debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: he sits, eyes closed, foreclosing escape so the art can exist for one breath. Cost is legible—“the perfection of the work was bound to the fragility of its medium”—and reweights the premise. Minor slack: demolition clock is external, not a choice he can alter, so agency is reactive, not proactive.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the hovering sphere reconfigures meaning and stakes, the cost is the instant dissolution of the light she can never recapture. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern (dog-ear, hopscotch, birds) tighten until the anomaly manifests. Every beat obeys because/therefore: folds lead to grid, grid to vibration, vibration to sphere. Causal chain remains legible, final image carries unmistakable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is rock-solid: because the moon is jammed → she enters → mirrors test → she acts → wheel turns → moon slides. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with felt cost: the “gentle clinking” lullaby signals spent stamina and foreclosed options. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“obsidian peaks…Spire”), well inside the 120-word window. One minor nip: the prophecy scraps are mentioned late and off-stage, so the schematic discovery feels slightly convenient, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the thickened nebula sealed by communal action reconfigures survival itself, price paid in the bruised-purple twilight and the boot-felt thrum. Causal chain holds—chalk diagram → bell resonance → butterfly amplification—without off-stage magic. Lens stays accumulative/textural; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pane shatters, Silas dissolves, and the lullaby is released as a spectrum of emotion into the void—an undeniable conceptual repricing with visible cost (his body, the lighthouse, the puppet). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each phrasal layer (evaporated ocean, pane of hush, nested fractal pulses) intensifies texture until the cadence itself becomes the stakes. Orientation is immediate—lighthouse apex, dusk, last adjuster—within 30 words, waiving any penalty. No causality breaks; every beat elongates the texture rather than advancing plot, exactly fitting the lyric design. The only microscopic slip is a single adverb-heavy clause (“bruised awe”) that momentarily abstracts the final sensation, but it is soaked up by the surrounding image density and does not blunt the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is airtight: frost clock → vent assembly → avian override → path split. The Orientation Test is passed by word 50; we are oriented in space, time, and threat. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the birds fall, the path opens, the labyrinth seals, and Silas is left with the orchard’s rattling demand for his return—cost visible in his trembling hand. The nut’s blueprint is the only MacGuffin rule introduced, and its payoff is on-stage; no late cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the molecular “eddy” idea re-weights every prior patent and the marriage grief in one image of vanishing foam. Causal lens holds: because he watches foam diverge, therefore he re-imagines chain scission, therefore he crushes the chrysalis and turns downslope—each beat forecloses the last. Cost is legible in the haptic destruction of the golden husk and the implied decades of waste that can’t be recalled.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is immaculate: demonstration → proof of craft → arrival of first customer whose oblivion will fund the next dig toward genesis. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the customer’s erasure is revalued as Elian’s map-making, the bell-ring reframing the entire preceding ritual as cartography rather than mercy. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props; lens (Causal) taught by the scale-tipping and held to the final smile. Cost legible in the conditional shimmer of the “glimmering parole” that closes the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coral dulled, fortress atmosphere lightened, Elara’s exhalation carries visible cost. Causal lens holds—each “therefore” from tide pool analysis → dig → taste → transmutation tightens stakes; no leaky set-ups or teleporting props. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) nailed within first 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: because the silos hoard → Elara hooks the pinecone to slow time → therefore she can weave languages → elevators listen → harmony restored. The pinecone’s removal restores natural tempo, a legible Decisive Change with felt cost (her heaving chest). Orientation is secured by line 3; no lens drift. Closure is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cracked mirror redefines her from engineer to vessel, and the cost—permanent neural rewiring, bodily vibration—is legible in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sensory density and image accretion rather than causal reversals; the lens is taught early (“silver scar,” “static of a billion sleeping minds”) and holds to the end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clean by line 3. One minor scaffold artifact—“trembling nights” followed immediately by “trembling in her hands” in the last sentence—dulls the cadence slightly but does not touch the closure image; still, it prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the golden inferno of renewed vigilance ignites overhead while true gravity reclaims her body—felt cost is the jarring landing and the irreversible shift of protective fire now “unseen but ever-present.” Causal chain holds: doodle → 4-D gesture → wall dissolves → seeds reignited. The inversion hour’s ticking chronometer supplies a taught temporal pattern that tightens every beat; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens the silence until the porcelain bridge forces a pattern-break. Causality holds: the hedgehog cue → analysis of cracked ash → surrender technique → ceramic bridge → strum → resonant moan, each step a visible therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the alder’s moan reweights every prior silence, and the cost is felt in Elian’s collapse and the birds’ terrified flight—no exposition needed. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props; the single transition (clearing → bench) is legible; all caps met.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “elegant endgame” rewrites exile from shame to necessary square, with felt cost in the final renunciation. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative: nightly returns + silence-mapping → epiphany → chosen marooning; each beat layers pattern rather than forcing plot reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) locked by line 3; no disorientation debt. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via repetition of ritual and holds to final charged poise. Persistent constraint—lifetime exile—shapes tactics and final image; cost is legible in “content to remain the silent guardian.”

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and elegant: because Elias refuses violence, he must locate the emotional frequency of the clasp; therefore he cycles oscillators until the lock “sighs” open. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s exhale and the simultaneous crimson bloom overhead reconfigure the stakes—silence is now catalogued, regret forgiven, and the festival’s violence of color accepted. Cost is legible in the single beat of withheld fireworks: Elias stands alone while the city celebrates, his empathic labor complete but socially invisible. The lens holds without ambiguity, though the piece stops short of a persistent constraint that would shape future choices, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the stillness she sought is redefined as participative cyclical motion; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early, held to the final wrapping-paper image, and carries felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: Flux anomaly → water ribbons → Echo amphitheatre → arrow twist → broadcast song. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the sapling erupts, gravity re-rights, Elara falls with the returning water—an image that pays for the discovery. Orientation anchors within 120 words; the lens stays situational-pressure throughout. One minor soft spot: the off-page "hour" limit is declared, not tracked on the clock, but the beat still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is lucid: survey → map → foresee next crash. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her data will reweight the skies for the next pilot; the scorched patch supplies felt cost. Minor waiver: orientation is complete by word 70, lens holds throughout; one beat of micro-telling at the ladder could be tighter, stopping just short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is tight: aurora intensifies → bell must ring → artist strikes → prism-song released → confidence seeded. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush rebuilds itself, proving the bell-ringer’s lifelong solitude has social utility; cost is the fresh weight of silence he must re-inhabit. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. The single-scene default is met; transition-free accumulative design holds.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: because the seals failed, he returns; because he arranges the driftwood, the flute’s resonance can be steered; because he plays, he sees the canal truth. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—‘he should have built a canal’—with the hollow peace as felt cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: halo fragment → press → empathy transfer → data harvest. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: “equation remains unsolved” reweights the entire experiment, leaving Operator immortal by theft and Kael erased—felt cost on the page. Orientation anchor (“translucent topaz” room, Kael in chair) lands by word 24, waiving any disorientation penalty. Single-scene default met; no prop teleport or timeline error.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single causal lens: because Kaelen is gone Elara must act; therefore she climbs and vibrates the aurora to crack the pendant. Each beat advances knowledge or stakes; orientation anchored by word 64; closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost as her exhaustion and the vanished pendant foreclose return to courier anonymity. No causal gaps—missing mentor pushes rather than excuses action, and the dilation of time integrates rather than breaks continuity. Cost legible in final beat: “she fell to her knees, exhausted but strangely steady.”

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is immaculate: the frost-pattern revealed as emotional record reweights Mara’s 20-year memory—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social/psychic cost. Causal chain is spare yet complete: prism-on-frost (cause) → shifted hush (effect) → silhouette re-pattern (revelation) → tearful reframe (cost). Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Slight deduction because Elias’s personal price is only implicit—he is gratified, not imperilled—so the cost is felt more by Mara than operator, nudging this just under 9.0 for full universal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the loom’s square of cardboard borders and amber light sails outward, re-weighting the rule-set—memory now has a physical edge the silence cannot swallow. Causal chain is tight: jigsaw edges → loom frame → sacrificed life → message launched. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and again at “gray dusk,” well inside the 120-word window. The lens is Causal throughout; every beat is a because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because the planet fractures, therefore Ewan acts; because he barters the perfect lie, the core re-ignites. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and again at the shaft lip within 120 words. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the azure light reweights the premise—magic founded on illusion can stabilize reality—while the felt cost is Ewan’s lifelong anonymity. Persistent constraint: the silk is gone forever, foreclosing future tricks.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds throughout: shard anchors → trance dive → brother’s audible warning → forcing pan back to control room → detonation order. The Decisive Change lands on-page: she learns the mercy-lie was necessary, and that knowledge bleeds her palm—felt cost. Orientation is locked in the first 60 words; the abandoned bay and cyclical rifts are taught without ambiguity. Closure reweights every prior beat; no causal leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: lamp fails ∴ psychological plunge ∴ Elias ascends ∴ sea-glass corrects cairn ∴ amber bloom re-weights darkness. Each beat narrows options toward the final image where safety is bottled and decanted. The closure—Charged Poise in the glowing stone—carries felt cost: Elias exits into blackness having spent his found talisman. Orientation is anchored by the third sentence; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the green shadow stamps the sky, reconfiguring the city’s morning with undeniable conceptual cost—“forcing the people to remember the dark to appreciate the light.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable. The only causal gap: how the stellar beam “steers” a hurricane is hand-waved, but the piece teaches its mythic register early, so the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because he calculates sun angle → therefore submerges wing → decisive change blooms. Closure lands with conceptual cost—he reframes life as prism, not sponge. Mid-point orientation is clean; floating-tea-house rules taught early. Sun-trail chalk lines keep causality visible, payoff reconfigures premise.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the healed hedge thrums with secret history, reweighting Elias’s labour into quiet revelation. Causal chain intact—pin-drop timing triggers sextant twist → sorrow shatter → moonlight stitch. Orientation anchored inside 120 words; lens held (Causal). Cost is visible in the hush that follows the tear; no narrative amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: because she is the last weaver, therefore she sings, therefore the sap rises, therefore the sun is loomed and finally flung. The swaddle→thrust sequence is the decisive change with unmistakable cost: her palms blister, her memories “burn through.” Closure lands on the image of the lattice sky—an earned, irreversible reconfiguration of the world rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the library rewrites his exile as mastery, cost legible in the bodily feel of the “blanket” of silence. Causal chain holds: mistaken invitation → self-erasure → arrival; each step shrinks options. The luminous fern/fruit image reprises and reweights the opening commuter pulse. No teleporting props or logic drift; midpoint teaches the paradox pattern; final line lands the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fading→reclamation→communion tightens through sensory density (color drain → invasive green → steam scent). Closure is Charged Poise: the final swallow reweights the city’s graying as inevitable yet personally refused; cost is instantly felt—“the guilt…lifted slightly…wouldn’t last.” Orientation anchor secure by line 3; no teleport props; transitions clean.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the vows are gone, yet the data survives, and the iron seal makes the loss legible. Causal chain—slide decay → measurement race → verification → archival lock—is tight; no off-stage shortcuts. The “quartz hush” frame holds from first sentence to last, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is present in the snapped light and pluming breath, so the 9+ quick test is met.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: itch-feint → reset murder rhythm → sunrise deadline → lunge → vial snap; the truce-of-hush rule is taught early and pays off when Kael’s snarl breaks it, giving a clean Decisive Change with audible cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty space between weather-carriers becomes the new magnetic pole, re-weighting the entire premise. Causal linkage holds—every westward drift is punished by taste, every compass twitch foreshadows the ballot’s outcome. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (vote-frequency, ionized taste, aurora-lavender overlay) tightens until the ecosystem drafts Elara herself. Cost is unmistakable: her glow gutters as personal weather condenses—an image that can only exist after the prior data-stream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because he cannot forget humiliation → therefore flees → because silence finally arrives → therefore shatters lock → therefore paints → therefore buries lock beneath the portrait, reweighting his identity. Orientation is anchored by word 28 (“subterranean crystal cave”) and never wavers; transitions are clean. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the quartz-lit portrait physically fuses pain and beauty, foreclosing return to tourist caricatures; cost is the irreversible burial of the lock shards. Timeframe is simple continuous scene; no prop or motive teleportation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens: each lie literally curls her skin, therefore she keeps digging; the map fragment leads to the clerk, therefore the plate is handed over. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—she pivots from decorative gilding to guerrilla truth—paid for by the violent somatic tax we’ve seen twice. No orientation drift; space/time anchors land inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a sharp Conceptual Repricing: the melting ice shifts sculpture weight, releasing a roar that reweights the world’s emotional rule-set; the cost is the ice itself—finite, irreplaceable, gone by sunset. Causal lens holds throughout: every kinetic turn is because/therefore from sunrise → melt → lever strike → sound storm. Orientation is anchored within 60 words and never drifts; the bluff, clouds, and dawn rays are spatially tracked as the machine tilts. The final image crystallizes options: consensus shattered, Elara left bone-vibrating yet voiceless, the path of repetition foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain holds: geomagnetic threat → memory bleed → box transfer → marble compression → propulsion escape. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: before, static; after, rebooted silence, cost is the shattered dome and forfeited past. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: stories → combination → locket → legal shield; the holographic-will twist is a conceptual repricing that reweights ownership from paper to memory. Orientation is clean by 50 words; closure lands with undeniable social cost as the foreman halts. One minor loop: “terrifying composure” is told twice in the first two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the liberated AI dissolves upward, reweighting her déjà vu into completed filial sentence—cost is the salt-iron taste of inherited grief now irreversible. Causal chain holds: dice placement → dance decryption → blast doors open because her embodied fragility tricks aggressive logic. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—millions of tons of water—shapes every gesture; final image carries that pressure converted to song.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stolen crystal and remembered scent re-weight reality, making a before (weightless terror) / after (grounded return) legible at the salt flats. Causal linkage holds throughout—each gravity lurch is triggered by his progress, not coincidence. The coffee-ground compass is taught early, paid off when the ring explodes, forcing the anchor act. Orientation is clean by line 8; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is lean but intact: hostile night-sounds → cartography of silence → wing-drop → prophecy neutralized. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—the world’s options re-weighted by the velvet hush—with the wing’s disappearance carrying visible conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30, lens holds; only the lack of a second tightening beat keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: seal discovery → accusation → revelation → acceptance, each because/therefore link tightening the noose. Orientation is nailed in the first 90 words; the single rooftop scene never drifts. Closure is an Earned Stasis: Silas knowingly shoulder the lie, cost legible in the verb “to endure.” No causal breaks, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because she archives the memory (decision), therefore the simulation releases her (outcome). Closure is the stone’s inert weight—Decisive Change with conceptual cost. Resonance structures are seeded early (“garden’s hidden resonance”) and paid off in the crystallizing beat; no teleporting props. Final image reweights solitude into independence; orientation anchored by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because he once froze, therefore he now freezes himself deliberately to re-write the freeze. The iron key’s magnetic counter-resonance is taught on the page and pays off the same beat; the wax seal re-solidifies as proof of Decisive Change. Closure carries visible cost—rose thorn drinks the lie, wax cools on the new truth—so the Empire’s future is altered and Elian’s lifelong cowardice is priced at the risk of death. Orientation is clean by line 4; no teleporting props or retroactive rules.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation lands immediately—sandstone walls, starlight, midnight intrusion—well inside 120 words. Causal chain is clean: because she feeds graduated melodies, therefore the canyon yields truth-sediments, because she now holds the grafted echo, therefore she must smuggle it out. One seamless scene, no teleporting props; the shell’s rising heat literalizes escalating danger. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city will awaken to its own acoustic corpse—an undeniable conceptual cost sealed by the intake of breath.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the melted globe is repriced from debris to “testament,” lifting grief off the artifact under the candles’ flare. Accumulative lens holds: each dream cameo thickens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is clean—no late rules or teleporting props. The 0.9 is withheld only because the boy’s heroic choice is revealed summarily, not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensuous layer (whispering stone, moon-stepping, bubble lattice, firefly sphere) tightens the stake of “seeing hidden order.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the sphere forms, then dissolves, re-weighting his solitude with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; causality is pattern-build rather than because/therefore, paid off in final image. Minor slip: no persistent constraint carried beyond the instant, holding short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage holds: shredded letters → missing manual → forced intuitive calibration → restored shield. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by saving the machine he preserves the myth, yet chooses to shatter it, reweighting the rule-set with social cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening—erratic hum forcing the intuitive leap—sufficient for this length. Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a clean Conceptual Repricing: the signal abandons Silas, crystallizing his irrelevance. Causal chain holds—because he seeded disembodied voices, therefore the frequencies transfer allegiance to the living prophet. One minor orientation lag: “the rise of a prophet” is named before we see Kael act, but the later thermal-image payoff waives the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the last golden speck of sound reconfigures the loft from hovel to ballroom and leaves the future open yet irrevocably altered. Causal chain is clean—each sound ingredient is motivated by yesterday’s screech and today’s acoustics rule. Dawn’s whistle arrives exactly on cue, the wind-flute external confirmation that the ritual window is real. Cost is legible in the unwound spring and the returning silence that is “no longer empty”; no exposition explains the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: failure-to-turn key → sonic matching → absolution wave, each beat a therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—organs shaken, coat tightened against new cold—paid on the page. The key-turn obstruction is foreshadowed by psychic pressure, not retrofitted. Time/space anchors clear by 50 words; no orientation debt. Missing 9-band: the stillness lands cleanly, but the rule cost (key’s new fragility?) could be crystallized one beat longer.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: the frozen lake → viaduct conductance → lunar tide → grounding lever form a clean because/therefore chain. The Decisive Change lands with audible cost—“the sound of metal screaming”—and the bridge’s collapse is irreversible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are locked by the second sentence; no debt applied. Closure is touched by zero contradiction, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the rising water dislodges the lantern → entangled memory spike → worker death; because Elias experiences the same infrasound → he recognizes the hazard; therefore he uploads the heritage flag, breaking Halloway’s chain. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: “his own silence, not one imposed.” No orientation drift; geography and timeline stay tight inside the tunnel. Upload bar turning green is the on-page pivot that locks the consequence; the choice is irreversible within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the heart beats to the sad music, repricing Elias’s entire mission. Causal lens holds: because he sought mechanical absolution, therefore he confronts the echo of his failure. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no telegraphing or puppet moves. Only micro-drag: the woman’s discovery is internally coherent but arrives as off-stage knowledge she already possessed.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is pristine: acid-sea rot → floor collapse → launch ramp dissolving supplies the decisive change beat; arrow-notched gears provide the because/therefore linkage that converts fractal vision into lift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the un-heard bell is struck, path foreclosed—no retreat to workshop or sea. Cost is crystalline in the image of a canvas-and-brass skeleton drifting in vacuum. Orientation is taught by 50 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “archived assets” tag reweights the entire premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds: because Silas follows the numeric pattern he therefore finds the hidden partition; the patch anchors him throughout. Orientation is clean by line 5; the archive and drone are spatially stable. One meaningful tightening—overlaying the audio tracks—forces the reveal and forecloses any naive view of deletion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the shard projects the soldier’s mercy, making peace an undeniable physical fact that reweights the council’s options. Causal lens holds—every beat because/therefore links Kaelen’s orchard stance → metaph retrieval → refraction → council halt. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no prop teleporting. Cost is felt: council’s grim resolve “washes away,” ice groans cease. Slight cap: council’s prior vote is off-stage, so the decisive change is rhetorical rather than systemic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds: terminal diagnosis → archipelago → deferral → salvage → parasol find → decision to proceed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “sound” of ending is re-tuned from cataclysm to whispered residue, felt as the parasol’s weight against his sternum. Cost is legible in the single sentence “ready now to make the short journey,” which forecloses the fold in patience. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and never drift; transitions are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: Elias sits because he is compelled to explain, the metaphor is offered, accepted, and the letter is released—clear therefore chain. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: letter drifts away, winter will not “take this one,” cost is the night cold now bearable. Stakes narrow from existential grief to manageable solitude; no off-stage shortcuts or resets. Orientation anchors (vineyard station, harvest moon) are present by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the Pavilion falls silent, the desert re-buries itself, and Elian walks away having permanently hidden the archive; the cost is the now-unreachable wisdom and the solitude he must carry. Causality holds: because he fears erasure, he endangers himself; because he speaks the fear aloud, the Pavilion grants access; because he completes the ritual, the memory sleeps. The lens is Situational—pressure forces stance crystallization rather than causal dominoes—and the final image reweights the premise. Minor waiver: the kinetic parapet’s threat is declared rather than tested, so the escalation is more atmospheric than consequential, but this does not rupture the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (scent, rust, bloom, arc) thickens until the ruins soften into sculpture, producing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition (sunset → moonrise) is legible. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the factory past is accepted as art, not erased—though the price is more communal than personal. Persistent constraint (the photo’s single arc) shapes the entire ritual, satisfying the 9+ quick test; only the faint abstraction of “collective healing” keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary-cage rule is broken on the page by the final shard of broken grammar, and the cost is the scholar’s lifelong identity as guardian of fixed meanings. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fractured phrase layers density until the pattern break reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“pale grey light…library at dawn”). No causal gaps; the crystal’s sonic reflectivity is taught early and paid off in the climax. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (mute scholar) shapes tactics, final image reconfigures meaning, cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “sound of growing older” is re-weighted from sought-after secret to accepted ambient erosion; cost is the prophet’s willing amnesia. Causal chain holds: vision → externalize → follow markers → surrender to hiss. Orientation anchored by sentence 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: chalk exhausts itself as the future exhausts him. Cost is visible in chalk dust and collapsing tapes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shutter’s breath reweights the premise—grief becomes portable lantern, not cure. Causal chain is intact: because hand escapes governor → therefore Elian restructures shutter to match its speed → therefore Green Flash is captured → ache is transmuted. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“cold iron floor of the Spire”) and never wavers. Cost is legible in the final line: “did not vanish, but it glowed now.”

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: steady sensory layering (scent of soil, golden warmth) tightens the stake until cadence equals survival. Orientation is swift—glass sanctuary above clouds, blood-work death-clock—anchored by ~80 words; no penalty. One meaningful deepening: scent shifts from impossible jasmine to overwhelming promise, reweighting broken vinyl from relic to bridge. Closure lands as Charged Poise: cello’s final bowstroke coincides with Clara’s stillness; cost is the silence that now owns the room, a before/after legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the shadows… were simply crushed by the weight of the light” reweights the premise and carries felt cost in the image of terrified darkness pooling beneath her boots. The causal lens holds: each gear-connection and loop-closing narrows options toward the brutal revelation. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words inside the observatory with Elara’s action cueing “who/where/when.” Only waver is the memory-washing isle rule introduced late; because it pays off by erasing her triumph, no cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the wooden corpse is re-declared a “map,” reweighting death into possibility; parents feel the cost of hope in their swallowed tears. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat because/therefore linkage hinges on the tooth evidence forcing reframing. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—Thorne must speak before the parents see the body—shapes final tactics. Final image of “terrifying, beautiful hope” lands undeniable social cost: they will live inside his placebo constellation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern jewel glows, reconfiguring village futures without fire, cost paid by her tremor and the years of sky-loss compressed into that green tear. Causal lens holds: because the torches once burned the harbor, she therefore polishes light that cannot burn, narrowing options to this single prism. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“serpentine grotto”), well within the 120-word allowance. No meaningful tightening occurs after the memory flare; escalation plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The water-drip arrow is a textbook Accumulative/Textural hinge: it literally guides Elias to the amber and then to Mara, tightening both spatial and emotional vectors in one image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration— handing over the pendant reweights the ruin from corporate relic to shared nursery; the cost is the forfeiture of speech and the shared risk of being hunted. Orientation is complete within 50 words (who, where, when), lens holds from first sentence to last, no prop or motive lapse. The final hush is felt, not declared, satisfying the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing shell galaxy reweights the premise—saved hopes survive even after book closes; cost is the hollowed Elara & Elias’s heaving chest. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of hope-extractions tightens through mist cameos; final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation clear by ~80 words. No causality breaks; cameo mechanics stay consistent. Could reach 9.0 if one more constraint shaped tactics (e.g., a rule that each theft erodes Elias’s own memory).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine holds: abandoned ritual → bitter crops → tinkerer’s machine → vine bridge → song frequency → lunar strike → golden projection → collective dream. One clear transition (grafting the vine) tightens the stakes; the decisive change is the morning-dew dissolution that leaves the valley “different,” a resonant reconfiguration with the vine’s death as visible price. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: the machine’s “legendary attribute” is declared rather than foreshadowed, but the closure image still reweights memory, so the lens (Causal) remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fused copper map pulses with orchard rhythm, undeniable conceptual cost—landscape translated to portable relic—fulfilling CR criterion under Accumulative/Textural lens. Drive holds: because he endures frost, therefore starlight adheres; because flash-paper incinerates, therefore pattern is forever fused—each beat a density/cadence shift toward final reweighting. Orientation is anchored by 50-word mark and retains spatial clarity through skeletal orchard and kneeling workspace. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (alchemy of instants) pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s acoustic life is vacuumed into the timer, leaving literal silence—undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence intensifies via gear/timber diction until the final metallic thud recalibrates the stakes. Causality holds: the angle-study → peripheral gaze → timer-inversion sequence is linked without teleport. The only hairline slip is a 90-word orientation window before “Elias” is named; the marble cavern anchors early enough to waive penalty, but the micro-delay keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: grief transmutes to chalk stones, foreclosing any chance the villager will ever feel that sorrow again—an irreversible conceptual repricing. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence layers like shingles, grief copies itself, starlight strips fluidity; the cadence shift at the align-click crystallizes both stake and image. Setup anchors who/where/when within 120 words; orientation debt waived because the grotto’s disorientation pays off in the final image. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; no causal turns required under Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens: rain-kettle-skylight density tightens around the single stake—transfer grief into wood before the whistle. The kettle’s boil is the on-page clock; its shriek snaps crystallized time into flowing reality, reweighting options—she can now sip tea, not drown. Closure is Charged Poise: the wood sits “innocuous and still,” but the reader feels the cost she has off-loaded. No orientation or causality lapses; every beat is because/therefore under the boiling timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the sabotage memory reweights the entire premise with irreversible moral cost. Causal lens dominates—each camera-wheel click is a because/therefore step toward the final revelation. “He had broken the world to save it” is the charged image that makes the cost undeniable. Orientation is taught early via the mercury sky and invisible platforms; disorientation later pays off at the ghost encounter, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the star-map reconfigures the trash-strewn atrium into “stardust,” making the before/after legible with conceptual cost – the terminal lives, but the city outside still decays.  Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (confetti→brass→ionized air) tightens the stake of reclamation.  Causality is clean: sextant curvature → refractive index → hologram ignition, all on-page.  Cost is felt in the final image; no contradiction under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sun dries the singing stones, quiet returns, and Elian stands—cost is the ghost he abandons plus the daily choice now made unbearably legible. Causal chain: rain ➜ petrichor memory ➜ breach of sanctuary ➜ tactile communion ➜ renunciation; every step linked by therefore/because. Orientation anchored by word 70 (Order of the Null, granite walls, clock scribe). No lens ambiguity; accumulative texture escalates through sensory density until the final reconfiguration of silence as voluntary burden.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: sundial angle + hull-plate direction → proof of noon explosion → historical inversion. Orientation locks by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the city’s innocence is publicly unrebutted, Elias alone pays with private nausea—felt cost on the page. The only deduction: the winch-to-sundial leap is slightly under-cued (we never see him note the plate’s bend during the lift), a hairline causality fuzz that keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: because Elias seeks a seed, he decodes the knot; because he decodes, he harvests the premonition. Closure is a quiet conceptual re-pricing—the fog erases sea/sky boundary, mirroring how the future is now folded into him. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the final image of swallowed horizon makes the price felt. One hairline slip: “the ancient methods would survive another cycle” drifts toward commentary; a hairline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the severed thread held like a relic reweights absence into necessity. Causal chain: projection → explained absences → melancholy acceptance; each beat tightens under Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image crystallizes options—winter isolation now chosen, not inflicted. Cost is legible in the shared exhale of the house and the ink still wet on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the humming branch offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—new life created, father’s scream inverted into music—cost is the black sand dissolving and her breath she “hadn’t realized she was holding.” Causal linkage is lyrical but traceable: sand → mineral bridge → acoustic proof of compassion. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes”) and upheld. Accumulated/Textural lens holds; pattern of ashes→music taught early and paid at end. No slips touch closure; persistent constraint (ancestral blame) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: suspended geese → auditory breadcrumbs → box obstruction → stellar key → twist release. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“City of Forgotten Fountains”) and spatial logic never wavers. The decisive change—box opens, memories soak stone, geese resume—lands with visible cost: Elara’s pragmatic worldview is nicked, future workload implied. One minor loop: “psychic plumbing” is used twice within 30 words; otherwise propulsion is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the cold bioluminescent glow reweights the entire ancestral fire-curse and makes Xylos’s mourning obsolete. Causal linkage holds—because he forces the fractal gear into the stalled axle, the garden lights without combustion—cost is the immediate emotional vacuum that follows. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“ribboned expanse of the Nebula Garden”) and the sonar ping maps spatial stakes throughout. No lens ambiguity; the story teaches its accumulative pattern early and lands under it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s tangled knot reweights grief from ‘shape to be solved’ to ‘continuity to be lived,’ with undeniable conceptual cost etched into the granite. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every repetition of silk, moth-wing, and poem-meter thickens the pattern until the final break (cadence shift) reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the last line—last butterflies depart bearing the lesson—an image that makes the price felt even off-stage. Persistent constraint: the ribbon’s snagging logic shapes every tactical move from measuring coffins to tracing flight, and its final knot forecloses Elias’s prior aesthetic forever.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal chain is immaculate: stutter in escapement → Silas cannot stop time → he exploits the pendulum’s weightless pause → uses his flawed rake handle → microscopic correction lands. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pendulum resumes, carrying the wooden memory with it, reconfiguring the town’s shared time and Silas’s burden in one image. Cost is palpable—handle scorched, finger tremor, a little more of his guilt abraded. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored in the first 50 words; lens (Causal) is taught early and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sovereign case re-prices the chaos from rage to abandoned hope, a conceptual reweighting with mournful cost visible in the final image. The causal chain holds: border-thread decoding → dropped case → portrait of waiting; the lens is Accumulative/Textural. The one-scene orientation is taught early (Silas, silo, timer silence), so no orientation debt applies. The timer is an elegant escalator, but its single beat keeps escalation light; still, the tightening suffices under the short-form rule.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the models predict stagnation, therefore Elian engineers a fake shortage, collapsing probability into history. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the blank almanac becomes irrevocable future—paid the instant nib touches fiber. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (Obsidian Spire, frozen lake, blank vellum). No teleporting props; predictive method is set up, tested, and executed in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the glowing sheet is smothered, narrowing Elian’s future to clandestine infection rather than open revolt; the conceptual cost (possible mass subversion versus certain execution) is undeniable. The because/therefore chain is tight: pirate song → violet dust → must hide → coat → future inhalers. Causal lens holds from first tuning click to last breath. No orientation or prop drift; every beat advances either knowledge or peril.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ash stroke thickens the emotional density until the exhalation scatters both image and stake; the stilling rocker is the taught pattern that pays off as CR—permanence repriced as vapor—felt cost in Elara’s hollow peace.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: because the cog is missing, therefore Silas excavates; because he finds it, therefore the escapement lives and heresy ticks. Orientation anchors by line 4 (who/where/when). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the audible tick reweights the priests’ myth as lie and nails a social cost—he has started “a war without saying a word.” Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: plant seed → synaptic pruning → edible wisdom, each beat tightening risk. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he sits with the plate, path foreclosed, cost visible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens stays causal throughout. Only nit: the “laws like tough meat” line is early throat-clearing that slightly delays the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the hive died, Kael races up; because Silas is cursed-truthful, he taunts and delays; because the backup is ash, Kael’s path ends. One meaningful tightening—Silas opens the box—simultaneously closes Kael’s goal and reweights the city’s options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the dusk sky becomes the new “power,” with undeniable social cost (permanent blackout). Minor wobble: Kael’s prior knowledge of the tower makes the riddle obstacle feel slightly contrived, keeping it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the shard of hush becomes a parable of contradiction that reweights Elias’s whole quest. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-mechanical; each beat layers sensory density until the final image crystallizes option and cost in one silent inhalation. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5; the orris root’s displacement teaches the pattern early, so the mosaic design is legible. No lens ambiguity at the end—quiet bay, gray dawn, surrendered streetlights—earned stasis with conceptual cost intact.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the poison becomes cure, stone becomes womb, ampoule transforms from weapon to key. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens—each glowing vein reweights the moral frame until Elara’s stance flips. Cost is legible in her loosened grip and the expectant ocean silence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) surface within 120 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: perpetual staircase = closed energetic loop; chipped die = chaotic variable; equation = exploit. One meaningful tightening—die refuses to settle—triggers rupture that forecloses the infinite climb. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the staircase’s logic crashes, Elian pays with existential drop-into-void, reader feels before/after. Orientation clean by word 60; no teleporting props; set-ups (die, chalk, equation) paid off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing ideogram is answered by a pulse across the smog, proving kinship survives; Elian’s drained brush and sudden sleep show felt cost. Causal linkage holds: moonlight → brush → symbol → distant reply → release. Orientation is swift; greenhouse, night, and city are anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative/textural design tightens once and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the alphabet is re-priced from parchment to calorie, a shift legible and irreversible. The lens-to-ice-to-bread causal chain holds under an Accumulative lens; each beat adds density until the roaring water reconfigures meaning. One minor causality gap: the yeast’s centuries-long dormancy is accepted without friction, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the tide snaps back, erasing the hunger stone’s curse under violet light. Causal chain holds: yoyo→gyroscope→lens→polarity flip, each beat foreshadowed. The cost is conceptual—destiny itself rewound—made legible in the final image of the stone swallowed. One shard, one POV, lens clear; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because he chooses to feed the void apathy instead of terror, the mirror implodes. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (burned hand, broken glass, lifted stench). Dream-dictionary paradoxes are seeded early and paid off at climax. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crystal-clear Charged Poise: the storm’s bass note surrendered to her naming act, the orchard survives with audible warmth lingering in the wood. Causality is lyric-situational—every strike of the mallet widens the fractal acoustic shield until the gale is literally re-pitched; no step feels outline-like. Time, place, and agent are anchored within the first 90 words; no orientation debt. Cost is visceral: spray lashes skin, wood groans, the raft almost bucks—then the hush arrives and the price is the perpetual vigilance implied by “as long as she could interpret.”

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fracture reveals gears, the city is cargo, the sun is artificial. The reed whistle’s vibration → bass answer → shell crack is a clean causal chain that rewrites every prior assumption with undeniable cost. Orientation is taught by sensory anchors inside the first 120 words; the lens is Causal throughout. No leakage or soft reset; the final image freezes the newly priced world.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is immaculate: the Illuminated Letter changes hands at the ivy-riddled station, a decisive change that reprices truth with felt cost ("truth would hurt, like the winter pruning"). Causal lens is taught early and held: each beat is motivated by the petal-cued deadline, parallels escalate stakes, the Censor yields because her analogies collapse his shelter myth. Cost is viscerally on-page—he lets go, she burdens herself with dangerous evidence. No orientation or linkage lapse; the rose-cued armistice rule is never broken.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly ritual, ink, vial, mortar form a pattern whose final iteration (the sealed note) reweights the pavilion from ruin to reliquary. Closure is Charged Poise—the lantern’s last flicker certifies the secret is entombed and future readers will confront the city’s emotional fossil. Orientation and causality are clean; the only minor drag is a 140-word delay before “firm shore surveyor” appears, barely past the 120-word guardrail but the later payoff waives penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The blackout is the causal pivot that makes the decryption possible; when the turbine groans back, the lie literally re-locks on the page—perfect because/therefore linkage. The shift from heroic origin myth to penal manifesto is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the city’s glass walls could now shatter). No orientation drift: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Lens is causal throughout; no ellipsis or coincidence resolves the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the paper crane becomes an eternal, luminous creditor circling the Basilica, re-weighting ascension as perpetual torment. Causal chain holds: prism → blood → sheet → crane → launch, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchored at word 60; no prop teleporting; cost is the invisible gem that literally deletes itself once used. Lens is Causal; no contradiction at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: because the breakers cool → darkness → hunt begins → perturbation → vision → breaker snap-back → collapse. The final override key is a decisive change that reconfigures his options and costs him any return to normal life.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: star-trail navigation → terrace arrival → chip extraction → identity restoration, each beat a therefore. Orientation is locked by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the static becomes her autobiography, the Pilgrim’s surprise collapses into darkness, and her “missing pieces” snap into legible name-lines. Cost is on-page: “the Pilgrim slumped…into darkness.”

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gold needle’s weight reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens—density of guilt made legible in a single image. Causality holds: because he buried the Vane ledger, therefore the heir haunts him; because he kneels on the psychic shore, therefore the watch hand surfaces. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint—the watch hand now in pocket—shapes every future step. Cost is palpable in the final line: “heavier than any lie he had ever sold.”

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: broken lever → improvised brass stem → synchronized moon release; the snapped lever creates a Decisive Change that reconfigures both literal stakes (boy lives) and symbolic weight (Silas leaves the pull behind). Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Closure pays the cost: the once-tainted object becomes the literal key to forgiveness, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece is a textbook Accumulative/Textural arc: density of fog, copper wires, and metallic humming accretes until the stake—how to move forward—reweights from celestial to terrestrial navigation. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s eyes “gravitate toward the nearest pole,” a crystallized final image that forecloses the open-water path with undeniable conceptual cost. The persistent constraint is the humming transformer that replaces the siren song; the price is lifelong downsizing of vocation. One hairline slip: the phrase “when expectations collapse” is a touch editorial; if it were anchored in a sensory trigger it would hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: newspaper decode → elevator descent → lake oracle → ball sacrifice, each beat narrows options toward the decisive change. Closure is clean: throwing the ball away is a visible, irreversible act that reperceives his timeline and carries emotional cost on the page. Orientation is taught early (who/where/when by line 3), so no penalty; transitions are single-shot, scope default-safe. One minor causality bump: the lake’s “fractal futures” momentarily risks coincidence-ex-machina, but the story quickly re-anchors the vision as internally generated, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused stance of man-bird crystallizes in the moonlit orchard, the fortune ash reweighting the earlier prophecy with undeniable conceptual cost—he has indeed “become the sky” by letting human flesh burn away. Causality is tight: every ingredient of the censer, the timing “immediately after the phoenix rises,” and the metamorphosis biology are set up, used, and paid off in the final image. No teleporting props; the fortune slip introduced in paragraph two ignites the final beat. Drive lens is causal throughout; each beat tightens options (scent → dive → forced transmutation → touch) until contact forecloses ordinary humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is clean: the cards indict → he feigns incomprehension → ritual ends in Earned Stasis with felt cost (he forfeits the reclaimed time). Causal chain is tight under the Accumulative/Textural lens: ink saturates crack → images rise → spiral of cards reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn—recognition then refusal—sufficient for length; no escalation break. Persistent constraint: the empty linen spaces remain blank, foreclosing reconciliation; this charges the final image and satisfies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the door opens only after Elian’s joy-price is paid on-page. Causal lens holds—the needle-through-shadow beat directly enables the resonance Kwan Yin demands. One micro-turn (knot transmutes agony into acceptance) tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s white plume reweights every prior act of giving, and the cost—“hands empty once more”—is visible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of coincidence is taught early (“master jeweler”) and pays off in the violet spiral. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no ambiguity at closure. One meaningful tightening: the bugs’ light sinking into sand reconfigures eruption stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → therefore Elara acts; quill → therefore Cradle awakens; looping feeds → therefore fort is liberated. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s power source is permanently rerouted, felt in the “frequency change.” Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final “winking hush” and her secret smile—she alone bears the sabotage risk. One micro-turn at the sundial tightens options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is earned: the gauntlet throw is the causal trigger that locks eel energy to star dust, producing a literal pocket of friction whose cost Oren feels on his knees. The lens is causal—every beat (spiral layout, vial set-down, eel vector, switch throw) tightens until options collapse into the microsecond of stillness. Cost is unmistakable: “the bluff groan under the unnatural weight” and his post-capture collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers sensory density (ozone/alcohol, green dial, blooming red lines) until the final image reweights memory itself. Closure is a Charged Poise: the revealed map re-configures the city and the poet’s past in one visible cost—no longer fear but storm-kissed wonder. Causality remains intact: because he douses the map, therefore the scars appear. Timer’s buzz is the decisive cadence shift that locks the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Northern Door vector crystallizes peace as a live option and the blade-trap enacts its physical cost under glass. Causal lattice holds—each parry/riposte is a because/therefore argument that narrows to the single exit. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no penalty. One tightening only, but it is meaningful and lens-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: because the Weeper has vanished, therefore the Architect can plant; because they plant, they accept exposure. Orientation is clean by 50 words; moonrise acts as a taught temporal trigger that tightens the final beat. Closure is a Charged Poise: the seeds in cracked concrete reconfigure risk from stealth to spectacle, cost legible in the irreversible act. One scaffold dent: “It is beginning” restates the already-shown initiation; trim for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal lattice is airtight: fraying compass → stay-behind choice → clock mainspring rig → film-reel portal → arbor piano → bulb-death exit. Each step forecloses the previous option; the projector bulb’s finite life is the persistent constraint that shapes the final tempo. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last chord dissolves into applause-shaped darkness, reweighting the entire escape as a stolen grace whose price is already spent. No orientation debt; who/where/when is crystal by line 50 and the lens (Causal) stays pure to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: because the island hallucinates, therefore Elian must sieve dreams; because he sieves, the ridge snaps awake. One tightening beat—seed pressed into granite—makes the Decisive Change with palpable price (lost illusions, cold rain on raw skin). Orientation is anchored within 120 words; pattern of reality-checking is taught early and paid off at closure. Closure image of sprout encoding law/ancestors carries undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each sensory layer (cerulean regret, lace cipher, compass vibration) tightens the emotional density until the indigo bloom reweights the whole; orientation anchors land by line 4 and the closure image carries undeniable conceptual cost—he can never un-see the color of his apology.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds not through causal turns but via escalating density of decay imagery and perceptual deepening, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where entropy unites stellar and terrestrial fragility. Closure lands decisively in the final image—Elias accepting the “heavy burden” of inevitable ends with “quiet grace”—making before/after legible through reweighted meaning, not action. Orientation is immediate (“shattered glass of the observatory greenhouse”), and the flood’s aftermath functions as both setting and temporal anchor. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of emotional insulation, crystallized in the faltering of his implant’s overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s stance crystallizes when she reads the thermal memory in the frost, transforming passive survival into active pursuit. The causal lens holds—her knowledge of heat and cooling directly enables the discovery. Cost is legible in her stiff joints, bruised fingers, and scorched past. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (post-arson shock) pays off in the canyon’s sensory reawakening.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear orientation by line 3; causal lens holds: because air no longer carries sound, Elian uses heat-mapping to “hear” and intervenes when thermal dissonance threatens the orchids. The climax—a tactile, resonant correction using ceramic rods—resolves the inciting imbalance with decisive change. Closure is Earned Stasis: blooms endure, but only through exhausting, precise effort that echoes his shipwreck survival.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Silas achieves stillness only after performing the burial ritual, with the ghosts’ dissolution confirming the distress signal’s receipt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the psychic clamor intensifies until the beam cuts it off—and the cost (three days of ocean-floor walking, physical depletion) is legible in the final image. Orientation is immediate (“grand atrium of a forgotten underwater city library”), and causality holds via consistent metaphysical rules (“occupying impossible spaces”). No coincidences resolve stakes; every beat tightens pressure toward acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure intensifies through sensory density (wind, moonlight, silence) and ritualized repetition, culminating in Charged Poise. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—the wind’s howl reweighted from isolation to “song of endurance”—with tangible cost (constant risk, anonymity as burden). Orientation is clear by line 2; the bell’s return charges the ending without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the reservoir he was looking for was not a place, but an action.” This reweights the entire premise with emotional cost—Silas’s heart feels lighter because he spent what he hoarded. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: mist, light, thorns, and breath accumulate until the final act dissolves the knot. Orientation is immediate (“Silas adjusted the brass knuckles... Twilight Viaduct in Bloom”), and every beat tightens toward the healing climax.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story opens with clear orientation (who, where, when) and establishes a causal chain: retrocognition → stolen artifact → hyperbolic weaving → temporal rupture. Closure is a Decisive Change with undeniable cost—the shattering of traumatic memories—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. The spatial distortion directly destroys the floating photographs, making the before/after legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses escape to ensure seed survival, with visible cost (his life). The Causal lens holds—each action (decoding, inserting arrow) directly enables the vault seal.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery and escalating spectral urgency until Elias’s ritual reconfigures the spiritual landscape. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: his refusal to listen forces the ghost back into mystery, tightening the “tangled covenant” with felt conceptual cost—the peace she gains is born from denied confession. The Orientation Test is waived; early disorientation (“translucent crowding of those who refused to fade”) pays off in the final image of ghosts as “visual poems.” Cost is legible in the woman’s drained urgency and Elias’s held breath—a small but resonant physiological toll.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: death as the “only equation that had survived” reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density increases via sensory compression (“verdant gloom,” “sludge that might have once been newspapers”) until the urn shard halts reality’s flux.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: coherent pressure (blackout, failed hive) forces Silas’s stance crystallization into Earned Stasis—foreclosing technological restoration with visible cost (permanent loss of power). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality holds despite non-action because the refusal *is* the decisive act. Cost is legible in the ash, the dead bee, and Kael’s whispered “Yes.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: options reconfigured, stakes made legible in the amber dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and conceptual layering until the “shard of hush” crystallizes as both image and turning point. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias redefines “aliveness” not through action but through reframed perception, with visible cost—the acceptance of decay as part of vitality. The orris root’s placement initiates a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses his prior questing mode. Orientation is immediate, causality intact, and the drunk’s line functions as accidental catalyst, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the poison was the cure, and the stone was the skin” reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost—Elara must now shatter the vessel to wake thousands. The drive lens is Causal (“because/therefore” linkage: threading vine → light → mirrors → revelation → judgment fracture → decision), held rigorously from inciting incident to Charged Poise ending. Orientation anchors (who: Elara; where: underwater garden; when: post-secret) are clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the final image: silence becomes “expectant,” demanding pulse return.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elian’s actions directly trigger the staircase’s collapse via introduced chaos. Orientation is immediate (“cold limestone step,” “hazy vertical abyss”), and the closure—a Decisive Change with tangible cost (the void, stinging pain)—lands cleanly. The chipped die’s anomaly creates a thermodynamic paradox that forces system failure, satisfying cause/effect rigor. One tightening suffices: the shift from passive endurance to active sabotage via math.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery until the moonlight-inscribed symbol triggers a reciprocal signal—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the city’s apathy as permeable to empathy.

Every beat tightens the thematic stake without causal overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian accepts the loss of physical texts but reconfigures preservation into ingestion, crystallizing a new cultural stance with visible cost (moldy scrolls, drowned silence). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (rosewater, ice, bread) that culminate in a cadence shift from dread to defiance. Orientation is immediate (“Grotto City,” “Museum of Remnants”), and causality flows via seasonal thaw → humidity threat → baking solution. Cost is legible in the girl biting the ‘Home’ loaf: history becomes metabolized, not archived.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each beat follows from Elias’s deliberate actions, culminating in a Decisive Change—the tide reversing—as direct consequence of his invention. Orientation is immediate (“jagged shoreline,” “lighthouse,” “Elias”), and closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing: destiny is dismantled like a clock. Cost is legible in the shrieking mechanism and supernatural exertion, though personal sacrifice remains abstract. The causal chain is taut, inventive, and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias endures the void by offering vulnerability without terror, breaking fear’s hold with irreversible consequence—the fading luminance, the imploded mirror, the empty funhouse. The Causal lens holds throughout: each paradoxical turn (e.g., “to ascend, go down”) tightens options until the decisive act reconfigures reality. Cost is legible in the searing clasp, the cracked glass, and the final sensory shift to mundane dust. Orientation is immediate (“funhouse entrance,” “Elias stepped”), and disorientation serves the closure by mirroring post-resuscitation perception.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard survives not by resisting but by transforming the storm into song, with Elara’s body and breath as the fulcrum. Cost is legible in her heaving chest, lingering vibration, and the salt-washed bark—proof of endured violence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure: the turtles are machines, the Watchers operators, and the city cargo. This reweights every prior image with chilling cost—her brother was harvested, not lost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; the causal lens holds tightly (“because she blew the whistle, the turtle responded”). The fissure’s reveal is earned through shell-pattern logic established early.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Illuminated Letter’s exposure reweights the regime’s foundational myth, with cost legible in the ivy-cracked pillars and thorned rose stems. The Causal lens holds—Elara’s logic dismantles the lie because of prior historical parallels. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“disused railway station,” “Elara, a historian”). The petal’s fall tightens the timeframe decisively, narrowing options to immediate confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritualized acts until the final image reweights the entire premise: dreams fused with stone become load-bearing. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elias’s silent satisfaction crystallizes the stakes, making legible the cost of cultural erasure and the defiant act of preservation. Orientation is immediate (“iron chains groaned… drawbridge upward”), and every beat tightens around the central act of embedding grief into architecture. The underwater thud of dislodged granite isn’t coincidence—it’s necessary physical labor that enables the thematic entombment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Book’s lie dissolves to reveal Aethelgard as a penal colony, reweighting the city’s entire foundational myth with undeniable social cost. The blackout functions as both constraint and catalyst—without it, the microscopic grooves are undetectable—making the stillness causally essential. The turbine’s groan signals irreversible return to noise, crystallizing Elian’s charged poise: armed with truth but re-entering deception. Orientation is immediate (“sunken metropolis,” “forgotten library”), and the causal chain (blackout → stillness → tactile decryption) holds without coincidence.

Orientation is immediate (“The vessel was known as the *Cenotaph*...”), stakes clear by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change—the door opens—charged with conceptual cost: peace chosen only after accepting one’s capacity for evil. The blast door’s submission is directly caused by his completed inner work, satisfying tight cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Silas redefines transformation not as shedding but as surrender, with cost legible in his emptied hands and the mountain’s sigh. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory saturation (“vibrant hush,” “whispering hush”) until the spiral of bugs reweights the premise. Coincidences (no boots, fallen palm) complicate but do not resolve; agency lies in his choice to release the bugs. The celestial alignment and tidal pool are taught early and pay off in the reflective climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
