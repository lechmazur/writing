  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: the ledger discovery drives the brother realization, which propels her walk into the canyon. Orientation anchors (canyon, frost, post-fire timeframe) arrive early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—she releases the ledger and walks on, foreclosing the search with felt cost. The cost is legible in the act of letting go and the image of lightness. One meaningful tightening (brother's handwriting) narrows her options and the final walk reconfigures her stance from searcher to arriver.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (conservatory, post-capsize, tuning fork case). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the heat-map mechanics, the piano's awakening, and the storm's yielding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her resolve to "play" the storm with the wreck waiting—but the cost remains implied rather than visible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note emerges "warped and wet," reweighting silence as malleable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal escalation to an Accumulative/Charged Poise closure). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The causal chain—package arrives, lens vibrates, ledger blurs, Elias climbs, dead are acknowledged—links cleanly, and the final image of stillness as signal reconfigures the premise with felt cost (the lens crumbles, Elias adds his name). One meaningful tightening occurs when the lens forces the choice to climb. Cost is visible on the page in the lens's destruction and Elias's acceptance of mortality, satisfying the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through repeated midnight runs, the arbor burning, and the climactic twelve-bell ringing that forces communal stance crystallization (Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise). Closure lands with felt cost—visibility becomes a crime, the arbor is destroyed—and the final image (bell hung by Liora, wind ringing it) reweights the premise. Orientation anchors early (exile community, ridge, sanctions), and the escalation from secret charity to open defiance tightens options meaningfully, though the patrols' retreat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images (jasmine, fog, jade, breath) recur and deepen until the final viaduct-blooms image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive by paragraph two (camera obscura artist, viaduct at twilight), satisfying the ~120-word test. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow no longer split, love reclaimed into the living world), but cost remains abstract: what option did Elias foreclose by taking the jade, and what tactic changed? The river's floating embers and the child's shadow on the distant bridge suggest ongoing stakes, yet the pilgrim-become-keeper shift is declared rather than earned through a visible renunciation or tactical pivot. The lens holds, but the final image's cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Liora's realization that "texture wasn't something to discover but to survive" reweights the premise, and her shift to designing edges forecloses the path of solving centers. Cost is legible in her physical collapse and the act of destroying the fragment. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the photographs begin fading and the garden shudders, escalating to the spiral staircase and temporal trap before the climactic throw and reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Lena's decoding unlocks the vault, her piano-key gambit drops the guard, and her planting creates the closure image. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing—seeds as insurgency—with felt cost (empty pockets, stained hands, walking into hunger). Orientation anchors cleanly (carnival, tonight, wall falling). One structural friction: the arrow's notch-sequence ("impede, then proceed") and reverse-order insertion feel mechanically convenient rather than pressure-driven, and the guard's fall lacks clear causal setup (why does middle C collapse the floor?). These mid-sequence gaps prevent entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias collects imprinted absences across the forge visits, building density until the final copper imprint "remembers" and the greenhouse trembles. Orientation is provided early (forge, greenhouse, wrecks, aurora), and the wading-into-tide ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "he didn't try to name the colors" crystallizes his acceptance). Cost is present but oblique—he loses the forge and greenhouse to rising water, yet the price feels more atmospheric than a forfeiture that alters his agency. The lens holds, but the final image's conceptual weight ("let them fill the absences") is asserted more than earned through a decisive on-page act.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through layered imagery (moonbeams, portraits, flowers) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Liora's leap into light reweights her obsession with a felt cost (she "didn't" rise, but "the light remained"). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph. The jar-smashing turn functions as a micro-reversal that crystallizes her stance, and the closing image makes the reconfiguration legible. Cost is oblique but present in the implication that she sacrifices corporeal return for the stolen moment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—imagery and cadence build toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit lands on-page: Elara leaves the bookmark as "invitation or warning," walks a new path, and begins to blow glass at the observatory—crystallizing her choice to "build something fragile enough to matter" with visible cost (abandoning the flood project, carrying empty vessels). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the bookmark's crack is "not a wound, but a record," reweighting her father's legacy and her own practice. The flood sequence and final walk constitute a single resolution move under the accumulative lens, though the conceptual cost (what inquiry she abandons, what she commits to) could be slightly sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: Lena receives the cast message, which points to the shell's voice, which directs her to the ledger that proves her existence. The closure unit—walking out with proof—qualifies as Decisive Change with felt cost (she must bleed, face the archive alone, accept that fear remains). However, the girl's appearance and the ledger's exact location both arrive without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore chain. The Orientation Test is waived; spatial anchors (library, shelf, ladder) are clear by the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: silences are collected, the booklet's gold leaf flakes away, Eldrin dissolves into the map he sought to draw. The lens holds through to the final dispersal, and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Eldrin becoming "another layer of quiet") lands on the page. Cost is conceptual—the oracle's erasure into the night—but the Orientation Test falters: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening third without deliberate pattern-teaching, and the narrative never dramatizes a causal tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending reweights premise but lacks felt pressure because no live choice was at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accrue (looped timelines, violin voice, memory shards) toward a final reweighting. Orientation is delayed—who X-7 was before the procedure, what "the program" entails, and where this courtyard exists remain vague past the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing ("thoughts...came from the act of reaching") but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or visible price accompanies the final understanding. The courtyard dissolves and reforms without clear consequence, flattening the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric density, recurring motifs (lens, tickets, light), and a cadence shift toward "the world was speaking plainly." Orientation is prompt: registrar, lobby, forecourt by line three. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Lena stops translating, accepts the lens as perfect, leaves tickets for others—but cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than dramatized. The couple's departure and Lena's morning walk feel like asserted resolution without a visible forfeiture or narrowed option. Closure reads more as thematic summation than a reweighted stake with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (polishing ritual, garden's persistent knowing, marble motif returns with reweighted meaning at closure). Orientation is clear early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the elders shift from ledgers to learning vine names, and the vine dresser stands "straighter than it had been in years"—but the cost is declared rather than demonstrated on the page. The phrase "Some things aren't meant to be measured" borders on thematic summary. The transformation lacks visible forfeiture or a legible price that alters tactics in the final image, weakening the felt consequence required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a meaningful deepening when Elias adjusts the lever a second time and K-11 vanishes "elsewhen," reweighting his theory from hypothesis to demonstrated proof. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias rests his hand on the lever, no longer pulling, crystallizing his stance with the cost felt in the station's held breath and the departure of K-11. The nexus activation → specimen transition → AI warning → final restraint sequence coheres under the lens, and the ending image of the station holding its breath charges the cost without needing further action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory cues (water, lanterns, warped paper) and micro-revelations that deepen Elias's engagement with the ghost. Orientation anchors are present early (orchestra pit, flooded opera house, Elias with cello). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the duet between Elias and Clara transforms the space from tomb to collaborative vessel, reweighting the premise of haunting as conversation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the program shifts from abstract stains to direct instruction ("third row, seventh seat"), narrowing options and driving the floorboard discovery. Cost is felt—the opera house no longer a place of solitary silence—but remains more conceptual than visceral; the final image charges prior material effectively without a sharp before/after in Elias's external situation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~60 words (mountain station, post-fever, storm imminent). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (ozone, copper taste, barometer dip) and the smudged illustration motif, culminating in Liora's walk into the storm as Charged Poise—options crystallize (warn or vanish) with undeniable cost (station's destruction, her silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm shifts from "dawn" to "now," reweighting her oracle role. Cost is legible in the final image (footprints vanishing, radio humming unanswered), though the causal link between fever-clarity and self-erasure remains slightly elided.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens: the valve wheel turn triggers the geyser and Luz's apparition, then Elias's decision to carry the wheel rather than flee constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (he accepts the haunting as his inheritance). One meaningful tightening occurs when the water moves unprompted, forcing his hand. The radio's looped psychic voice at the end recharges the confession motif but does not obscure the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece opens in media res without clear who/where/when anchors by ~120 words (the keeper's name, the library's location, and temporal frame remain vague throughout), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ending reprises the swan-folding ritual and "the waiting was the point" echoes earlier material, but no tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with visible cost—the keeper remains unchanged, the ritual identical. The closure image ("let the library swallow them whole") asserts transformation without demonstrating a before/after or foreclosed path. No decisive change, no felt cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when early and builds through accretive callbacks (ridge, song, vial, eclipse) to a Resonant Reconfiguration at totality when Mira hums and "the ridge sang back." The closure crystallizes prior material with felt cost (Lila's relinquishment of the vial, Mira's breakthrough). One escalation beat—canceling appointments to drive to the ridge—narrows options and raises stakes. The piece coheres under its lens, though the final cost could be more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through layered images (tapestry, diaries, dragons, axis) that converge when the tapestry warms and the axis moves, reweighting Elias's solitary task as cosmic participation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final walk with pulsing tapestry and the line "Somewhere, the world remembered how to turn" crystallizes his role as witness-catalyst with felt cost (endless iteration, no human companionship). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The lens holds; no causality breaks touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (lighthouse keeper, island diner, tonight). The piece follows a mosaic Track B with ~six time-shards (tonight's copying, the knock, upstairs packing, men arriving, train departure, future lighthouse keeper) taught early and transitions remain legible. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Chen leaves, the cycle continues, cost is the lighthouse going dark for the first time in twenty years and the handoff of orchestration to another. The final image reweights the opening fortunes with conceptual cost visible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fisherman's daughter arrives and Chen must act. Cost is legible in the departure and the lighthouse's silence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who (loop pedal priest), where (dimensional anchor chamber), and when (before possession completes) arrive within the opening paragraph—waived. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but remains ambiguous through the midpoint; the piece layers motifs (indigo, silence, loop pedal) without clear pressure tightening until the priest's dissolution. Closure unit: the priest's absorption into indigo and the novice's continuation could qualify as Charged Poise or Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted through metaphor ("no longer there to hear it") rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or action that changes options on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where the priest's vanishing alters tactics or narrows the novice's live choices beyond resuming the same ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear early (glass spire, frozen lake, fortune-writer at dawn). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (shell, ice, music imagery) build toward the final conducting gesture, which functions as Charged Poise—a crystallization where Li Wei's stance shifts from passive recorder to active conductor with pressure undeniable in the moment. The cost is oblique but felt: he finally claims agency over his exile and grief. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell's fracture aligns with first light, reweighting his understanding from *hearing* to *holding*. The courier-waits beat and the ice-groaning finale cohere under this lens, though causality is loose and the "because/therefore" linkage is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough; the viaduct and Elias are clear by the opening lines. The closure effect—Elias merges timelines, the tablet crumbles, the viaduct vanishes—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of the tablet, end of the loop). Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the rune-tracing and collision are motivated moves, and the final dawn image reweights the loop motif. One meaningful tightening occurs at the collision beat, narrowing options and ending the recursive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cavern encounter deepens Elias's stake from private grief to pedagogical reimagining, and the closure—walking back with the record, imagining future students—reconfigures his relationship to silence with felt cost (he must abandon "stiff, proper scales" and accept that conventional hearing is foreclosed). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The needle's transformation from "filament of hush" (reminder of loss) to wrapped talisman ("silence isn't empty") charges the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when the phonograph delivers tactile music, narrowing his options to this embodied pedagogy. Cost is legible: he relinquishes the dream of sound-based teaching and commits to a method some will still reject.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail and mystery through a pattern of discovered objects (pigeon, message, recorder compartment) that deepen the threat. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Elias begins to record, crystallizing his stance as observer even as the unknown has "followed him back," and the cost is felt in his uncertainty ("wasn't sure he wanted to be found"). Orientation is clear early (courtyard, dusk, Elias alone with his device). One weakness: the escalation from passive observation to active recording feels more like a tonal shift than a meaningful tightening of options, and the cost of this choice—what path is foreclosed—remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (grotto, poet, rope, energy beings) appear early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the poet transforms the rope into a ladder and departs, reweighting the prison-escape thread with a new pattern. However, the cost remains oblique: we're told he's "heavier with the weight of a question" but the exact price paid (what path was foreclosed, what was risked or surrendered) stays abstract rather than concretely legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the beings add their luminous thread and the rope snaps from resonance, but the causal link between that moment and the ladder outcome feels more lyric assertion than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (Liora, greenhouse, post-fire world). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density accumulates through recurring images (bowl, violin, unfinished melody) and culminates in a cadence shift when Liora plays "the first note of tomorrow," a Charged Poise moment that reweights prior material. The tightening is meaningful—her renunciation of her father's melody to co-create with the child forecloses one path and opens another with visible cost. Closure lands on the page with felt cost under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (amber grotto, Liora, dusk, client transaction). The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the chemist leaves with "nothing but his own hands" after the petal crumbles, a Charged Poise moment where the cost (loss of the counterfeit comfort he paid for) is felt and his tears mark the stance shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when Liora presses the petal to her own wrist, fusing insight with empathy and transforming the fragrance from half-truth to raw wanting. The textural accumulation of static/charge imagery and the grotto's shifting light support the closure, though the final four paragraphs loop similar insights without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (seaside library, post-concert courtyard, Elias watching). The lens reads as Causal with Situational shading: the mistaken-address note triggers the locket offer, which precipitates the partnership proposal. Closure is a Decisive Change—Elias and the librarian move from strangers to active collaborators with a tangible plan ("rerouting crates"). Cost is legible: Elias relinquishes the locket he kept for years, and the final line about the ledger "balancing a little less neatly" signals a forfeiture of his profit calculus. One persistent issue: the locket's return hinges on a remarkable coincidence (her photo, her mother's initial) that strains causality; it feels engineered rather than earned, lowering the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (sculptor, orchard, crater rim). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (reeds → arbor → tags → constellation of handprints) and a cadence shift at the ending when Reed presses her palm to the obsidian and feels recognition rather than completion. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Reed stops chasing and accepts kinship as process, with the conceptual cost visible in "some kin arrived in their own time." The final image—lost languages as invitation—reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs layer (moths, pendant, canal, echo, giant) and the final act—pulling the echo's leash—reconfigures the city's dreaming state. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the giant shifts but does not wake, moths return, and Elspeth resumes her work with the echoes "only just beginning to speak," crystallizing a fragile equilibrium. The cost is implicit rather than visceral—we infer effort and risk but do not see a forfeited path or visible wound. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, stakes), and the accumulative pattern is taught early, but the final beat's cost legibility falls short of undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure: the conjurer shifts from seeking precision to accepting ambiguity, crystallized in "Some things couldn't be preserved. But they could be remembered." The orientation is swift (conjurer, cavern orchard, post-silence, by the second sentence). The cost—letting the illusion dissolve, pocketing the now-clouded eyes—is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mist almost forms her face and he reaches, forcing the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (library, dawn, Elias in crawl spaces) arrive within the first three paragraphs; no penalty. The piece follows a causal lens: Elias's cache habit → outage creates opportunity → tape reveal → woman's recognition → key exchange, with each step motivated. Closure is a Decisive Change (Elias steps into light, offers the key) with visible cost (ending seventeen years of hiddenness). The cost is legible in "For the first time in seventeen years, Elias didn't retreat." One meaningful tightening (tape → photo → key) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Liora, nursery, storm season) land early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through observation (leaves trembling, cells reconstructing), reflection (father's nursery, her pruning habits), and a cadence shift when she pulls up stakes and surrenders control. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Liora's refusal to record or intervene forecloses her prior method with visible cost (the trellis sags, wild growth takes over, she hands a leaf to a customer expecting roses). The final image—arms spread, water washing over her—reweights the opening's "trembled" leaves into "danced," charging the transformation with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors immediately: Elias, tide-stolen sleep, salt-cracked mud of Liora. The brooch-to-altar-to-cavern sequence unfolds causally under a hybrid lens (causal discovery escalating into accumulative mythic convergence). Closure lands on-page: the returned brooch and straight rain signal a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias accepts the island's exchange with visible cost (sleeplessness transmuted to vocation). One meaningful tightening occurs when he places the brooch and the vision floods him. The lens holds, though the convergence mechanics remain slightly abstract ("threshing" undefined until retrospectively reweighted by the ending image).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt (pilgrim, cave, dusk) and the inciting touch of the pearl summons the entity cleanly. The closure—Liora leaves the pearl and exits with new understanding—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but cost is asserted rather than shown: her hands are "empty," heart "full," with no dramatized forfeiture or tactical constraint. The vision sequence (baker, child, old man) functions as telling rather than a causal reversal that narrows options. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (cave song, pearl glow, entity's philosophy accrete toward reweighted stance), held consistently, but the final image lacks the felt price required for high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: Elias tosses the valve to the child, crystallizing options (the city will sound again, but not through him) with felt cost (his work shifts from compilation to witness). The piece follows an Accumulative lens—fragments gather density until the valve's return reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ledger becomes lighter and the valve passes to the next generation, fulfilling the RR test. The cascade of community objects (locket, teacup) deepens pressure without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, building density through mist, cracks, vault, and phantom punch motifs until the platform vision reweights Elias's obsession. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): he names the truth, receives the vision, then chooses to step back into the mist rather than follow—a renunciation with felt cost. The platform vision offers a micro-turn but the final image of folding the map with a deliberate crease charges the closure. Cost is legible in the line "only carried with trembling certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through whale song, tile symbols, and memory fragments. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes a "cartographer of echoes"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—her skepticism dissolves without visible friction at the climactic beat. The tile glows, the brother appears, and she accepts it; no tactical foreclosure or price paid in the moment weakens the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the escondite's transformation accumulates through sensory intensification and conceptual layering toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant—Lysander's "first honest thing" crystallizes a stance with palpable reweighting). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (letting go, dimensional dispersal), though the felt stakes remain somewhat abstract. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The lens holds without contradiction, and one meaningful deepening occurs when he drops the fragment and the escondite dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on the page: Lira abandons the ledger and ink pot, choosing collective action over her father's zero-sum math—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with visible cost (she burns the ledger "in her mind" and flees). Drive lens reads Causal with hybrid accumulative texture; the ink pot's shattering and the minister's men approaching tighten options. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One linkage feels thin: the girl's wet footprints and border-crossing backstory arrive without prior setup, creating a minor causality gap in how she knows Lira or why she's there at 3 a.m.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers ritual and invented histories toward a final sunrise image that charges the bonsai forest. Orientation is clean (stationer, workshop, mountaintop, after-hours) by the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stationer commits to continuing his work with Elara's laughter audible and a new tree sketched, crystallizing his stance as inventor-archivist. Cost is felt but oblique—he forgoes engagement with the waking town to remain in his invented past. However, the deepening is modest: the lamp's new hum prompts one transcription session, then dawn arrives without a second tightening or material constraint that narrows options. The pattern of collecting textures recurs but does not escalate pressure; the final image reweights prior material without a visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (port, Daniel, death certificate error). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density builds through layered fragments (label, stories, ledger page) toward a final image of dissolution. However, the closure unit—"he stepped forward, and the water closed behind him"—gestures at transformation without landing a legible cost or decisional fork; the "erasure was real" functions as summary rather than on-page stakes shift. The ledger discovery (his own handwriting) sets up potential reversal but deflates into passive shedding rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shell, cello, and observatory accumulate meaning through resonant hums and reimagined voices, culminating in the blank shell and the line written on skin. Orientation anchors (abandoned observatory, Elias cross-legged, painted shell in hand) arrive quickly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the riddle shifts from code to chorus, and Elias's role reconfigures from exposer to keeper. Cost is conceptual—the journal dissolves, the shell goes blank—but the final image makes it undeniable. One tightening occurs when the compass stills and points inward, narrowing his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid; the mural sequence links because/therefore but the closure relies on accumulative density ("caught between two worlds, but building a third"). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~80 words. The closure offers Charged Poise—Elira's final spray-paint action crystallizes her stance—but the cost is asserted ("There was still time") rather than dramatized on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the ending beat. The foundation chip embedding reads as symbolic gesture without tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat ("crater inspector, Elias Voss...summit of Tycho Crater"), and the piece follows a clear causal arc: plant canister → photograph → board ship as drones approach. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's final photograph crystallizes the tension between preservation and erasure, with the cost felt in "a world that would never know what it had lost. But he would." The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid, with the canister pulses and photo sequence tightening pressure toward the final image. Closure cost is conceptual and legible, though the physical act of boarding rather than a final image choice slightly diffuses the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Elias, depot, maiden voyage, his blindness). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—sensory fragments and recurring water-barrel/light motifs build to a pattern break when the navigation chimes and mist parts, reconfiguring the *Mariner*'s path from flawed to true. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the ship departs along a golden corridor; Elias returns to his cracked watch, reweighting repair as his persistent, quiet vocation). Cost is conceptual and felt: he remains unseen, unacknowledged by the crowd, his gift absorbed into the world's hum. The single meaningful deepening—his silent intervention—alters the ship's fate without altering his own, an earned stasis that forecloses public recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation patterns, the phrasebook fragment, and river convergence accumulate toward the ice-cracking moment and Lena's step forward—a Charged Poise that reconfigures her role from seeker to herald. Orientation anchors quickly (outpost, frozen lake, Lena's profession). The cost is conceptual (she vanishes into the lake, sealing behind her) and legible in the final image, though the emotional price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening is present and closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory callbacks (shutter, chime, well, child's laughter) that reweight the dominant stake of revival. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tuner stops, the town exhales, and the final image ("Balance... was a thing you kept") crystallizes the ongoing cost and reconfigures the initial archway tension without requiring a decisive physical act. One meaningful deepening—from silence to chorus—is sufficient at this length, and the cost (endless walking, "the work was not done") is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening beats (Liora, temple, rebreather countdown) and establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the hush "gathers" through layered images—signal, perfume, memory—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she refuses future calls and moves inland. Cost is visible: she sells her gear, abandons the dive life, and carries the scent-memory forward. However, the three-day surface-team rescue introduces a convenience that undercuts the rebreather's stated one-hour limit and the temple immersion's causal stakes; this retroactive patch weakens escalation without breaking closure outright.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative lens early (copperlight imagery, whispers, lattice transformations) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: Elias claims "Nothing...just the light" becomes truth, reweighting his father's legacy. Cost is legible—he's now complicit in the deaths, carrying a secret the village won't believe—and the final return ("this time, it's yours") reconfigures his stance from retrieval to authorship. Orientation waived: lighthouse prison, reef, and dawn are anchored by line 2. One meaningful deepening occurs (lattice unfolds, name extracted). Slight lens waver mid-piece (causal climb mechanics coexist with textural drift) keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density and pattern accumulation toward a reconfiguration). Orientation anchors arrive within opening lines (greenhouse, Liora as ghost, bead in soil). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Liora dissolves, Vesper awakens, orchard holds the echo), but cost remains largely asserted ("veil began to unravel") rather than dramatized with a legible emotional or tactical price tied to specific on-page choice. The bead's crumbling and Liora's vanishing happen in passive sequence rather than through her decision under contradictory pressure, weakening the felt cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure—Elias stepping toward dawn with winged shadow—reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing his shift from passive weaver to active builder, but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized on the page (the illustration plate is "cool," the carvings are done, no visible price paid or path foreclosed). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with pattern-taught imagery (winged figure, tide, labyrinth-as-loom), yet the final reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure or felt cost required for high-band entry. The sleepwalking sequence loops similar beats (press plate, veins rise) without meaningful tightening until the Heart Chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through repeated descent, root-following, and discovery beats that deepen the orchard-restoration stake. Orientation anchors (tomb of Saint Maris, catacomb setting, Elias as POV) arrive cleanly within the first third. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the sapling cracks the sundial, Elias laughs and commits to going deeper—with felt cost in his years of labor and the village's cautious hope now validated. The accumulation of root-pulse, mural, dream, and sapling creates a coherent tightening, though the dream sequence introduces a slight parallel-world ambiguity that doesn't fully pay off in altering his next choice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Lena's choice to mail the letter and continue her work crystallizes her stance as someone who "moves through the world without leaving ripples." However, the cost is asserted through metaphor ("a secret kept," "shadows") rather than made undeniable through a forfeited option or visible consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (the hesitation before mailing), but the final image doesn't fully recharge prior material with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with lyric aspirations, but the closure image—observatory dome shattering, embroidery scattering as seeds—arrives as assertion rather than earned reconfiguration. The Orientation Test is borderline: "cobalt observatory" and "Elias" anchor who/where by the opening, but the coup's mechanics, the Council's actual threat level, and the courier's identity remain vague past the 120-word mark without payoff at closure. The piece teaches a pattern of symbolic synchronization (flame, telescope, embroidery) but the final "broadcasting" beat summarizes effect ("the city would wake to find its lies unraveled") rather than dramatizing cost or changed options on the page. The courier flees, enforcers arrive, yet Elias "smiles" and "closes his eyes" in what reads as conceptual victory without visible price—Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure at the final image, but the stars' singing feels decorative rather than a reweighting that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a lyric pattern early (singing spirits, condensation messages, repeating shard/moonlight imagery) and accumulates density toward the release of the letter. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—Liora letting the letter drift into the water—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the moment of decision crystallizes) with felt cost implied through the repetition of evoked words and the final departure from the labyrinth. One meaningful deepening occurs when she evokes words a second time "without fear," reweighting her stance. Cost is legible in the final image of the empty pocket and her smile, though emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a situational lens—Lena decrypts grief artifacts in a liminal space—and delivers Charged Poise at closure when she stands and walks toward "other broken things," reweighting her role from single case to iterative practice. Orientation anchors arrive early (atrium, dusk, Lena with coral and cast). However, the cost remains oblique: the ending posture suggests continuation rather than foreclosure, and the "ribs singing" callback doesn't materially narrow options. The nurse's exposition and the boy's arrival feel coincidental rather than causally linked, weakening the because/therefore chain even under a situational read.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Liora, ruined orchard, fog-bound district, "first time") arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Liora finds the fragment, develops the film by pressing it against the fresco, then strings the film in the orchard to project the lost festival onto the fog. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the orchard "no longer felt like a ruin" but "a promise," reweighting the space's meaning and Liora's stance. Cost is conceptual (the film will fade by morning) but not viscerally felt or paid by Liora; the transformation is witnessed by others without her forfeiting anything on the page, which keeps the ending just shy of high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a Hybrid lens (accumulative/lyric textural work with causal elements), but the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration that wobbles: Liora "steps through" into perpetual creation, which lands on-page, yet the cost is conceptual and abstract rather than viscerally felt. The nested awakenings teach a pattern early, and the ending pays it off, but the final image ("laughter tangled in the sound waves") reweights previous material through assertion more than dramatized consequence. The orientation is clear early, and the lens is identifiable at closure, but the cost is implied rather than undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resistance imagery (greenhouse → public garden → morning glory signal) and arrives at a Conceptual Repricing: the system cannot tax "the spark of a thought, wild and untamed." The closure image (gourd seed splitting in the dark) reweights the premise with conceptual cost—surveillance defeated by semantic evasion—though the felt price remains oblique. One substantive tightening occurs when the dandelion message forces caution, but the climactic "now" signal and Elias stepping "into the chaos" are compressed into summary rather than dramatized on the page, muting the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (lyric imagery, timeless setting, pattern of singing → transformation), and the final image of the shell sealing and the wind supplying a title offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) remain vague past 120 words—"three hundred years" and "inside a gargantuan shell" lack spatial and temporal grounding that would help the reader track causality. The cost at closure is conceptual (rest without sleep, cocoon-like enclosure) but not legible as a decisive forfeiture or change in options; the poet's stance and tactics remain unchanged from the opening. The sequence of beats (postcard → ghost → manual → net cast → rest) reads as accumulation rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens but does not deepen or tighten pressure meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora's choice to destroy the chime forecloses preservation with visible cost (wreckage, her own name whispered back, learning to live with echoes). Causality tightens from repair attempt → awakening → breaking, each move narrowing options. The Drive Lens reads Causal with Accumulative/Textural support (density of sensation, cascading imagery); the ending reconfigures her curatorial mission into acceptance of mourning without confusion. Orientation anchors early (opal library, clouds, caretaker role). One meaningful deepening occurs when repair becomes awakening, forcing the terminal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara restores the archive, the emissaries' torches gutter out, and she walks forward with the shard, trusting her voice—options are reconfigured and the cost (decade of mistrust, risk of burning) is felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the inkwell shatters and the mist seals the scrolls, reweighting the stakes from destruction to restoration. The lens holds, though the final third drifts into summary and thematic declaration rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Liora's act of unspooling the chain and presenting the blueprint reconfigures the tactical landscape, and the elder's nod signals a shift in collective stance with felt social cost (breaking from rigid doctrine). The piece operates under a Causal lens with motivated linkage: envelope → blueprint discovery → elder confrontation. Orientation is clean (amphitheater, Liora alone, then valley table). One meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to present the blueprint rather than walk away, narrowing options and raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring dust-mote imagery, meteorite handling, and pigeon routines, culminating in the hum and sheet music arrival—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise) where Elias accepts the echo of song with visible cost (years of silence broken). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (attic, Elias, pigeons, fire). The piece coheres across its reflective density without losing present-tense grounding. One small slip: the fire's exact stakes remain abstract, slightly muting the cost's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (farmhouse porch, missing child, maze architect). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues accrete (logbook code, corn husk note, terrace grain) toward the sinkhole reveal, then the firefly-lit chamber reweights "center" and "threshold." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias's descent and "teach me the codes" crystallize a shared crossing with palpable cost (he abandons rescue for initiation). One friction: the logbook's BFE-7 code is underlined but never explicates how it led him to act; the leap from "butterfly effect" to sinkhole relies on intuition more than shown linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and lyric particulars (bioluminescent maps, jellyfireflies, the respite hour) build atmosphere and recur with shifting context. However, the closure—Elara tucking the feather into the logbook and smiling—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) whose cost is largely implied rather than dramatized on the page. The final image reweights prior material but does not make the cost of staying undeniable in action or felt consequence, capping the score below high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of memory-shards accumulating pressure through the cave exploration, and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the recollectionist accepts that "the paths disappeared so new ones could be found" and steps forward with the weight of absorbed lives). Cost is legible in "her heart heavier with the weight of a thousand half-remembered lives." One meaningful deepening occurs when she lets the memories surge into her. Orientation is swift (kneeling recollectionist, geode, crater glass). The accumulative design holds, but causality is loose—why does her blood glow? Why does the cave seal itself?—and these convenient shifts slightly undercut closure inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early; no orientation debt. Pressure accumulates through environmental variables (tide, shadow, torch, gull) that Lior incorporates beat by beat, tightening his performance calculus. Closure attempts Charged Poise—Lior resumes play with renewed commitment to his pattern—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized. The moth-woman's challenge ("You played *us*") is deflected with an aphorism instead of a visible forfeit or tactical shift, weakening the reconfiguration's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are delayed: who, where, and when cohere only after multiple paragraphs of lyric description, though the piece teaches its accumulative pattern early enough to avoid the full Orientation Test penalty. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through image density and cadence rather than causal linkage. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the verse completed, the body transformed—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited option or consequence. The piece signals its lyric mode early and sustains it, yet the final image reweights prior material more through tone than through a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—stone, ripples, light—and the closure reweights the ritual through the act of reaching for the next stone, foreclosing passive vigil with felt cost. Orientation anchors (Elias, atrium, dawn) land by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the ripples "read" the harbor's memory and worry, then Elias's breath, building density that charges the final turn. Cost is legible in "the world shifted—just as it always did—around the quiet certainty of the atrium's light" followed by his return to motion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, returning images (fire/box/cracks), and a cadence shift at dawn that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (ridge, moon, box) appear early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias creates the drawing, sends it, leaves the box, and walks toward the untouched valley—a crystallized moment where options are reconfigured and cost is felt (he relinquishes the relic and steps toward repair). The felt cost is legible in the act of leaving the box and the descent. One meaningful deepening occurs when he opens the box and sees cracks as veins, shifting his stance from grief-holder to pain-translator. Weakness: the backstory density (~35% by line count) occasionally flattens present momentum, and the "alchemize" realization reads slightly tell-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric accretion of images and equations). Orientation is adequate—grotto, Liora, gauge established early—but the piece never delivers a legible closure unit with cost. The "patterns revitalized" beat and the final image of the gauge at infinity offer conceptual reconfiguration but no felt price or foreclosed option on the page; Liora simply smiles, works, and releases everything to the tide without a before/after that trades or loses something concrete. The parallel-timelines framing is gestured at but remains ornamental, never constraining a choice or altering tactics. Causality is loose: the gauge's needle spinning and the decorations glowing lack motivated triggers, and the final transformation ("the grotto held, its walls no longer a boundary but a threshold") abstracts rather than dramatizes consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: film negative discovery → recognition of mother's eyes → father's diary words → sealed door → mural completion → corridor transformation. Orientation anchors (ivy passage, Elias, cartographer role, post-climate-shift world) land by ~80 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the mural completion shifts the corridor's echo from whisper to song, and Elias walks away lighter but still burdened—a stance crystallization with visible cost: he leaves the threshold open, releasing the legacy). One meaningful tightening occurs when the door opens and the shrine forces confrontation. Cost is legible in "no longer a chain, but a thread he could choose to follow or cut" and the act of walking away. A minor slip: the sealed door's literal disappearance and replacement with a glowing threshold reads convenient rather than causally motivated by the mural's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Liora, mirage painter) and where (terrace) within the opening lines; the timeframe (hush before bells) is signaled early and paid off at closure when the last bell tolls and she vanishes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (mirrors, heartbeats, lullabies, bells, rainbows) and the final cadence shift—"The last bell tolled. The rainbows faded."—reweights the dominant stake with a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she walks away, pockets empty, never looking at her own reflection). Cost is conceptual and felt in the image of the empty terrace she once saw, but on-page cost at closure is muted; the heartbeat unravels, the woman receives her vision, and Liora simply continues her pattern without visible consequence in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (terrace, midsummer, two negotiators) by the second paragraph. The escalation follows an Accumulative lens: Veyra invokes the past signature, Kael's hand moves toward the blade, then toward the pen—a meaningful tightening that narrows his options through her tactical reminder. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael signs with visible ambivalence, the cost legible in "his voice was already unraveling," and Veyra's walk away with the "quiet violence of hope" reweights the dominant stake. The inferred lens holds; one credible deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and timeframe anchor by line 1; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric accretion of salt/egg/drought imagery toward a conceptual repricing). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the egg in the fissure reweights Elias's legacy from pure erasure to an ambiguous counterpoint. However, cost is asserted ("the cracks spelled… *enough*") rather than felt on the page—no specific forfeiture or tactical narrowing occurs in the placement act itself. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, but the final image's reconfiguration is conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph, avoiding orientation debt. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the three threads build density and the final image (snow melting, stars watching) attempts to reconfigure meaning. However, the cost at closure is declared ("set them free," "refused to sleep") rather than shown through a forfeited option or altered tactic; the threads snap after she exits, erasing agency in the moment. The middle—unlocking the gate—does not narrow her options or complicate her stance; each thread yields without resistance that would test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: reflection and image accumulate toward a stance shift. Orientation anchors arrive (dome, campfire, past puppet show) by the first third. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elias decides to return and "let the strings loose"—reweighting his approach with conceptual cost (abandoning precision for transparency). However, the cost remains implied rather than undeniable; no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the miner confrontation is summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal linkage to the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues density through recurring images (wing, spiral, wind) and a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors (grotto, Lior, monarch migration) arrive by ~100 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Lior's continued remembering despite the migration's end—but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence where forgoing another path or paying a price is legible. Apply −0.6 for cost ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early—braided rope, punched card, ceremonial reconfiguration—and accumulates density through the recombination ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elira accepts that preservation is transformation, dissolving the card into the sanctum's bones and walking away unburdened. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the physical artifact and the foreclosure of her prior stance. One substantive deepening—names move from echoes to living heat—suffices for this length. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (sanctum, kneeling, punched card scrap).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (bunker, storm, Lior's arrival) within the first ~100 words. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (murals, terminal messages, film reel) and culminates in the forest-dissolving transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lior steps forward into the dance with the path, and the final image ("the path, finally, chose") reweights the premise. Cost is oblique but legible in the wafer seal's ash and her surrender of certainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film shows the left path choosing dream-Lior, which narrows her understanding and primes the final step. Minor deduction: the circularity insight arrives late without prior setup, creating a micro-causality wobble that doesn't fully break closure but reduces inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern and density build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final observatory moment where Qishti's understanding crystallizes. Orientation anchors (astronomer, palace, dusk) arrive early. The closure image—lines on his skin, stars burning brighter—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the shift from measurement to felt dialogue). One slight weakness: the underground sequence feels like scaffolding toward the insight rather than a choice-driven tightening, and the cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: the sanctuary breathes, memory fragments layer, and the music box recurs with reweighted meaning until Lior's final act (pressing the pin back, then releasing the box) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis that forecloses resentment with felt cost. Orientation anchors (Lior, sanctuary, music box) land by ~100 words. One friction: the "world outside realigned itself, softer now" moment borders on telling the closure effect rather than anchoring it in a concrete image with undeniable pressure; the cost becomes fully legible only in the subsequent walking-away beat, which does land on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning: fog, mirrors, sextant, and light accumulate toward a final image of stars and threshold-crossing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the mirror maker steps through a boundary that previously constrained him, and the final image reweights the orchard, mirrors, and sky motifs with undeniable pressure. However, the cost is asserted ("let the last boundary fade") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or action that narrows options on the page, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise (the mender eats the forbidden apple, binds the ribbon, leaves the doll as promise) with felt cost (pride yielded, the daughter's absence persists). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the orchard-cathedral setting, recurring ribbon, and seed all accrue meaning, culminating in the sprout's accusatory twist and the apple-bite as contract-break. Orientation is swift (mender, cathedral-orchard, post-contract breach). One meaningful deepening: the question whispered to the seed triggers the sprout's answer, reweighting all prior material. Cost is legible: the mender must admit their failure to "read the cracks" in their daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural—blossom visits stack symbolic weight—but the closure (Veyra cataloging the cameo for "the next one") lands as Charged Poise only if we accept that preparing the artifact for another crystallizes options. The orchard's door-crossing and museum return feel like soft resets: she enters, the museum is intact, the cameo pristine, with no on-page cost anchoring the "complicated" → catalog choice. The reflection's warning ("That's dangerous") is acknowledged with laughter but never pressures a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: symbols and gaps accrue meaning through the botanical diary's reverse-blooming flowers and the Library's "spaces where answers should be," culminating in Elias becoming a gap himself—a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the traveler speaks Liora's name and the Library opens, reweighting all prior "absences" into active erasure. The causal chain holds (theft → research → confrontation → trap), though the traveler's sudden lunge and unraveling compresses the final turn. Cost is visible: blank diary, forgotten name, Elias trapped in the aisle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the emerald swatch accumulates meaning (tracing → pressing to wrist → absorbing the name → bleeding into sister), and the final garden entry reweights the opening cage/prison motif. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Liora steps into the garden to pull other souls home, crystallizing her stance with felt cost (the ship sinks, carnival lights extinguish). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One minor causality slip: the carousel "started to play" without prior setup, but it does not break the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph ("clock tower's mechanism room… Dr. Elara Vey"). The door's appearance and Elara's rope manipulation create a clear causal tightening: reweaving unlocks the door, the library appears, and the wax seal materializes. However, the closure unit—Elara becoming "part of" the fable and the door vanishing—lacks a fully legible cost on the page; the seal's warmth and her decision not to record feel more like symbolic satisfaction than a foreclosed path or visible price paid. The final image reweights the premise (archive by living, not recording) but the conceptual cost is oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Eldrin, harmonic caves, post-arrival timeframe). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail and the bloom of hush accumulates meaning until the final image reweights the caves as conversation rather than conflict. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the storm becomes lullaby, the beings harmonize, and fresh cracks promise new language—with conceptual cost (mutual silence replaces dominance). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bloom "sang...in invitation," transforming resistance into door.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening climb; the pavilion hums, the world has collapsed, and she carries the prism. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers coincidences (prism shattered when transmission died, hush settled when she touched it, constellations match her mother's birth night) until the beacon flare reweights the dominant stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she sees "the shape of it—the meaning in the fractures" and steps into wind with the mended crystal, the pavilion's song "not gone." Cost is visible—she accepts another solitary climb tomorrow, foreclosing hope for human connection but embracing the work of meaning-making. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (flags, shadow, storm, memory) and a cadence shift at the vision-touch moment that reweights her understanding. Orientation anchors who and where early, though "when" remains atmospheric ("after fog becomes solid"). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she stops measuring and accepts the river metaphor—but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than decisively visible on the page, which limits the charge. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: blooms pulse, stars return, the mosaic message recurs, building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the sky transforms and Liora walks on heavier but sure. Orientation anchors (Liora, fortress, dusk) land by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first rocket triggers the fortress trembling and bloom-flare, narrowing Liora's options to descent or further defiance. Cost is legible in "lighter pockets" and the fortress remembering her, foreclosing a return. The lens holds without contradiction through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the grotto scene layers sensory detail, reflection, and the cicada's symbolic weight toward a final gift that reweights the fisherman's trajectory. Orientation is clear early (grotto, pause in conversation, fisherman present). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gift) that shifts the fisherman's future texture, and the final dream image charges the piece with the damp sleeve. Cost is present but oblique—the chronicler surrenders her grandmother's gift, and the damp sleeve suggests a lingering burden—but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One tightening (the cicada's warmth, the shape of the future) deepens the stake without a sharp reversal, fitting the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. The piece teaches its pattern (inversion episodes, collected silences) early and returns with escalating density. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the child climbs, the bunker collapses, the father is left behind. The three-inversion structure tightens options cleanly. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The doll's sudden urgency ("Now you choose") and the gilded palm's unexplained mechanics introduce minor causal convenience, preventing full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the storm glass, prism refractions, and dial adjustments accumulate toward a charged image of quiet work. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the passenger's weight "recalibrated," terrace lighter, storm glass clear), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no concrete option is foreclosed, no specific path abandoned on the page. Orientation anchors appear late (gondola, terrace, canal blur together in early paragraphs), triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The lens holds, but the cost test is not satisfied with an exact on-page sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late causal turn. The piece anchors who/where/when by ~120 words and escalates through discoveries (flake, hatch, murals, throne chamber) that deepen understanding. The closure—melting the throne and walking away—constitutes a Decisive Change with the conceptual cost (ending ascension) legible on the page. However, the cost feels more stated than felt: "the weight...lifting" and "chains...rusted to dust" tell us freedom rather than dramatizing a visible forfeiture. One meaningful tightening occurs (descent to chamber, realization, dissolution), meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the final image relies on summary assertion ("the past finally at peace") rather than a charged particular.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational pressure: the threshold fades, shadows encroach, and Lior's reckoning with burned bridges accumulates until the door appears. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): stepping through reweights the sanctuary's meaning and his isolation. Cost is felt conceptually—he won't look back—but the exact price (what he loses by leaving) remains slightly oblique. Orientation is swift and pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: mysterious messages pressure Lina toward a stance on the "quantum promise." Orientation is delayed—who, where, when emerge gradually through the first third—but the disorientation serves the glitchy, reality-seam premise and resolves by the bolt-turning beat. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Lina walks into the desert with the diamond, refusing further engagement with the messages, her final stance crystallized by the cost of bleeding and the conceptual unthreading. The cost is felt (blood, severed loop) and the image reweights the pressure/diamond premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when she twists the bolt and the farm reality fractures, forcing her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through recurring motifs (standing waves, the crank handle, golden light) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias recognizes the room itself as ledger, shifting from seeker to bridge-crosser. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. Cost is legible in the foreclosure of his "dynasty ender" identity, though the final image of writing "for the next" pushes some consequence forward rather than fully paying it on the page, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the knight steps onto the stage, ending his withdrawal with the dark as audience, and the final image crystallizes his new stance. Cost is present but largely implied through metaphor (strings going taut, sky mending) rather than a legible forfeiture of a prior option. The causal chain from gauntlet-unsealing to voice to stage-entry holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the middle escalation is driven more by atmosphere and figurative language than by a tightening choice that narrows lived options. Orientation is clear early (knight, greenhouse, siege backstory).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, archival fragments, and the button accumulate meaning until the mailing scene reweights Elias's role from passive recorder to active agent. Orientation anchors (file room, Elias's role, Daniel's emancipation date) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elias opens Maria's file "already scanning for the gaps," crystallizing his new stance—archivist as interventionist—with the cost implicit in his commitment to repeat this labor. One meaningful deepening (the button discovery → genealogical research → mailing) narrows options from passive documentation to active kindness. Causality holds throughout; no convenience plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena walks away from the booth, the fight repositioned to "the cracks," with the stolen ledger representing visible cost and the final image ("She didn't answer this time. / But she listened") reconfiguring her stance from reactive to patient architect. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (key, booth, puddles, names) that converge at closure. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Lena, lagoon, tonight). One meaningful deepening occurs when the booth reveals the archive location, narrowing her options and raising cost. The mosaic structure (lagoon night → morning broadcast → diner → years later) teaches its pattern early and maintains coherent pressure to the final static-listening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning, but closure ambiguity undermines cohesion: the protagonist "hushed" the prophecy, yet it hums within him and he returns—no decisive change or visible cost reconfigures options on the page. The slip of paper reveal ("in his own handwriting") gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but remains cryptic rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation is delayed (the prophecy's content and the protagonist's goal remain vague until the second paragraph; spatial anchors are impressionistic), though the lyric mode mitigates this. The cycle structure (grotto → departure → return) lacks a meaningful tightening; the second visit replicates the first without escalation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The story anchors who (Liora) and where (floating arbor) early; when (the hush) is abstract but atmospherically consistent. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the moonstone speck unfolds, monuments dissolve, arbor transforms into grove—density increases and the final image (Liora sorting saplings, understanding every leaf-word) reconfigures her role with a shift in capability. However, cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (role deepening) but the price—what she gives up to become arbor-keeper—remains oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs (speck → key → transformation ladder) under the lens, meeting minimum scope.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: objects and images (clock, compass, leaves, waterfall) recur with shifting weight until the final repurposing. Orientation anchors (tinkerer, workshop, boneyard greenhouse, cavern) land within the first fifth. The closure—stripping a gear to free the compass needle, then sketching a new timepiece—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing his shift from fixing to improvising. Cost is visible: he stops winding the clock, releases the last gear. One meaningful deepening occurs when the waterfall's question prompts his realization. Minor slip: the middle waterfall scene feels like a convenient oracle rather than a tightening born of prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Liora in the foundry after the search party leaves. The piece follows an Accumulative lens—density builds through Veyra's echoes (coin, vial, kintsugi method) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora accepts the weight as her own. The vial memory and coin transmutation supply the closure unit with felt cost (she carries the vial, begins her own work). One small slip: the workshop epilogue ("she'd transmute herself") partially re-explains the closure already landed, diluting the prior image's finality.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (laughter, crocodile's tooth, harp, petals) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration where the soul is integrated rather than released, fulfilling the "integration" premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without confusion. The closure reconfigures the collector's method—some souls need joy stitched back—and the harp's unaligned strings harmonize without correction, a clear before/after. Cost is felt but oblique: the soul's contentment and Liora's lighter satchel suggest relief rather than sacrifice, and no live option is visibly foreclosed for the protagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs when Liora shifts from release to integration, sufficient for this length, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the forest pilgrimage accumulates pressure through sensory intensification and the basin vision, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the strap snapping, light bending gold, hands no longer shaking). The cost is legible—penance paid through physical and psychic ordeal—and the "spaces between numbers" motif reweights at closure. Orientation anchors (ultraviolet forest, post-anesthesia timeframe, Liran alone) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the basin rips open and the interrogator's sewn-shut mouth articulates the failed expectation, tightening the thematic stakes before the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lior is and what she seeks emerge gradually, but "translator" and "alchemist's market" anchor by ~15% and the lens holds Accumulative/Textural throughout. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lior crystallizes her stance ("no longer just a bridge... the hand that reached into the between") and the final star image reweights her lifelong search. Cost is conceptual—she commits to carrying unfinished stories—but the passage "Some stories weren't meant to be finished. They were meant to be carried" states theme rather than dramatizing a forfeited path or visible price. The textural deepening (market swaying, lens humming, painter's booth empty) accumulates density, but the turn from seeking to embodying feels asserted more than causally earned by prior on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias's observations drive investigation, which leads to discovery, which prompts the unmaking decision. Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening. The closure—Elias dismantling the mechanism to free the ghosts—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghosts gain release, the circus is truly ended) with visible cost (the mechanism destroyed, the child's laugh shattered). One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the cracks are seams, narrowing his options from repair to unmake. The cost is legible in "The child's laugh in the pendulum shattered" and the finality of "Silence rushed in, thick and final."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear lens (Accumulative/Textural: the whisper's release and library's dissolution reweight the premise) and delivers an on-page Conceptual Repricing—Elias moves from containing whispers to freeing them, with the library's shattering and his dissolution marking cost. However, the closure cost reads as abstract starlight rather than a felt price: no specific capability, relationship, or lived consequence is forfeited on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough; one meaningful deepening occurs when Elias understands "the system wasn't the world. It was him," though this pivot is asserted rather than discovered through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands on the page: Elias achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the vision forces Taelis and the archaeologists to carry "uneasy knowledge," and he himself reconciles with time's beauty. The shard's destruction is a visible cost, and the dispute resolution is legible. However, the causal chain suffers from a gap: the mechanism by which the shard "twisted" time-strands and reconstructed the cathedral for three breaths is asserted rather than earned through prior demonstration or established rules, weakening the because/therefore link at the pivotal beat. The Drive Lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture; the ending honors both, but the unexplained mechanics at the climax pull it back from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, resonance chamber, dusk arrival) land early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered revelation (music box → chip → covenant → hunger → reclamation) and culminates in a cadence shift where Elias "unwinding something older" triggers the chamber's transformation and his erasure. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final gear "humming a tune no one recognized" reweights repair as ending, and the cost (Elias consumed by light) is conceptually legible. One tightening occurs when the stone's hunger sharpens to "give it back" and Elias chooses sacrifice. Closure lands on the page with felt cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias withdraws his hand, burns his father's notes, and abandons delving—each action foreclosing a path with on-page cost. The Accumulative lens (signaled by the layered objects: compass, vials, factory ruins, lagoon) holds throughout; the final image reweights petrichor (beginning) against silence (acceptance of non-explanation). Orientation anchors at the rusted catwalks within the first ~80 words. One tightening: wading deeper → touching the arch → water's reverse fall → father's voice → choice to drop hand. Cost is legible in the burning and the shift to "collecting silence."

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. The archway functions as a loom where past and present hands converge; the lantern slide's "layered meanings" and Elias's carving create a pattern that deepens rather than causally narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the storm shifts, the path "unspools," and Elias walks forward with a new understanding of connection across time. Cost is oblique—he loses the slide and GPS but gains direction—yet the final image of slipping driftwood into the woman's pocket reweights the opening stake (reaching Port Veyra) into a recursive act of guidance. One meaningful deepening is present, though the transition from mystical revelation to pragmatic path-finding could be more causally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (pavilion, Liora, winter melting) within the opening and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (postcards, murals, glass, flowers) and culminates in a cadence shift when Liora stops painting and writes a postcard, marking a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she stops seeking and embraces listening). Cost is felt in her renunciation of painting and the acceptance of transience ("The murals would fade"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass reveals preserved flowers, reweighting her obsession. Minor slip: the middle section loops through similar observations without a sharp turn that narrows options, relying on accumulation rather than a decisive pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (zeppelin, Elias, obsidian lagoon). The story accumulates pressure through diary fragments and visions, then offers a parley-via-shells reversal and a symbolic release of pages into the lagoon. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the past released, weight lifted), but the cost is asserted metaphorically ("lighter now") rather than shown as a specific forfeited option or price. The officers retreat without dramatized consequence, and Elias begins "a new ledger" with no visible obstacle, softening the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly: alchemist, cove ruins, amber bottle by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sensory density (cinnamon, charred meat, laughter) builds until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the town "conceived" rather than resurrected), but cost remains oblique: the bottle rolls away as "unnecessary," and the alchemist turns toward work without a felt forfeiture on the page. One meaningful deepening (past as blueprints, memory as crucible) tightens the stake, satisfying length expectations, yet the final cost is more conceptual than viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the wax shaving ritual accumulates meaning through memory, voice, prophecy, and final burial. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias chooses *not* to record the prophecy but to bury it, forecloses hubris, and commits to listening—a renunciation with conceptual cost legible in "the garden would remember. And Elias? He would listen." One meaningful deepening tightens the stake when the voice names him "the hinge," reweighting his role. The piece does not require causal reversals under this lens, and the ending image ("the garden would remember") recharges prior material with cost felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (egg hatching, ice cracking, roots erupting) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chick transforms and Liora gains a new cap with visible cost (the vortex's temporary defeat, the inheritance continuing). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (atrium, frost, Liora). The closure lands on-page with felt cost—she knows the vortex will return, but she has discovered "the texture of borrowed time" and secured one small victory. One slight artificiality: the vortex's mechanics shift conveniently to allow reversal exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is on-page and legible: Elias's reweaving of the rope allows the bell to "speak" rather than scream, the valley gains warning time, and the final toll confirms the fix—Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis (he preserves the warning system with visible cost of recklessness and solitary labor). Orientation anchors quickly (storm siren tester, sanctuary belfry, solstice eve). Causality is clean: glue dried → test → aftertone warps → rewove bindings → clean note → storm hits → bell tolls true. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (wind/listening motifs recur), held through closure. One meaningful tightening: the discovery of warped resonance forces immediate action with minutes to spare.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring star/light imagery, culminating in the lantern's restoration and station's transformation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the station "learned to breathe," Eli becomes "witness"), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical alteration on the page. The star's "waiting" and subsequent merge with Eli advances through coincidence (the star chooses him) rather than protagonist agency. Orientation is clear early; the two-shard structure (station routine → meteor shower night → departure) holds, but the middle deepening lacks a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (beekeeper, ruined oasis, post-vanishing timeframe) arrive early. The ghost arrival and box-opening constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights the covenant; the coda (oasis blooming, beekeeper gone) delivers Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise as his departure and the handprint crystallize cost and continuity. Felt cost: his absence, the ghosts' shift from regret to naming. One slip: the long coda risks diffusing the closure beat's immediacy, though the handprint image anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early. The closure unit—Elias winding the watch and understanding the silo as loom—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing), but the cost is oblique: what path does he foreclose? The piece accumulates symbols (urn, watches, garage-sale objects, scratched messages) toward a thematic reweighting, yet the final image ("There was work to do") gestures at stakes without dramatizing what Elias risks or loses. The accumulation is purposeful, but the cost at closure remains conceptual and not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with cadence shift at closure. The piece anchors quickly (poet, lagoon, post-rain) and accumulates pressure through collecting/tending beats (feather, kite, winding string) that deepen the incompletion motif. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the poet's refusal to capture the water's shiver and his final line "coming undone" reweight all prior gathering with acceptance of fraying. The cost is conceptual—ceasing to stitch—and the final smile signals stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening present; the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through layered images—copper, wire, diary, sapling—and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to Earned Stasis): Elira's death mid-conversation with the sapling crystallizes her devotion, and Tomas's adoption of the copper wire reweights the orchard's future with visible cost (years of work). Orientation anchors (Elira, orchard, terminal illness) arrive early. The western-quadrant sapling sequence tightens options (elders want it uprooted; she binds it anyway), and the ending's "wrapping copper around his wrist" image reconfigures the premise—respect earned by bending—without stating a moral. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara at the tower base after the signal). The closure is a Decisive Change (she touches the galaxy and departs), but the cost remains abstract—her empty lab is told in retrospect rather than dramatized as a lived trade-off in the moment of choice. The causal chain is present (signal → path → tower → terminal question → touch) but the escalation relies heavily on atmospheric accumulation rather than narrowing options; the terminal's questions don't constrain her tactics, they invite. The figure's appearance and the sculptures rearranging feel like coincidental enablers rather than pressure that forces her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coachman's nightly ritual builds density through recurring images (seed pods, birds, jetty) toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit is dilated across multiple paragraphs and then leaps to "years later," diffusing the on-page cost into retrospective summary. The orientation is clear early (coachman at jetty, post-battlefield), but the piece violates the two-shard default by traversing jetty → Gloom Hill → return to jetty → distant future without teaching a mosaic pattern by the 25% mark. The final image ("the garden would remain") offers Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in the coachman's present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. Orientation anchors arrive early (scrapyard, Rook, phonograph cylinder). A meaningful tightening occurs when Rook finds the dome and enters, but the closure effect is atmospheric rather than a legible reconfiguration with visible cost: "finally understood" and "let the dark take him" assert transformation without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid on the page. The cylinder's voice and the vines guide him, reducing protagonist agency at the pivotal beat. One transition (scrapyard to fissure) is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early through layered imagery (compass rose, sketch, anomaly) and builds density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "Home" shifts from place to direction. The Orientation Test is satisfied by paragraph two (who, where, when anchored). Cost is legible in Lira's physical leap and the station's emptiness afterward, fulfilling Charged Poise requirements. One minor causal slip: the anomaly's shift from external to internal ("wasn't out there—it was in here") occurs through assertion rather than dramatized discovery, creating a micro-gap in motivated progression.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: violet sun, wrong sky, and ice spire seed atmosphere that deepens through the swap, name-reveal, and sky-mending closure. Orientation anchors quickly (spire, wrong sky, Lirien scaling). The closure—sky mending, first right star, spire singing—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: the world begins to heal but Lirien steps into the unknown with only promises. One mild causality gap: the Keeper's instant capitulation after seeing his name feels under-motivated, compressing the turn that should test Lirien's thesis about doors and keys.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    The orientation test fails: by ~120 words, "who, where, when" remain unclear—Liora's present stakes and the penumbra's threat are abstract until well past the opening third. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing (silence defeats the penumbra), but the causal chain is metaphorical rather than dramatized—no on-page action earns the penumbra's retreat. The "wings" that emerge from the chessboard and the penumbra's withdrawal lack motivating links; the resolution relies on thematic assertion ("silence... the one thing the dark could never digest") rather than earned causality. Apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the rule.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric scaffolding. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the bookstore-as-mountain metaphor is taught and sustained. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elias commits to writing the glyphs, sealing the door behind him, foreclosing his former refusal). The cost is legible—"Some doors were meant to stay closed. Others were meant to be built"—and the final image of writing glyphs as seeds delivers felt weight. Minor causality seam: the false wall vanishes after he folds a page into a seed, but the mechanics of that trigger remain opaque, creating a small convenience leap.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of images and pattern recurrence reweights the dominant stake. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis plus thematic repricing via the board and tapestry)—cost is felt in his renunciation of winning and acceptance of the scars. Orientation anchors arrive late (village, labyrinth, tapestry all float without spatial grounding until mid-story); apply −0.4 once here and cap Q3 at 7.0. The tapestry-mending and board-reset feel like parallel gestures rather than a single causal turn, diluting closure sharpness. One tightening (kneeling at the labyrinth core) narrows options, but the mechanics of how decoding threads unfreezes the village remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (bone towers, mist, echoes) and Liora's counter-ritual that releases buried confessions. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire shatters, the canyon "would remember now," and she begins to carve openly, reweighting the premise of absolution with visible communal cost (elders' screams, mist swallowing them). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One weakness: the phrase "refract through the ritual's light" in backstory is vague, and the mechanics of how her carved words trigger the cascade remain slightly abstract, but the final image reconfigures the social order with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches a pattern of layered images (pockmarks, keys, kintsugi motif) and the final "step forward" operates as Charged Poise—options crystallize and the alchemist's endurance forecloses retreat with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, statue) arrive early and hold. The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost (workshop dissolves, alchemist steps into the statue's invitation), and the lens remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the third key turns and the statue opens, reweighting all prior repair work into a choice to "become the gold." Minor causality slip: the statue's sudden animation and the mechanics of "stitching themselves into the story" read more as metaphor than dramatized event, which slightly obscures the before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear: painter, post-mirror-crack timeframe, coastal village. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered grief, memory, and the seashell's evolving charge until the cave exhale and final leap reconfigure Elias's relationship to time and loss. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Decisive Change): the jump is on the page, the cost (leaving the living world) is legible, and the final image reweights the promise. One tightening—entry into the cave—narrows options meaningfully. The structure holds across two locations (quay, cave) without disorientation, and the ellipsis between burning paintings and the leap is bridged by thematic continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from needing the cork as proof to embodying the whisper himself, with visible cost (the cork's work is done; now he must tend the metaphorical garden). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern, density increase, and cadence shift reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boats turn, then Harkin's recognition crystallizes the shift from proving to embodying intent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and teaches a pattern of lunar cycles, phone calls, and map-building that accumulates toward the final image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the weight in her chest felt lighter" and "the maps weren't just directions, but anchors" reweights her navigation project with felt cost (years of solitary work, the ache in her ribs). The cost is legible and the cadence shift from isolation to connection lands cleanly. One tightening—tonight's call moves from riddles to "the way back"—narrows her stance from passive recording to active guidance, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure is Earned Stasis—Lior buries the eye, refusing revelation's blade, with visible cost (renunciation of power/cure). The warlord's men provide a micro-turn that tests his occlusion tactic; burial then forecloses the eye's use permanently. Orientation is swift (kneeling forager, post-virus valley, ravine orchard). One escalation beat (men arrive, he deceives) tightens to final renunciation. Cost is on-page and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes accumulative/textural mode clearly: pattern is taught early via fragments (the flower, the log, the stranger's eyes), and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Elias "lets the light do the rest," reweighting the premise of memory-keeping with felt cost (the boutonnière crumbles, the memory is "finally free"). Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The accumulation tightens through investigation beats and the saltwater steeping, but the central turn—understanding that memories are passed vessels—arrives via summary reflection rather than through a dramatized choice that narrows options, weakening escalation under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (Elias, cavern, creek rising). The piece follows a causal lens: chip glows → Elias follows → ants guide → door opens → choice made. One meaningful tightening occurs when the creek's roar forces the decision, and closure lands on-page with visible cost (door seals, path chosen). The woman's reappearance at the house, however, introduces a convenience that undercuts causality—her presence was not set up as a live possibility, and the framed map with wet ink feels like a thematic flourish rather than an earned turn. Cost is visible (he walks away from his shop life), but the final image's logic wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (queen, ridge, after dawn warning) land early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: violet fireflies, starlight pooling, childhood memory, and the final transformation build density and shift cadence to reweight the dominant stake (escape from mortality/throne). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation with visible cost: throne abandoned, kingdom bereaved). The cost is legible on the page ("her throne draped in cobwebs, her crown melted"), and the pattern holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the childhood bargain surfaces, narrowing her options and reframing the climb as fulfillment rather than discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the shell's meaning reweights from vessel to key to promise across beats, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when they jump "through" the moment and the shell's light weaves into their bodies. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure image—footsteps "revaluing the streets," shadows "scientifically romantic"—reconfigures the premise, but the cost remains abstract; I cannot point to a single sentence where a concrete price is paid or a live option foreclosed. The Accumulative lens holds, but cost legibility at closure is elusive.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the scroll's shifting glyphs and recursive time structure build density toward a pattern break when Younger burns it and Older steps outside to an empty grave. Orientation anchors (mountain cabin, Elias, post-grave timeframe) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis turning to release): trembling hands steady, grave empties, he soars—cost is the relinquishing of the chronicler role with visible consequence (ash, empty grave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scroll is burned and the cycle breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the first graf (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: morning fog → woman arrives → Elias interprets the screw → woman leaves → Elias returns to clock work, with thematic density increasing through layered reflection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the epiphany that "time wasn't something to be repaired… it was something to be read"), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or change in tactics on the page. The inferred lens holds, yet the final image (winding the clock, fog lifting) reweights prior material without dramatizing a felt price, leaving closure in mid-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (floating platform, post-storm mist, Lian with quill) land within the first 120 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (rune carving, quill shedding, scar transformation) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lian's scars "sang" and she steps into the storm ready "not to hide, but to write its name upon the wind." The closure unit—Charged Poise plus decisive renunciation of fear—lands on the page with felt cost (the quill's crystalline tip warm in her pocket, scars no longer aching). One meaningful deepening occurs when the rune for *unbinding* flares and the quill sheds its tip, narrowing her path from fear to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening lines; no penalty applies. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: perfume magic weaves through archive and orchard, building density until the final image of saplings and the humming pavement reweights the apology motif. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the trees fall, yet the earth and the characters remember the current, and the empty vial becomes a talisman of reconnection. Cost is visible—the orchard is destroyed, the apology required magical expenditure, and both characters must plant anew—but the final paragraph's explanatory framing ("She never told them…" / "Some metaphors were better left unsolved") partially externalizes what the prior image already conveyed, slightly diluting immediacy. One meaningful tightening occurs when the perfume's tendrils drag up "every unsent letter" and Elias admits pain, narrowing the path to mutual planting.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, when coalesce only after extended metaphysical description, though the disorientation is somewhat purposeful. The closure unit (dictionary dissolution, threshold crossing, tree appearance) reads as Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: the "weight" lifts without visible forfeiture on the page. The spiral arbitration is named but never constrains a tactic or decision; causality remains decorative. One meaningful deepening occurs (tearing the dictionary), but the reversal lacks earned setup—no prior beat establishes why this act would succeed where others failed.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texturing. The counting ritual, wavering horizon, ship manifestation, key-turns, and Elias's release form a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he releases the key, accepting his role as gatekeeper with the price visible in the new notch and his smile, foreclosing the path of intervention. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ship breaches and the woman grabs his wrist, forcing the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural building to a Situational crystallization) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors are present early (library, midsummer, post-heart-attack timeframe). The closure—Lila walking into the light after choosing not to choose—qualifies as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes her stance shift from calculated safety to embracing contradiction, and the cost (leaving her father's certainty model, stepping away from the hospital vigil) is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when she lights the lantern the second time and refuses binary choice. The cryptic scrawls function as complication rather than resolution, consistent with Situational allowances.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (wrong numbers, glass disc, teaching endings) and pays it off through cadence shifts and a final image that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the caller cries and Elias lets her, then offers "Try again tomorrow"—a tightening that forecloses immediate resolution. Cost is felt but oblique: the caller's ongoing struggle and Elias's perpetual vigil both carry opportunity cost, visible in "Same time" and "waited." Closure is Charged Poise plus light Conceptual Repricing: the final image ("courage to try the number again") reconfigures the loop from repetition to ritual with undeniable pressure, though the price remains more atmospheric than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through ink, violets, locket, and covenant fragments, building to a final image where the jetty "would bloom again" and "the covenant was breathing." Closure reads as Charged Poise—the archivist's ritual reconfigures her stance from steeping loss to weaving it forward, with the cost felt in her solitary labor and the covenant's incompleteness. Orientation anchors (walnut-ink archivist, jetty, twilight) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she whispers the old words and the harbor answers, crystallizing her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens with mosaic structure (station arrival, town interactions, Carter discovery, departure). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena's final realization that motion itself may be the cure reweights the quest premise. The cost is conceptual—she abandons ownership of the rock and acceptance of perpetual transit—and the image of someone else picking up the rock charges the ending. One structural slip: the virologist-to-forger reveal feels like a convenience pivot rather than earned misdirection.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered imagery (ultrasonic forest, musical languages, platinum ring) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the stillpoint clearing. Closure form is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Elian kneels, the melody rises, his grief is "mapped," and he carries the stillpoint within. Cost is conceptual (grief defined, path chosen) but never made viscerally felt on the page; the "quiet blaze" remains abstract. Orientation is clear early (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, paused constellations). The primary weakness is that the stillpoint's discovery unfolds without meaningful resistance or tightening—he walks, the music stops, he finds the bone, the forest exhales—so the accumulation lacks a decisive pressure point before the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the anomaly, pen, and vellum accumulate symbolic weight until the final decision to "plant again" reweights Elias's prior mistake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final image crystallizes his stance without on-page action but with conceptual cost (accepting layered imperfection). Orientation is clear by paragraph three. The causal linkage is loose—transmission produces words, words shift perspective—but under the Accumulative lens, the pattern-break (words appearing before writing, anomaly shivering in response) suffices. Cost is implied rather than viscerally legible: Elias walks toward the bays, but we do not see what he sacrifices or risks on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is immediate (harbor, moon, two characters), and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the harbor's glow dims, then the waves rise in luminous color. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the camera "heavier now, like a heart full of names"—but the cost is metaphorical rather than felt in a forfeited path or altered tactic. The faceless stranger appears and dissolves without prior setup, weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and the final burning reconfigures the promise's meaning with felt cost. However, orientation is delayed—who Elias is and his exact situation emerge gradually through the first third without clear anchoring. The closure lands (he destroys the ledger to foreclose weaponization) but the causal chain depends on summarized backstory rather than on-page choices narrowing options. One meaningful deepening occurs but causality feels loose.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and what by the opening paragraph (Lira at the lagoon, experimental treatment subject). Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens: the memory-release and the garden's shift from dirge to lullaby reweights her stance from vault to freed self. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt—"The doctors would call this a relapse" signals consequence but never dramatizes risk or price on the page. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but the final image ("her heart finally quiet," "dreams…found their way home") asserts resolution without showing what she sacrificed or what will happen next.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece establishes a situational lens (storm scrambles compasses, woman offers challenge, Lior navigates quietly), but causality weakens when the coin suddenly unlocks a portal without prior setup of its mechanics. The closure unit reads as a Charged Poise moment—Lior steps through an invitation with the labyrinth's whispers as his "second skin"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a concrete choice or forfeiture. The final paragraph's reflection ("wondered if the real challenge wasn't leaving…but staying") dilutes the closure image rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardian's work is complete, the boy's tension eases, and she returns to her post with visible cost (continued isolation, waiting). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—patterns of light, shutters, and mirrored stars build density until the boy's shoulders ease and he walks away steadier. One meaningful deepening: the boy's realization that "darkness wasn't the absence of stars—it was the space that let them shine" shifts his stance with felt cost (relinquishing the crumpled note, facing his father). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (cobalt dock, canal, guardian, dental mirror).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric fragments, synchronized displays as mounting pressure) and the closure lands as Charged Poise—the library is saved, but the grotto's pulse and "something hungry" in the windows signal an ongoing, unresolved force. Cost is legible: the council's capitulation is haunted by the grotto's autonomy ("the game was far from over"). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (cobalt library, mist, Elias). One meaningful tightening occurs when the workers lower their tools, narrowing the council's options. The lens holds through the ending without contradiction, and the final image reweights earlier motifs (pawn, grotto pulse, unspoken chorus) with felt unease.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's dive and the island's dissolution crystallize his transformation with visible cost (leaving the land, the dockworkers, his former identity). The accumulative/textural lens holds through the whale's call, the scrimshaw's vibration, and the final swim. Orientation is established early (Elias, Veyth docks, post-war present). One meaningful tightening occurs when the scrimshaw answers the whale's call and Elias unfolds. However, the island-as-cage revelation arrives very late without prior setup, weakening causal groundwork; the mechanics of "Veyth had never been an island. It was a cage" feel like a rule introduced to resolve rather than constrain.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands clearly: Lena's scream releases the stasis, and the next-morning whittling-lesson offer reweights "carrying grief" from passive clutching to active making—Earned Stasis with visible cost (the burned tin, the shared bouquet fragment). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases from objects (bouquet, tin, knife) to actions (scream, burn, teach) to the final "choice not absence, a remaking" cadence shift. Orientation is prompt (turbines, porch, Mandate context by paragraph five) and the single-scene window holds. One beat—standing on the rail, the scream—tightens pressure decisively before the closing beats reweight the dominant stake (how to hold grief). Minor gap: the happiness-tin burn feels convenient rather than causally prepared, shaving the top edge.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, when by opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral walk builds through sensory layering and motif recurrence (hum, quartz, ice) toward a final image that reweights the ban and the atrium's purpose. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the lake thaws, the atrium "unfolds," and the elders' fear is reframed—with felt conceptual cost (heresy, transformation). The cost is legible in "The elders would call it heresy" and the physical act of the ice fracturing, though the emotional price remains oblique. One tightening: her realization that "the ban had never been about keeping them out" shifts tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered plant-language, concertina exchanges, and the phoenix frame, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's playing and Liora's hand-squeeze crystallize shared language and acceptance. The closure lands with felt cost (he "didn't need to see," accepting his colorblindness as irrelevant to beauty). Orientation is clear by ~100 words. Deduction: the old woman's double-painting demand arrives without prior constraint, reading more as whimsy than earned price; the phoenix's "seventh year" cycle is decorative and doesn't tighten options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (laboratory, post-grid stabilization, Liora with lens) by ~10% and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: hum → voice → path → bell left behind. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lens creates the "sound of between," and closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she stops searching, leaves the bell). However, the cost is conceptual and asserted ("she was no longer searching") rather than felt through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The Mosaic structure (power grid opening, lens experiment, bell creation, departure) is legible but the accumulation relies heavily on metaphor rather than causal narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated crane-folding, coordinate-placing, and vein-tattooing until the winter coda reweights the dominant stake (solitary mourning → communal teaching). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Lena's new practice forecloses solitary grieving with visible cost (the tattooed arm, the open curtains, the stranger's trembling smile). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from making lilies to cranes, then to teaching others. The cost is legible: she has opened herself and her space to strangers, embodying vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who and where early (loft, Elias, post-crash), but the temporal window remains diffuse—"since the collapse" offers context without immediate pressure. A single visitor arrives, confides, receives advice, and leaves; the sequence accumulates atmosphere but lacks a decisive causal tightening or turn that narrows options. The ending reconfigures meaning (truth as a shape recognized in rain-streaked glass, the next reading for culture itself) but the cost is conceptual and oblique; the Orientation Test penalty does not apply, yet closure feels more thematic echo than felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening lines. The piece establishes an accumulative lens: the historian approaches the archive, interacts with the pagoda, and receives a vision that leads to release. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (letting go after witnessing the civilization's lesson), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture of a live option or relationship is legible. The pagoda's "crumbling into light" and the archive sealing feel symbolic rather than causally consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the stone, footage, and shadow material layer toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Liora's shadow-trade crystallizes the library's purpose with felt cost. Orientation anchors (floating library, Liora, stone on desk) land within the first 120 words. The closure—Liora becoming "part of the library now—a keeper of shadows"—reconfigures her role with visible cost (thinned shadow, forfeited autonomy) and the final image ("stone glowed once, like a heartbeat, then stilled") charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the unbound shadow seeks a vessel and Liora offers hers, narrowing options with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the three-layer ritual (salve, tincture delivery, letters) that deepens Elias's stance. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Elias stepping forward with sleeves rolled crystallizes a reconfigured stance with felt cost (the weight of ongoing penance, not absolution). One minor slip: the apothecary silence and Mara subplots add texture but don't tighten options causally, so escalation reads more as accretion than narrowing—still valid under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of image-layering (hourglass, scar, coffee rings, dandelion, archive) that reweights "displaced miracle" and "wound as story" across beats. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora renounces decoding in favor of carrying, and the hourglass runs out, marking a felt passage from seeking to accepting. Cost is conceptual—she forecloses interpretation—but the final image ("tower stood quiet, its wounds finally allowed to stay open") makes the price legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fern's memory shifts "displaced miracle" from abstract to embodied. Orientation is clear by paragraph two (tower, post-surgery, dawn). No causality breaks; the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors POV, location, and goal by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered psychometry readings that reweight the stake from "find goodbye letters" to "recognize stored love within herself." The final image—turning off the projector and letting "the dark have its say"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she renounces the search), though the conceptual cost (accepting absence as presence) is more implied than concretely paid on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost legibility at closure remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (aurora-lit archway, astronomical instrument, Liora's cosmic pursuit). A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs: Liora transforms from listener to conduit, and the archway dissolves, leaving her with "stardust in her veins" and newfound creative power. However, the cost is abstract—"the doubt, the years of stifled sketches" are named but never dramatized as a trade-off in the closure beat. The escalation from stepping under the arch to singing and sketching equations lacks a causal tightening; the instrument "spins wildly" and "her hands moved on their own," reducing agency. The closure image ("You were always the key") asserts theme rather than landing a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (dunes, crate, clock, spark) and builds density through recurring images that shift meaning. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Hollow moves from emptiness to remembering, the sand turns green, tracks renew—cost is felt in the transformation from "never dreamed" to dreaming of forests. Orientation anchors (freight guard, train, glowing dunes) land within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when Hollow places the spark in the crate and winds the clock backward, altering the world's trajectory. The mosaic structure (multiple short shards) is legible and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, though some transitions blur without clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates images (gear, hum, forest) toward a density shift at closure. However, the Orientation Test fails—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words; the philosopher is unnamed, the forest's reality status unclear, and "after the sixth sense awakened" provides no concrete anchor. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing (frontier internalized, gear left behind), but cost is asserted ("no longer needed to wander") rather than shown with a visible forfeiture or constraint. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and −0.3 for abstract cost, then cap all categories at 8.3 per cross-cap rules.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Liora, the ridgeway, after her final crossing) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through layered images (ticket punch, vigil fires, star imprint) and the closure lands as Earned Stasis—Liora chooses to stay, forfeiting the crossing role with visible cost (releasing the punch into the shallows). One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the star into her palm, recognizing "the unused courage had been here all along, not in the crossing, but in the pause before it." The cost is legible on the page: she releases the tool that defined her identity, sits among the former guides, and accepts a new station.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear orientation (bellhop, cobalt fortress, third-floor landing) early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (silence, cold, nerve regeneration) build toward the final hum and note. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elias hands over the bolt and "stayed" as the first real note shakes the walls—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legibly forfeiting a specific path or relationship on the page. The causality is thin: the bolt's function as "key to rebuilding" the piano is asserted late without prior clues, and the pianist's return and Elias's decision hinge on symbolic logic rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors early: Veythas in the temple library, tracing a dragonhide tome, finding ink pellets with runes. The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture—three messages escalate the warning, the scepter-sundering is motivated by Veythas's recognition of Lirien's ink, and the pretender's relief confirms the false claim. Closure lands on-page: the scepter cracks "from the weight of a truth too long denied," the pretender admits he never wanted the throne, and Veythas carves the epitaph before walking out—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (Lirien's name, the kingdom's end). One potential slip: the mechanics of "whisper her name into the dark" as the sacrifice feel slightly abstract, though the subsequent shattering and carving demonstrate the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments assemble, the rhythm recurs, and the final road emergence reweights the entire station vigil. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena steps onto the submerged road, the atlas dissolves, and the station lights die—options crystallize with felt cost even as the outcome remains open. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (Lena, station, tide gauges, eleven years). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sonar line appears and the receded tide exposes the road, tightening her choice and foregrounding cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: hum → touch → light → collective ignition builds density and cadence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure lands with felt cost (the rebellion is no longer memory but shared breath, defiant liftoff), though the cost is atmospheric rather than individually visible. One meaningful deepening (stones remembered → collective reignition) is sufficient for this length, but the final beat's collective agency dilutes the protagonist's foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives clearly by the opening paragraph (Liora, hot springs, post-war Reconstruction). The closure unit—unsealing the amber and planting the new vine—lands on the page as a Decisive Change. However, causality weakens at the pivot: the kite's script "unfolding like a flower" and the whisper-vines' instruction feel like convenient prompts rather than earned discoveries. The Council's reversal (elder's boot touched by vine, then everyone kneels) collapses resistance without struggle, undercutting cost. Drive lens reads Causal with Situational coloring, but the because/therefore chain from kite discovery to unsealing skips mechanical work.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift: arboretum, Lena, grief from drone strike. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—layered sensory beats (wind, cypress, tide) and the photograph's release build toward the final pruning decision, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid: she accepts the weight as "something like roots" and commits to tending the living). The closure lands with felt cost: the empty pocket, the shift from holding grief to making room, the act of pruning as both literal and figurative. One tightening occurs when the child mistakes the photo for a bird, reweighting Lena's relationship to the image and enabling her to let it hang. The lens holds; no causality breaks. High-band entry secure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit—"she stepped into it...as the canvas"—offers reconfiguration through metaphor without legible cost on the page. The "redesign" action is told in summary ("began to redesign it...by untangling"), and the walls-closing timeframe never tightens a concrete decision. Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and why she is in the lighthouse remain vague past the first third, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture; the piece anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change: Kael moves from hunting a monster to following to understand, stepping through the ink threshold. Cost is legible in the act of crossing and the dissolving patterns behind him, though the realization that "the thief was hunting too" feels more asserted than discovered through dramatized action. The ink-as-door mechanism is set up early and paid off, and the final step-through narrows his options with finality.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The causal chain from letter → discovery of discrepancies → system flood → confrontation reads cleanly under a Causal lens. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (Elara dies, truth spreads) with visible cost on the page. The "Martyr" label and "archives spoke back" feel slightly assertive rather than dramatized, but the core reversal—silenced past given voice—lands with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently (Liora, dome, post-collapse), builds pressure through layered images (sandbag, knife, roses, fissure), and delivers Earned Stasis closure—Liora's refusal to flee, her commitment to tend the quiet, forecloses escape with palpable cost ("The world had fallen. She would weave it back together, one thorn at a time"). The cost is felt in her isolation and the fissure that "didn't spread. Neither did she." One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to patch the dome with the sandbag scrap, crystallizing her stance. No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates charged images—humming soil, sleepwalking stars, the goddess's mouth—toward a final cadence shift when the fisher releases his daughter's echo and the stars "stayed still." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist's refusal to turn when "a child's hand" brushes his sleeve forecloses the pursuit with felt cost. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening beat. One persistent pattern break (constellations sleepwalking → snapping into place → will sleepwalk again) tightens the central question and the ending image of mending nets under blackness charges prior material, though the midpoint transition from garden to dock lacks a clear temporal or spatial cue, slightly blurring continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clear by paragraph two (Lydia, observatory, after the journalist's call). The drive lens is Causal: journalist's challenge → ledger investigation → plates arrival → decision to publish, with each beat motivated by the prior. Closure is a Decisive Change—Lydia moves from potential complicity to breaking the orbit by committing to run the story—with visible cost (risking the paper's reputation and her father's memory). One meaningful tightening occurs when the plates arrive, narrowing her options and forcing the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara witnesses rather than silences, the cry continues, and she picks up a fresh needle—renunciation of erasure with visible cost (the discomfort persists). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery (amber, firmware, Pleiades, letters) accumulates pressure and the final cadence shift ("wings were singing," breath syncing) reweights the guilt-stake. Orientation is clear by ~100 words (lab, Elara, constellation tattoos). One meaningful deepening occurs in the time-fold return to the crib. Cost is legible in the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns, whispers, and the mandala deepen until the grotto's chorus and the final void-drawing create a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant—the mist "swallows the first line hungrily" and Lior accepts perpetual creation/destruction). Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "when" (the unlearning week) is contextual. The closure lands with conceptual cost (the void must be drawn again and again, "some things were meant to be devoured"), and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening—mandala splits, flake burns, hand plunges—reconfigures his relationship to the mess and the village.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through the ritual of naming tesserae, each stone a beat that deepens Elias's act of resistance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the commander joins, the stones glow, cracks fill with gold—the plaza becomes unforgettable, reweighting the fire's erasure with a communal act of memory. Cost is conceptual and social: defiance risked death, and the commander's participation forecloses his prior role. One meaningful deepening (the commander's arrival and capitulation) tightens the stakes. Orientation anchors early (plaza, post-fire, Elias kneeling, mosaic). The lens holds; the ending image recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~80 words ("Lydia had been dead for seventy-three years...the hedge maze behind the old theater"). The piece operates under a hybrid lens—accumulative texture building toward a situational moment when Elias stands—and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias pockets the pills and steps forward, reweighting his options. Cost is felt ("the boy stood, pocketed the pills") but remains oblique; the "echo of his heartbeat" and Lydia's awareness that he'll "forget this ever happened" suggest ephemerality rather than a sharp before/after with visible price. The fractured-timeline premise is declared but not causally active in narrowing Elias's or Lydia's tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and builds to a Charged Poise closure where Lena creates the door but does not yet step through, crystallizing her choice between illumination and pursuit with palpable pressure in the final image. The causal chain from static shock → sliver → somatic sequence → door is legible under a Causal/Hybrid lens, though the middle transition (from applying the sliver to completing the painting) compresses key beats into summary ("By the time the painting was finished"). The cost—Mira's absence, the dissolution of the sliver into Lena's skin—is felt but not fully dramatized in a way that narrows tactical options on the page before the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly by the third paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers cave imagery, fossil touches, and tech readouts toward a final moment of resonance. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lior becomes the cave's voice—but the cost is asserted ("amber, the hue of dawn") rather than felt. No on-page choice, renunciation, or forfeiture precedes the transformation, weakening the closure's punch.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors orientation early (warehouse, Elias, the jar of whispers) and builds toward a clear Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy is a choice, not a warning, and the buttons are pivot points for fate. Yet the final act—threading the button and leaving it as an offering—feels more symbolic than causally decisive; the hourglass turns itself backward, and the cliffs stand steady, but the mechanism and cost remain opaque. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the closure image doesn't fully reweigh prior material with undeniable pressure; we're told the hourglass sings and time flows backward without dramatized consequence or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal elements (Hybrid). Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lena pockets the key and steps toward the coordinates, crystallizing her commitment with felt cost (leaving the pillbox, ending her withdrawal). Orientation anchors are present early (Zephyr Bluff, mist, spring thaw). One meaningful deepening occurs when the pillbox opens and reweights her stance from hiding to action. Cost is legible in her departure and the discarded relic.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the coachman recognizes the needle as inherited duty and turns toward the next traveler) with visible cost (the girl dissolves upstream, the merchant's call ignored). The accumulative/textural lens holds: fog lifts twice, gutters slow then silence, pressure tightens through sensory density and the parchment's palimpsest logic. Orientation anchors (coachman, river crossing, fog) arrive within the first ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the second fog-lift triggers his decision, and the cost—generational obligation, solitary repetition—charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (potter, oasis, present moment signaled by chimney smoke). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (bee, glass, bowl, kiln) that converge at the closure moment when the potter leaves the glowing bowl in the ruins. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—"resistance wasn't refusal / It was remembrance"—with conceptual cost (he walks away, the bowl stays). One tightening is present (the glass embedded, the bowl fired, the bowl left behind), sufficient for this length, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors promptly: fire escape, harbor, moonlight, Lena alone with her pots. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Charged Poise closure—the two gauge teeth in the dirt and Lena's hum crystallize a shift from locked isolation to an open door without requiring a causal reversal. The cost is felt: she lets herself believe, a stance foreclosed before. One minor waiver: "the lockmaster vanished" is told rather than shown, a small causality gap that doesn't harm the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hum peaks, reflections multiply, the book appears and dissolves, feather absorbed—cadence tightens toward the door opening. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lior steps through previously sealed doors into "rain and possibility," the brittle awakening no longer hurting. Cost is legible in the renunciation of asking forgiveness and the acceptance of being "the ones who refused to stay dead." Orientation anchors early (brass sundial, tidal library, clouds below) and the accumulative beats cohere, though the mechanics of the stone circle and translator's hour remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors setting and character early, and the accumulative structure (arrival → installation → departure → dream → waking) coheres. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora moves from hoarding secrets to releasing them, and the final waking image with the found twig reweights the "thread" motif. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no legible forfeiture of a live option, no dramatized sacrifice. The "rejoining" occurs without friction; Liora never resists the artist or monk, so the arc feels like thematic unfolding rather than earned transformation. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the density does not meaningfully intensify or break pattern at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (Liora, radio station basement, present night). The piece operates under a Situational lens: external pressure (the signal, university fractures) forces Liora's stance crystallization. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she engages the signal, the community pauses, and her final choice to continue the dialogue reconfigures her status from outcast to participant with undeniable conceptual cost (defying the dean, risking further censure). One meaningful tightening occurs when the signal responds with "laughter" and then shifts to curiosity. Cost is felt in her isolation and the dean's search, though the exact price remains implicit rather than dramatized in a final forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors quickly (vault, Elias, lantern, compass). The compass-point action triggers the slab's opening, the descent leads to the chamber, and the key insertion resolves spatial mutiny—clear because/therefore linkage. Closure is Decisive Change: the blueprint "breathed" and rewrites the city, with cost visible in Elias's transformed relationship to fear and the compass now "warm as a pulse." One meaningful tightening (organ scream, walls shift, test) narrows options before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory detail, ritual action, and the echo's appearance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias speaks Liora's name aloud and accepts witness as his role. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost (he carries the sketch, the ribbon, the knowledge that justice won't reopen), and the final turn toward the child's cough reweights his earlier isolation. Causality is clean under the accumulative lens; the lance ritual and ribbon fragment drive the vision sequence, though the echo's mechanics remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The causal lens holds: the journal cipher drives Elias to the deck, the nail's hum motivates the press to glass, and the world-split/snap constitutes a decisive physical change. However, the closure cost—burning the journal and hearing "relieved laughter"—reads as a gesture toward emotional release rather than a visible forfeiture that alters Elias's options going forward. The final image "door, waiting" reconfigures the premise but the felt price is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, pullout, dusk, post-hitchhiker departure) arrive quickly. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and metaphoric layering build toward the final step-through, which functions as Charged Poise—options crystallize and Elias commits to the impossible road. The closure reconfigures the pullout from rest stop to threshold with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more atmospheric than concretely felt. One meaningful deepening (glass flake → door) is present, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint, anchors who/where/when within ~100 words, and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure: Elias walks away, accepting the train's placement and his own stillness. The cost—abandoning the forward momentum his father never could—is felt through the flicked cigarette and the shadow "unhurried across the tracks." One minor slip: the middle deepening (lion's cage, bent bars) adds texture but doesn't narrow options as sharply as the lens might allow, creating slight drift before the final cadence shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. The piece teaches its pattern early—shifting glyphs, variable stars as Morse-like signals—and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias moves from hoarding words to joining the shared chorus, reweighting his role with felt cost (the ledger vanishes, the telegram crumbles). Cost is legible in the line "the words he'd hoarded for years dissolved into the air, their weight lifting like smoke." However, the middle escalation is diffuse; the temple inscriptions "yield their meaning" without a specific on-page tightening that narrows options before the final shift. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (observatory, Elias, night sky, sister's vanishing).

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (wound-lake, orchard-remembering, vines-digesting-truth) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration when Eldrin pockets the key and walks away, a Charged Poise moment where silence wins with felt cost. The before/after is legible: he sought his brother and found a truth too heavy to pursue further. One meaningful deepening occurs when the plant devours the confession and rewrites Eldrin's understanding. Minor cost-proof issue: the "weight of knowing" is asserted more than shown in a concrete on-page consequence that alters his next move.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a single POV and teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (scars as compass, maze as loom). Closure arrives on the page: Liora becomes the covenant's keeper, her shadows no longer rooted, dreams intersecting with the world. However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—"the oldest scar had begun to bloom" suggests transformation but doesn't specify what path has been foreclosed or what tangible price she's paid. The encounter with future-Liora introduces a reversal ("You're early... not ready to be uneclipsed") that complicates but then resolves too smoothly. Under an Accumulative lens, the density increases and the final image reweights prior motifs, but the felt cost needed for high-band closure is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, Liora kneeling, tarot card) arrive within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (roots/bones/blossoms, repeated bartering motif) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Liora walks away lighter, her scars now hers to carry, a renunciation with visible cost (the white flower wilting, the past "in the earth now"). The tightening occurs when the roots coil and pull her deepest guilt, narrowing her to one choice: give it everything or resist. Cost is legible in the line "her hands empty but her eyes, for the first time, quiet" and the acceptance that holes remain "patchwork and uneven." The lens holds; closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liam accepts uncertainty as generative space rather than failure, foreclosing the need for external validation with felt cost (leaving appraisal certainty behind). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered callbacks (applause, silence, "after") and the final driving image reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (quarry trailer, Liam, present-day appraisal errand) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening: the grille-cloth discovery shifts his emotional calculus from hollow professionalism to quiet ownership. Cost is legible in the image of driving into unmarked dark, accepting the wait. Minor: the causal line from discovering the cloth to decisive internal shift relies heavily on accumulation rather than a single because/therefore hinge, which is acceptable under the chosen lens but leaves some escalation implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative atmosphere building toward a decisive physical act). The seed-planting and subsequent dimensional shift constitute an on-page Decisive Change, and the cost is legible in Elias's acceptance that this is "reestablishing" rather than undoing. One meaningful tightening occurs through the climb and invocation. The orientation is clean, and the closure lands; minor penalty for the slightly abstract framing of the resolution ("held now in a light that let him see both at once"), which borders on tell rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens with lyric patterning and symbolic objects. Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (tidal atrium), and when (after tomorrow vanished) within the first ~150 words, satisfying the test. The closure—Elias returning to work, the creel heavier with possibilities—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the premise and the creel's nature is clarified. However, the cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page. The woman's arrival and departure feel like a visitation rather than a causal turn that narrows Elias's options.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when are anchored by ~120 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the inspector walks toward the horizon, carrying shells with the intent to plant them, and the final image reweights the bunker as "womb" rather than refuge. Cost is conceptual (she rejects her assignment and spreads confessions) but not viscerally felt on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence shift reweights the premise, but the because/therefore linkage between pearl-absorption and world-change is abstract rather than causally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates graffiti fragments, map references, and bellows touches across two locations (station → bridge) with clear spatial and temporal anchors by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias moves from the station's reflective loop to the bridge, where squeezing the bellows and choosing to turn right crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he forgoes the mapped route, accepts the cost of not looking back). Cost is legible in "turned right" after the graffiti's brave/sorry fork and "didn't look back." No causality breaks; the sister's letter and fire backstory anchor his guilt without stalling present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational. The piece accumulates symbolic pressure through recurring motifs (watch, mist, letters) and a pattern-taught ellipsis style. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the dreamer reweights "unspoken" as something she must now speak, and posts the third letter with visible cost (leaving the watch behind). The orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph (veiled dreamer, library, mist), and the pattern is taught early enough for the mosaic shards to cohere. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second letter is posted and the library collapses, narrowing her window. The cost is legible—she forfeits the cipher and steps into vulnerability—but it remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives on the page: Elara destroys the violin, scattering fragments that root and sing—a Decisive Change with visible cost (contract breach, "thief, fraud, madwoman" labels). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: plant whispers, coffee-stain futures, and the violin's embedded voice layer until the smashing reweights empire versus dream. Orientation is swift (who, where, violin case by paragraph two). One friction: the "perforated destiny" language in the opening feels more decorative than mechanic until late; earlier constraint-signal would tighten causal confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (grotto, aurora, Liora's profession). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora receives the dead woman's message and commits to carrying it forward, reweighting her mortician practice. However, the cost remains oblique—no on-page sentence proves what she sacrifices or forecloses by this choice. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere and motif-laden), but the ending's reconfiguration is asserted more than demonstrated through a visible constraint or price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Sister Maren, grotto above clouds, post-forgiveness) land by ~120 words. The hairpin → shoot → silver fruit sequence accumulates symbolic charge and the final gift to the arsonist enacts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she converts grief into a future-facing cycle) with felt cost—she surrenders the heirloom and her own claim to closure. One meaningful deepening (plucking the shoot, dissolving into veins) reweights the stake. Closure is on-page and coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, weathered steps, dawn routine) land early. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shard whispers accumulate pressure, the cloak-unhooking sequence deepens through repetition, and the final image (beam as pulse, quilt from cloak) reconfigures the certainty premise with conceptual cost (dust settles, beam wavers). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse's function shifts from rigid guide to uncertain signal, reweighting the premise. One escalation issue: the woman's arrival introduces help without prior friction, softening the cost Elias pays alone.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pond-stone pattern recurs three times with deepening meaning, and the final step into the grotto offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. However, the closure cost remains oblique—"let the grotto's pull guide him downward" suggests surrender but no legible price or foreclosed path is dramatized. The trance reversal (sixty-three to sixty-two) occurs off-closure and does not reweight the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (canyon, bone towers, skimmer's position). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the skimmer crystallizes his stance ("He was the stone") and the threat passes, reconfiguring survival from motion to stillness. Cost is felt (renunciation of flight, endurance of proximity to predator) but remains conceptual; no on-page forfeiture or tactical alteration is legible in the final image beyond waiting. The flock's reform and the arrowhead cooling signal resolution, but the price paid is atmospheric rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the spire, mist-walking revelation, and keystone accumulate meaning through density increase and cadence shift. Orientation anchors (Marlin, spire, exam failure) arrive early. The closure effect is Conceptual Repricing—Marlin's refusal to explain and his whispered command reweight the premise (sacred vs. automated) with visible cost (he walks away, leaves the keystone). One meaningful deepening occurs when the folly reveals mist-walking and the keeper's lesson. Minor causality question: the keeper's presence and her knowledge of Marlin feel convenient rather than earned, though the pattern holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias, lamplighter) and where (pier, *Marigold* wreck) within the opening, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: lanterns, colors, sound, and the library accrue symbolic weight toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit—Elias lighting his own lantern and the figure dissolving—offers conceptual repricing (vows are shown, not spoken; sound-color is made) but the cost remains implicit and atmospheric rather than legible on the page. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (metronome boots, swinging lantern, rising sky lanterns) and pays it off with the final glow "threaded with hues he had no name for," but the causal link between finding the key, opening the door, and his choice to light a new lantern feels elliptical rather than motivated. The "vow Elias had just signed in silence" is asserted in summary, not shown as a decision that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered imagery (amber walls, static, coins) and a final cadence shift when Liora dissolves and the observatory resets. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the universe held at dawn rather than dusk), with conceptual cost legible in the backward journey and the implication that she has rewritten causality. Orientation anchors (suspended deck, Liora, dying stars) land early. The escalation is texture-driven rather than causal, consistent with the lens, and the ending reweights the prophecy motif with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates through density increase and pattern reinforcement (fears → crystallization → naming → release) with a final cadence shift that reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the reaper continues walking despite visible cost, forecloses any path toward stopping, and the final image of coiled shadow charges prior material. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (reaper, observatory, dusk). The tightening occurs through the naming ritual that transforms formless dreads into solid monsters, narrowing the reaper's world to one of perpetual sacrifice. Cost is legible: "something coiled. / Something newly named. / Something that had not forgotten." One persistent constraint—his hollowness and the atlas page tucked where his heart was—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost (bleeding fingers, three moons of study) and the drive lens reads as Causal/Accumulative hybrid—bell strikes trigger cascading physical effects that restore fish and hope. The orientation anchors (viaduct, dawn, Elias, bell, bay) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when synchronized drips validate his theory and fish return. The cost proof is present: "worked until his fingers bled" and "the weight of a vow kept."

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis refusal of silence → shared meaning): Elias releases the photographs, the reservoir gives back a vision of Old Hollow "whole and golden," and he walks away to record memory as a son rather than warden. Cost is visible—he drops the bottle, abandons his archive of grief—and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a clear cadence shift at the ridge-crest turn. Orientation is swift (warden, ridgeway, reservoir, twenty years) and the one transition (trail → crest → office framing) holds. Minor slip: "tonight, for the first time, he wanted to feed it. Not with silence" is a micro turn that could read as pivot rather than deepening, but the subsequent photograph sequence integrates it causally. The Charged Poise moment—reservoir giving back the vision—carries felt cost even if the social price (becoming storyteller) is deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece is legible as Accumulative/Textural: the alchemist performs a ritual, the orchard transforms, she steps through a door. Orientation anchors arrive early (hidden orchard, waterfall, alchemist). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she stops forcing wonder into formulas and accepts it—but the cost is conceptual rather than visibly paid on the page. The final paragraph tells us she "wouldn't resist," yet no prior scene dramatizes what she surrenders or forfeits in concrete terms. The shift from old world to new is vivid, but the price remains atmospheric rather than stakes-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a single-scene window and a coherent pressure arc toward Charged Poise at closure. The ending crystallizes options—secure the device, refuse communication—with felt cost (perpetual solitude, unseen heroism). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. The radio message and descent sequence demonstrate motivated progression. One escalation tightening when she "stepped into the dark" forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in "some burdens weren't meant to be shared" and the final image of her walking alone.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Kael at the dojo with two brain jars and Veyra's arrival. The piece operates under a Causal lens—Schism created the split, custody battle threatens dissolution, blood ritual merges the brains, Emperor's timeline stops rewriting—with one meaningful tightening (the merge decision) that forecloses the custody path. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (jars dissolve, Kael feels whole, world no longer chained). The history-rewriting timeframe adds situational pressure but remains slightly abstract; the link between Kael's merge and the valley's echoes stopping reads more thematic than causally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (tunnel beneath household), and the ritual clearly. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the tunnel symphony accumulates meaning through lyric repetition until real laughter breaks the pattern, reweighting Elias's project. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias hears real laughter, lowers the blower, and climbs to the surface, with the hourglass "finally full" repricing his prior effort. Cost is legible but soft: he abandons the ritual, yet no visible forfeiture or trade-off sharpens the moment—he simply joins a scene already resolved above him.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The mist, pendant, and books accumulate pressure toward the final image where Lyssa releases herself into dissolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she hands over the pendant and laughs into terror, crystallizing her choice to stop guarding and start dissolving. Cost is legible: she forecloses her role as keeper and her bodily coherence ("words lifting from her bones"). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (garden, Lyssa, library ruins). One meaningful deepening occurs when the figure names the books' fear of being read, which reweights Lyssa's guardianship into a prison.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with motivated escalation: Elias feeds the crozier memories and doubt, leading to the nexus explosion and his transformation. Closure lands on-page with the guild's flight and Elias's stance crystallization. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—his scars reverse, the crozier heals, but the felt price of "stopping pretending destruction was the enemy" remains more conceptual than viscerally paid. The final image reweights prior material, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration, though the cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural design with charged images (fragment, dish, tower song), but the closure—Elara jumping and reversing gravity—lacks causal setup or felt cost. The fragment's "weight reversal" is introduced only at the leap, reading as a late rule change that solves a conceptual problem it did not help create. Orientation is delayed (who/where emerges gradually but lunar perigee anchors time early enough); however, the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure because the jump's stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered imagery (starlight, timelines, hourglass filling) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ferry stabilizes, the hourglass fills with rising sand, and ghosts solidify with dual memories. Orientation anchors (Lira, ferry, grotto) arrive early. The cost is primarily conceptual—multiple timelines stitched—but the final image of rising sand and "next stop, the one after this one" reweights transience into a stable paradox. The closure effect is legible, though the felt price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (gallery, Elias, woman). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the gallery resolves, visitors recognize connection, and Elias accepts another cycle—but the cost remains abstract; "the sinew thread was already reforming" implies continuation without dramatizing what he loses or renounces. The "again?" exchange crystallizes the pattern but lacks the on-page friction or forfeiture that would make the reconfiguration undeniable. One meaningful deepening is present (the void erupts, patterns resolve), satisfying length requirements, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with Elira's growing understanding of alien navigation methods building toward the closure moment where she declares "Tomorrow, we learn to read the light" and the horizon unfolds. The orientation anchors (benthic city, Obsidian Spire, post-alien-arrival timeframe) land within the first 120 words. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Veythar shifts from endpoint to beginning—with conceptual cost legible in the phrase "some things weren't meant to hold you down." One meaningful deepening occurs when Kael begins to see the path, narrowing the city's options and opening new ones. The lens holds consistently through the accumulative pattern of description, reflection, and incremental revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words; the atrium setting and Elias's role are clear. The piece follows a Hybrid lens—Causal in the tracking mechanics, Accumulative in the mist/photograph motifs—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: Elias shifts from chasing heartbeats to being led by them, answering the dead's call with the hearing aid flickering. Cost is legible (he kneels, the aid goes dead, he accepts a new mode of work) but the child's face being "his" introduces a late backstory element that isn't causally prepared, creating mild whiplash. The closure reweights his role and the photograph, satisfying the lens, though the reveal feels more asserted than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (poetic layering with recurring motifs). Orientation anchors arrive by ~120 words (research facility, tide, cables). The closure operates as Charged Poise—Elias surfaces with the gold fleck and a glowing drop of water, crystallizing his role as retriever of the unremembered—but the cost remains abstract and asserted ("finally seen") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or tangible consequence. The phase-seam crossing and the junction-box discovery advance knowledge without narrowing tactics or forcing a visible sacrifice, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (observatory, snow, control console, time stamp). The piece uses an accumulative lens: static clears → voice speaks → ink patterns emerge → Lena syncs her heartbeat → closure image of snow and pulse. However, the closure unit lacks decisive change or visible cost: Lena shifts from fear to acceptance, but no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The death certificate and heartbeat-counting remain thematic echoes rather than constraints that alter tactics. The ending reconfigures her stance (she's no longer alone in the count), but the cost is asserted ("no longer sharp") rather than dramatized through a trade-off or forfeiture visible in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within opening lines and builds toward a clear RR/CR closure: Veyra becomes part of the echo, the diamond cracks, and the language's death is complete. However, the crucial moment—"You were never meant to understand"—arrives via exposition rather than a choice or renunciation that the reader watches unfold; the escalation is summarized ("echoes wrapped around her ankles") instead of enacted in real time. The Accumulative/Textural lens is legible and the closure image resonates, but the cost at the peak beat is asserted more than dramatized, keeping the score in the mid-6s rather than the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the phone-voice and arrowhead-seed suggest causal links, but the garden's eruption and Elias's transformation proceed via coincidence and external force rather than protagonist decision or accumulative pattern-teaching. Closure (Elias laughing as he's pulled under, then "metamorphosed into something far stranger") reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is decorative—no on-page sentence shows what specific option or identity he forecloses, only poetic assertion that he "chose the latter" without dramatizing the renunciation or its price. The orientation anchor (herbalist's underground garden, after the missing return) arrives clearly, but causality fractures when the arrowhead spontaneously becomes a seed and vines erupt without prior setup or Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (brass gears, locust shell, heart rhythms) and culminates in a pattern break (statues melting, trees shedding metal). However, the closure unit—the statues melting and the orchard exhaling—lacks a legible felt cost; the violinist's final actions (tucking the shell, playing a new song) read as outcomes rather than a decisive change or renunciation that forecloses a path. The "gap between knowing and understanding" is invoked twice but never dramatized as a choice point that narrows options. Cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than on-page and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the storm bottle unfolds as a pattern-charging object, the alley of letters accumulates weight, and the final image (Elias walking through drone shadow) reweights the opening median-crossing. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"the absences linked up like constellations" and "the broken things found each other in the dark"—with the cost implicit in perpetual repetition ("Again. And again"). Orientation anchors clearly (Elias, disputed strip, twilight, arcade). One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm reveals "They're not just lost… they're *waiting*." The lens holds, the final image reconfigures prior material, and the cost is legible as ongoing labor without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the carousel paragraph). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (fragment, song, mirrors, wind chime) toward a final cadence shift when Lior "sings" with his hands and the train exhales. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the silence reweights from retreat to offering, the halo fragment pulses, and the final door metaphor crystallizes his stance with conceptual cost (endless work, listening as building). The causal chain is light—fragment leads to song leads to woman leads to mirrors—but the accumulative pattern holds and the ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the library scene deepens through layered imagery (scarf unfolding, tessellations pulsing, threads weaving into carpet) until the final morning when the child's discovery reweights the opening stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias becomes "a fold in the story," the library transforms into a living mouth, and the scarf's dissolution charges the ending image with felt cost—he surrenders the object to gain the pattern. One meaningful deepening is present and the cost is legible on the page in the scarf's dissolution and the library's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "whispering archipelago" remains atmospheric rather than spatial. The closure attempt—pressing the photograph and choosing "Stay"—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted through poetic imagery ("a footstep, half-erased by the tide") rather than demonstrably altering her options or the dream's state. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early, but the final reconfiguration feels more decorative than decisive: she returns to the library, labels the volume, and resumes her cycle without visible friction or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (locksmith, shop, evening stars). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ribbon unravels, the map blooms, the shop dissolves and reassembles—each beat reweights the dominant stake (freeing the trapped idea). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the locksmith's realization that "the boldest act wasn't opening, but *letting the locked thing decide*" reconfigures the premise with felt cost (she tucks the now-ordinary hair beside her unopened locket, accepting perpetual irresolution). One meaningful deepening is present and cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Elias, sunken greenhouse, night of detection). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers residue traces, memory fragments, and broken-star imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias accepts "the weight of his own life" and confronts the thief. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (the fairy ring crumbles, the constellation knits, he feels life's weight "heavy and bright"), and the memory eater's emergence provides a charged final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the thief was *trading* rather than stealing, reweighting prior wreckage and gaps. Minor slip: the friend reveal lacks groundwork, reading as a late convenience rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is Charged Poise—Kael's annotations glow as a map, the shadow is bound, and Elspeth's unspoken knowledge ("the cost of coming back") crystallizes the stakes without resolving them. The cost is felt in her deliberate silence and the library's hum of possibility. One meaningful deepening (tea-leaf reading → binding the shadow) narrows options under pressure. Lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the veil crossing teaches a permeable-worlds premise early enough to hold. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias departs, leaving the sapling and apple with conceptual cost: "debt" and the echo of loneliness), yet the cost remains abstract—no line specifies what Elias forfeits beyond his presence. The accumulative lens (density increase via the orchard blooming, children recognizing colors, saplings whisperId language of light) holds through the ending, but the final beat ("wonder was not something you kept") drifts into theme-statement rather than image-driven repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias's deliberate unraveling of the final knot is a Decisive Change that releases the drowned with visible cost (the prisms shatter, the net dissolves, his role shifts from restorer to "door"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered images of frayed nets, silk patience, accumulated silence—and the final cadence shift (laughter replacing gasps, doors unlatched, spirits freed) reweights the dominant stake with undeniable cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the needle hovers, the knot swells, and Elias chooses release over repair. Orientation is clear early (prism sanctuary, Elias kneeling, net in hand, oil lamp glow) and the lens holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through overlapping film reels, shifting shadows, and the map's tear, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's palm on the pillar and the projector's shutdown crystallize her understanding that silence is a language. Cost is felt conceptually—she returns with "no proof, only quiet certainty"—and the henge's hum "still thrumming in her ribs" charges the final image. Orientation anchors (vault, henge, Elara) land early. One deduction: the "whispered chapel" as moment rather than place arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality, slightly softening the closure's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (underwater library, Liora, post-Electra discovery). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (snow globe, notebook, lighthouse keeper dream, storm breaking) that reweight Liora's stance on pursuing answers. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she chooses to lie in her report and stop chasing thresholds, forfeiting her investigative mission with quiet but legible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the snow's direction shifts and she understands "the cost of light," narrowing her options toward release. Closure lands cleanly under the accumulative lens with felt cost, though the final beats rely heavily on metaphor to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The courtyard anchors who/where by line three; the encoding ritual accumulates density through chalk marks, graffiti shifts, and the bolt plate warming. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost unravels, lanterns flare, the balladeer walks away with the work "never really done")—the cost is conceptual (the silence he carries, the child now marked) rather than a decisive personal change, but the final image reweights the premise of translation-as-burden. One friction: the mist "inverted" and clouds "churning upward" feel more like atmospheric gesture than a stakes-altering event, slightly softening the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (elevator ascent, diary numbers, frozen gardens, scattered light) toward a final cadence shift when clouds part and ice burns. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "cold was just the price of seeing clearly" reweights the spire from prison to lens with felt cost (every frozen step). Orientation is clean by ~120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Liora realizes the servant chased light-moments rather than recording isolation, which reframes her own stance and enables the final climb.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: atmospheric density builds through layered images (clouds as memory, the broken string reforming as light) toward a final reconfiguration where Elias accepts unity with the sky. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he stops resisting the fall), but the cost is abstract—no tactical choice or visible forfeiture occurs on the page. The gondola's miraculous restoration ("string restored—not as rope, but as light") undercuts any price paid. Orientation is clean early (sky gondola, telescope, adrift), so no Orientation Test penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: the artist moves from knife to brush, painting "nothing," forecloses the compulsion with felt cost, and the final line crystallizes earned stasis ("let the limits hold her"). Orientation anchors early (oak hollow, night deadline, artist at work). The causal chain holds—coin unlocks safe, instruction drives glass installation, collapse teaches the lesson—but the dream sequence and wake blur into extended coda, diluting the decisive moment's charge. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal turn; the choice to paint nothing reconfigures prior material, yet the multi-paragraph drift after the coin-drop softens closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered clues (phrasebook, hopscotch board, light pattern) that converge at the moment Liora traces the sequence and the ship breaks free. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the loop snaps, engines roar, horizon opens) with visible cost in the form of weeks adrift and the crew's grumbling doubt now resolved. Orientation anchors (airship, starlings, captain's study) arrive promptly. One friction: the phrasebook's map overlay feels convenient—it arrives exactly when needed without prior setup that it contained navigational data.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the locksmith retrieves the watch, opens the door her sister vanished through, and reframes herself from mender to key—a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses her old identity. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through gears, mirrors, prophecy scraps, and the final image reweights the premise with the watch "warm against her ribs." Orientation anchors (frozen library, dawn, Hall of Whispers) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water-mirror hums and the child appears, narrowing her options to a single irreversible reach. The three-winters backstory and the eclipse door feel slightly scaffolded rather than discovered in scene, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the nebula of respite accretes through repeated gestures (bell-ringing, chalked messages, butterfly garden) rather than causal reversals. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"We stay" crystallizes the communal stance—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no single on-page forfeiture or tactical shift anchors the final image. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, yet the ending reweights meaning through assertion ("the universe breathed back") rather than a concrete, irreversible act or visible loss that makes the before/after undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (lyric density, nested images) and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clock shifts from countdown to hush-keeper, reweighting its function. Cost is conceptual—Elias's role ends, the puppet vanishes—but the final image's pressure is muted by the lack of on-page renunciation or dramatized forfeiture. Orientation is delayed: who Elias is and what "adjusting the doomsday clock" means concretely remains vague past the first third, though the lighthouse anchor arrives early. The lyric mode holds, but causality within that mode is thin—events unfold as poetic sequence rather than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the blueprint functions as a recurring anchor, the nut-placements accrue meaning across beats, and the final placement of the last nut reweights Liora's stance with visible cost (she keeps this one for herself, then uses it anyway, foreclosing her personal safety net). Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise—the labyrinth won't open yet, but Liora's commitment crystallizes with the mechanical birds locked by frost and the traveler walking free below. Cost is legible: she has spent her last prepared escape route and commits to an indefinite future of custodianship. Minor deduction: the blueprint's mechanical function is told more than dramatized; we never see Liora attempt the gears, so the escalation remains in her mind rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers water/pattern/polymer imagery toward a final cadence shift where "letting go" replaces "building bridges." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias releases the chrysalis and wades deeper, forecloses atonement-through-building with visible cost (the decade of misdirected effort). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The final convergence image reweights all prior "divergent path" material without stating a moral, and the girl's arrival provides a grace note rather than resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Textural/Accumulative lens with its lyric, image-driven mode and recurring motifs (slates, moonlight, pauses). However, no single beat narrows options or changes Liora's stance; the patron's arrival and departure function as illustration rather than escalation. The ending reiterates the opening premise ("stories begin where silence breaks") without reweighting it through visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. Orientation is swift (library, Liora, opening day by paragraph two), but the closure unit reads as a thematic echo rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accretes sensory detail and metaphoric weight around the pavilion and memory-tasting until the final "clean" moment. Orientation is delayed: we don't learn Elias is a chef until paragraph three, and the pavilion's location/nature emerges slowly, though the atmospheric buildup partially justifies this. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (taste now clean, burden lifted), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—what exactly has Elias given up or risked by performing this ritual? The ending gestures toward cyclical renewal ("The pavilion would call again") without showing what stakes have narrowed or what path has been foreclosed. Causality is loose: the vial-pouring succeeds without friction, and we're told the weight lifts rather than shown a choice that makes it so.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the weight's absence fragments communication, its return seeds reconciliation, and the final choral image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the silos gain "bridges" through interspersed languages, and the final choir performance charges the image with communal cost (years of silence breaking). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias accepts the engraved weight and agrees to try. Cost is felt but somewhat diffuse—no single foreclosed path is made vivid on the page, lowering the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered reflections, ending on "cartographer of the entangled dark." Orientation anchors Lena, canyon, moonlight by the second paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts the entanglements), but cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The piece teaches its pattern (mirror adjustments → layered visions), but the final walk doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it reads as thematic statement. One meaningful deepening (visions surface) is present, but the Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what she loses or pays.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal arc: manuscript → grotto → chamber → seed retrieval → planting intention. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Lysara shifts from seeker to key, and the seed between her ribs crystallizes her new stance. Cost is legible (the manuscript goes blank, the chamber seals, her brother remains lost), though the final image's emotional price could be sharper. The inferred lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid, held cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory details and the deepening communion between Elias, the sculpture, and the grove, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the insulator left behind, the melody carried by siskins). Cost is present but oblique—Elias walks away—so the closure reads as Earned Stasis with a quiet handoff rather than a decisive forfeiture with sharp sting.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Charged Poise closure where Elias's gift of the stone crystallizes a new stance and reconfigures the covenant from broken to listening. The cost—releasing his thirteen-year talisman and the weight in his chest—is legible on the page in the final third. One deduction: the nexus's magnetic tremors correlating to "ancient games" sets up a causal mechanic that is never paid off or tested under pressure, creating a dangling setup that slightly weakens mid-escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the diary's patterns layer onto Elias's device work, building toward the realization that "empathy isn't enough," then the morning coda charges the closure with the "Silence repaired here" sign and collaborative repair. Cost is legible—he leaves his solitary workshop and commits to public engagement—but the final beat's conceptual repricing could land harder if the woman's silent arrival dramatized a tangible trade-off or foreclosed option. The two-part structure (night/morning) works within the accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Liora, treetop village, stolen seed, immediately establishing stakes. The causal chain—theft, planting, bloom, Elders' arrival, Liora's realization, village acceptance—holds under a hybrid lens tilting accumulative/textural at closure. The flower functions as both plot driver and conceptual mirror, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora recognizes serenity in the sway itself and the village unlocks the vault. Cost is visible (theft, confrontation, redefinition of serenity) and the ending image—new bridge, unlocked vault, tea—reweights the premise with trust as the undercurrent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flower's perfume forces truths to surface, narrowing Liora's path from defiance to integration.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered discovery beats (moss, arch-mouth, seed, sapling) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights "resilience" from sought mystery to embodied instruction. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The closure lands with Veyra's bodily transformation and resolve to plant the sapling at the core, reconfiguring her role from seeker to answer-carrier. However, cost remains largely asserted rather than felt on the page: the mentor's arrow crumbles (symbolic but not visceral), and Veyra's acceptance of the moss lacks visible friction or trade-off, weakening the final beat's charge under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (port city, convergence, Veyra's role) land early. The piece follows a causal lens: wind anomaly → investigation → convergence encounter → flare discovery → tactical shift, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Veyra logs a new variable with the city "learning" reweighting her investigative stance. The cost is conceptual and professional (torn patch, shattered instrument, acceptance of an adaptive adversary), legible in the final image. One tightening suffices at this length, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early (Liora, ice cavern) but "when" is unclear: the timeframe element—"at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble"—is introduced as backstory lore, not a present ticking clock, creating mild disorientation. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the aurora stays, the world remembers wonder, but the cost is abstract—"the elders would call this heresy"—without on-page consequence or forfeiture that alters Liora's options. The accumulative lens (colors, light, sound-as-architecture) holds through the ending, but the lack of a legible, felt price keeps closure from landing decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Elias stops fighting, crosses the threshold, leaves the flute uncased—visible cost is the surrender of his role and identity. The piece signals early who/where ("Elias knelt in the blue-gray dusk…Thunder-Echo Range"), holds a single POV, and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens (density increase, pattern break via "the hush," cadence shift at crossing). One escalation point—playing the flute "not to seal the breach, but to widen it"—narrows options meaningfully. Causality is adequate but elliptical: the driftwood rearranges itself by "unseen hand" and the child materializes without full on-page mechanics, relying on atmosphere over because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who and where early, satisfying the orientation test. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: halo fragment usage, star-vanishing pattern, and shifting ink accumulate toward a conceptual repricing in the final image. However, the closure unit—"You were never the printer. You were the page."—reconfigures the premise through direct statement rather than image or action, and the cost remains oblique. The because/therefore linkage is weak; the halo fragment "dissolves" and the stars "speak back" without clear causal grounding in prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece attempts a lyric accumulative design but fails the orientation test: by line 120 (~"He'd spent a decade delivering relics..."), who/where/when remain vague, and the disorientation never pays off structurally at closure. The causal chain breaks when the woman appears without setup, instantly demonstrates seed germination the courier never could, and offers expository revelations about the mentor that lack prior grounding. The ending delivers multiple micro-closures (bridge forms, woman dissolves, courier plants seed, walks into fade) rather than one decisive reweighting, and the cost is conceptual ("his hands didn't tremble") without a legible price paid on the page. The drive lens wobbles between causal (pendant vibrates → finds woman) and accumulative (aurora imagery accretes) without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with clear because/therefore linkage: Elias communes → perceives absorbed emotion → prism warms and answers → frost reshapes into his mother's face → he realizes the prism contains her legacy → he shatters it. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost (empty pockets, hands still) that forecloses the inheritance path. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when the prism begins answering, escalating from passive absorption to active haunting, narrows his options and forces the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (spinner, orchard, bamboo forest) arrive early; the piece teaches a mosaic pattern across decades and POVs by the midpoint. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—his weaving mirrors hers, reweighting the premise of distance and sacrifice—with felt cost (another lifetime, orchard waiting). One tightening: the bead's discovery and integration into the tapestry narrows her options and sends the message. The lens holds, but the lover's segment introduces new spatial/temporal coordinates (city of glass) without a clear transition cue, creating brief disorientation before the mirroring becomes legible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on-page: the planet awakens, the smith earns the right to try again, and villagers descend into shafts that no longer tremble. The cost is legible—the silk is spent, magic exhausted—but the causal link between feeding silk into a fissure and planetary healing relies on assertion rather than earned mechanics. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of defiance, azure threads, orchard imagery building to cadence shift), held consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ground sighs and arches realign, reweighting the stake from repair to awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric recurrence (shard, seam, map metaphor). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; when is dreamlike but cued early. The closure moment—stepping through with the man, becoming "the map"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: "the weight in her chest wasn't fear" describes a feeling without forfeiting a live option or revealing what she left behind. The seam's redirection and shard transformation mid-scene create a micro turn, but the final step forward carries no legible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the layering of letters, stones, and sea glass until the spiral becomes a tangible language and Elias's reply marks Charged Poise—he commits to staying and building upward, crystallizing the relationship with cost (the rotting skiff). Orientation anchors promptly (lighthouse, skiff, three months post-lamp death). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final decision to let the skiff rot and write "Tomorrow, we build a door" reconfigures his isolation into chosen communion, with the conceptual cost of severing his exit. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fourth letter includes the stone spiral map, changing his stance from passive ritual to active response.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes atmospheric density and pattern (lighthouse ritual, storm coiling, shadows pressing) toward a final image of renewal and return. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse, Liora, night ritual). However, closure lacks legible cost—Liora descends with "hands still warm," smiling, already counting hours until she climbs again; the storm defers, the village stirs with hope, but no visible price is paid and no option foreclosed. The ending reads as tonal recurrence rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (dye master, floating tea house, post-transplant). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the wing's dissolution and the painted stories in the village accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in which the protagonist's heart "settled into its new rhythm, no longer borrowed, but his own." Cost is felt (the wing dissolves, the journey exhausts him) and the final image of silence as invitation reweights the opening restlessness. One meaningful deepening occurs when he paints in the village and the villagers reach for each other, shifting his understanding from magnetism to recognition of need.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertones. Orientation anchors who (Elias, keeper), where (tower/labyrinth), and what (storm, sextant found) within the opening lines. The piece accumulates through discovery→disassembly→realization→resolution, culminating in the trees-as-absorbers insight that reweights the opening image of "shifting walls" and "scattered dreams." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias returns to his maintenance work with understanding deepened, the sextant's pieces released to the trees, and the astronomer unburdened off-page. Cost is conceptual and relational—he has passed sorrow along, accepted his role as intermediary—legible in "His hands...already felt lighter" and the labyrinth's approving hum. No causality breaks; the pattern of absorb-process-release holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered memory fragments, singing intensifies, and the greenhouse shifts from dead to blooming. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of villagers joining voices and mica windows shattering reweights the opening stasis with undeniable transformation. Cost is visible: Liora's throat burns, she bleeds, and she moves from keeper to song itself. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirror world "began to sing back," escalating from solo effort to reciprocal restoration. The causal chain holds except for the villagers' arrival, which lacks prior setup and reads as coincidental resolution rather than earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (library as nested paradoxes, the mirrors, the repeating sentence). Orientation is delayed: we learn "the library" and "Lena" quickly, but spatial anchors (the hidden chamber, the mirrors) emerge late. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (locking the door after twelve years, walking out "not to hide")—the cost is felt but oblique, hinging on the annotation and Voss's spectral guidance rather than Lena's on-page renunciation of a live choice. The thesis reappears annotated, but we don't see Lena wrestle with it in real time; the release is asserted. Causal linkage is soft: Voss's appearance and the *Book of Corrections* function as symbolic permission rather than pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a pattern of noticed strangeness and withheld action, then deepens through Liora's guerrilla baking that reverses the city's adjustment reflex. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bakery's sign reappears; coins "feel like enough"), with conceptual cost legible in the city's years of normalizing horror. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. One minor causality slip: the oven "roared to life" without prior setup of Liora's ability or the tea house's latent magic, though the pattern of impossible warmth partially covers it.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: luminous vows accumulate until the door marked "Remember" opens and the bridge appears, reweighting Elias's extraction task into an invitation. Closure lands on the page (he steps onto the bridge, the library dissolves, he reaches for her hand) with the conceptual cost that his life's work is released as "stardust" and his purpose fulfilled. The causality of why this particular slide and this woman trigger the bridge is thin—dream-scribbles in his ledger are mentioned but never dramatized—so the invitation feels convenient. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (frozen library, orderly records chief, measuring luminous vows by ~line 3).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: Papa's deal → his death → Lena's trap → Veyne's exposure follows motivated linkage. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis (she walks away carrying the sound, foreclosing revenge's continuation) with visible cost—she must live with that knowledge. Orientation anchors early (pier, market, Veyne's stall). One tightening suffices: the escalation from offer to laugh to market judgment. Minor issue: "By sunrise, the harbor would take what it was owed" tells rather than shows the cost mechanism, slightly softening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear pattern escalation (compass ring → dissolution → aurora reconfiguration), and the closure image reconfigures the opening stake with conceptual weight. However, cost remains implied rather than legible on the page: what does Lira lose or forfeit by becoming the storm? The forests' "election" and her selection feel coincidental rather than causally motivated by her prior choices. Orientation anchors (lavender bluffs, aurora, Lira alone) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph, satisfying the test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory density and metaphoric layering until the lock-painting interaction triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the door/tapestry image reweights suppressed creativity with visible cost: leaving the lantern, accepting the feral brightness). Orientation anchors cleanly (cave, Elias, post-funeral). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lock's dial is turned "to a memory" and the painting splits—this reweights the dominant stake (uncorking creativity) and forecloses the old, sketched life. Cost is legible: he leaves the lantern and climbs with color-smudged fingers, proof of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: fragment → map assembly → Archive descent → writing truth → refusal to gild. Orientation anchors (Veridion, greenhouse domes, Elias's studio) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Elias choosing not to gild and refusing the new fragment—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (the hollow desk, empty inkwell, decision to "begin again" without his former craft). One small slip: the zinc plate's "etchings worn away" reads slightly convenient, as if the map consumed itself to manufacture symbolic closure rather than earning it through Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens by the first third and maintains it through the iceberg-shattering climax. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraphs. The closure—ice dissolving into the wind, Liora standing at the bluff edge—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: the world below remains unchanged, but her stance crystallizes around continued preservation work. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ice shatters and scatters "like seeds," reweighting her labor from solitary act to potential dispersal. However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized—no visible trade-off or forfeited option surfaces on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis transitioning to Decisive Change: Elias walks into the desert, foreclosing his caretaker role with visible cost (leaving the dome, the next caretaker arriving). Causal lens holds throughout—box discovery triggers memory, memory contextualizes the controlled burn, burn enables departure. Orientation anchors (dome, roses, Elias) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the magnetic shift's peak pressure forces the fire decision, which then reweights all prior "containment" into a trap he must escape.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the locket's discovery → mailbox opening → letter reveal → community response builds density and cadence shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the mailbox becomes a conduit for collective storytelling), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page sentence makes Mira's or the community's sacrifice legible. The "tick-tick" and filled mailbox offer atmospheric repricing without a sharp felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (water, dice, dance, encryption metaphors) toward a final reconfiguration where Lira transforms the scientist's encrypted fear into embodied code. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Conceptual Repricing): she lets the lab drown, carrying the pattern forward in her body with visible cost—the journals dissolve, the scientist's name is forgotten. Orientation anchors early (sunken lab, Lira alone, journal decoding). One meaningful deepening occurs when the dice trigger the failsafe and she must dance to unlock it, narrowing her path to embodied performance. Cost is felt but slightly diffuse: "the knowledge that even drowning could be an act of creation" gestures at transformation without a sharp on-page forfeiture that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual repetition, sensory density in the chamber, and the gravitational pull metaphor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when he discards the tools and accepts that memories are "taken," not lost. The cost is legible on the page—he loses his method and must begin again, knowing the futility. One meaningful deepening occurs in the chamber when the stone disintegrates and he sees her silhouette, reweighting his understanding of what he's chasing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who she is, where exactly she stands, and what the prophecy concretely threatens remain vague past the first third; apply −0.4 under the Orientation Test. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered images, cadence), but the closure unit lacks legible cost: the prophecy shifts from "scream" to "sigh" off-page, and she sleeps without a decision or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The final image (crane at dawn) is a cameo, not a reweighting anchored in prior causality. Because/therefore linkage is absent; events flow as lyric tableaux without a tightening that narrows her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias inherits Veyra's tutor role, the cycle explicitly repeats with the new scholar and desk mention, and the cost—becoming "patient as the dead, nimble as a lie"—is legible on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: meteor showers frame lessons, the seal's warmth shifts to cold, and the rooftop tea ritual recurs with reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors (Elias, third-floor door, borrowed sugar premise) arrive within the first ~100 words. One escalation beat (signing the contract that opens the building's grief) tightens the dominant stake sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence. The closure—Liora's archival act that creates resonance beyond her capture—lands on the page with conceptual cost (her body taken, her archive spreading). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the garden's resonance structures, the shell's pulse, and the final image of blooming petals build density toward a final reweighting. One meaningful pressure point (the lattice activation) deepens stakes, though the authorities' arrival feels convenient rather than causally seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece follows a Causal lens: the forger's use of the thorn dissolves the decrees, which triggers the Emperor's collapse and plea, leading to collaborative rewriting and systemic change. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Emperor kneels and asks to be taught, foreclosing the vengeance path with visible cost (his crown tilts, tears fall). The closure—burning seals, teaching a child the new script—lands on the page with felt cost and a legible before/after. Minor scaffold ("The unfinished was forgiven") and some thematic Echo in the final third prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Veyra's descent progressively discloses information (traitor's name, location, then the nexus's true function) that narrows her understanding and leads to the climactic song. Closure lands on-page—she severs the threads, silences the shell, and walks away—with the cost of renouncing further answers legible in the final image. However, the universe's "secret song" and the nexus's mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the webs are literal threads in Kaelis's scene but metaphorical elsewhere, creating minor coherence drift. One meaningful tightening occurs when she learns echoes are answers, not memories, which reweights her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Lena in her ice shrine after the *SS Marrow* wreck. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) closure—Lena's pattern of salvaging fragments continues with visible cost (the mother's reproach, the waiting dead). The widow's departure and Lena's return to candlelight enact a meaningful deepening: the ritual's cost becomes undeniable. One causal gap: the mechanics of how Lena "sees" the cameo appearances remain asserted rather than demonstrated in a choice moment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory detail, recurring motifs (whisk, whistle, net, moon path), and a final cadence shift when Liora assumes the mending role. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—the cycle persists, Kael's work is "complete, but never truly finished," and Liora steps into the frame with visible acceptance of hidden labor. Cost is conceptual and relational (assuming the burden) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Causal lens but the core turn—Elias pressing his palm to the diamond and letting the stillpoint "show him how to turn the key"—arrives without prior causality establishing what the key is or how he knows to operate it. The closure unit (his reaching out, the light taking him, the orchard's disappearance) reads as a Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted ("the orchard was gone. So was Elias Voss") rather than felt on the page in his final moment. The "cure" reframe lacks sufficient groundwork in prior beats to make the repricing undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change—Elias seals the portico, hurls the receiver, and becomes the prophet—with a visible shift in agency. The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: he listens to transmissions → they grow insistent → he must choose → he seals then breaks the portal → the city rises and he transforms. However, the cost feels more asserted than demonstrated; we're told he's no longer just "the needle" but shown primarily through metaphor rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and the single-scene structure with storm-as-countdown provides coherent pressure, but the final transformation depends heavily on late-introduced mechanics (the portico drinks the receiver, the reflection speaks) that weren't meaningfully constrained earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Elias moves from hoarding echoes to sharing them, a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise transitioning to enacted change). Cost is visible in his letting go and the music box's "stubborn, beautiful defiance" producing only one note. Orientation anchors are present early (vagrant poet, loft, dunes, dawn). The girl's knock provides a meaningful turn that reweights his collecting obsession into generative sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph (engineer, drift-ice marina, dusk). The drive lens is Causal: she descends, slots the key, turns it → sphere sings → ice fractures → resonator redirects energy → artifact stabilizes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she endures cellular unraveling to redirect the sphere's energy, foreclosing her human form with on-page cost ("her nerves rewriting themselves"). One micro turn when the ice "sang back" shifts from cage to conduit. The cost is legible in ragged gasps and the body's transformation, though the final smile and "rest" soften the price slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors are present early (lake, basalt sanctuary, Lior), and the closure lands with a clear image: Lior stepping onto the rising viaduct. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—patience, moon paths, and wildness accrue through imagery and cadence shift toward the final act. However, the viaduct's literal rise feels symbolic rather than causally grounded; no prior beat shows why *this* dawn triggers the ascent, weakening the "because" linkage even under an accumulative lens. Cost is oblique: Lior turns his back on the sanctuary, but what he forfeits (community? warmth? argument?) remains abstract rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid: discovered symbols and sealed wall force Elias's decision to expose the city's erasure. Orientation anchors cleanly (maintenance tunnel, post-drought, investigator role). The wall's trembling and water seepage provide a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elias commits to digging up the past—but the cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page; the final image ("He climbed") asserts resolve without showing what he forfeits or risks in that exact moment.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens early: the clockwork heart gathers symbolic weight through winding, installation, melody, and finally the storm-walk to the post office. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias moves from waiting for absolution to making it—with visible cost (the soaked walk, the letters begun). Orientation is swift (chaplain, shop, morning delivery). The escalation is a single meaningful deepening when the music triggers his decision to write, sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Pip, a cart glider), where (workshop above acid sea), and what (testing flight modifications) by the first two paragraphs; the ~120-word test passes. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated test-crash cycles, the kaleidoscope image reweights her approach, and the arrow tip's integration marks a shift. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"She was *conducting*" crystallizes a new relationship to flight, the workshop's collapse becomes "the first draft," and the final leap with the arrow melted into her chestplate reconfigures prior material. Cost is felt (the workshop destroyed, her body partly rebuilt with "two borrowed" fingers) and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening (from falling to conducting) is sufficient at this length, though the conceptual cost could be more undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens: Lena's query triggers the file, which leads to coordinates, then the crystal pull that restores memories and flags her for termination. The recurring numbers function as breadcrumbs that tighten options. Closure arrives on-page with a decisive change—Lena chooses deletion to join the archived—and the cost is death/erasure. One weakness: the mechanism by which the patch "vibrates with stored sound" and Elias speaks through it is introduced late without prior setup, creating a small causality gap at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "peacekeeper of the Hollow Coast" and "lighthouse" early, but the specific present stakes—what Elias must choose now, what he risks—remain vague until late. The closure unit is a Charged Poise: Elias steps forward as the mirrors shatter, reconfiguring his role from observer to participant. However, the cost is more asserted ("the space between seeing and doing") than demonstrated; no specific option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, relying on atmosphere and image density, but the escalation reads as a gradual intensification rather than a decisive tightening that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: silence → ice-crossing → laugh → initials discovery → cancellation forms a pattern of reweighting. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (stance shift toward "slow unraveling"), and the final image ("space between breaths") charges prior material. The initials twist feels planted rather than causally inevitable—it arrives to solve rather than complicate, weakening the earned quality of her reversal. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph; one meaningful deepening (ice-crossing forces the laugh) tightens her relationship to endings.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lior's decision to fold the letter and return to the vineyard reweights his solitary role with visible acceptance—"the weight of it felt lighter." The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with one meaningful cadence shift at the ending that deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clean (who, where, when by early paragraphs). Cost is felt but oblique; the exact sentence "he stepped back into the vineyard" carries acceptance of ongoing isolation, yet the price could be more viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early—whispers, fraying clearings, peripheral awareness—and accumulates through sensory intensification and the parapet's responsive song. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lysan restores the clearing's borders, the weight eases, she steps back "strangely honest, strangely whole" with cost legible in her exhaustion and the knowledge she can only hold "long enough." Orientation is swift (Lysan, clearing edge, dunes, pavilion). One meaningful deepening when the parapet "shivered...then sang" and the clearing sharpened, narrowing from entropy to temporary stasis with visible effort-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (photographs, lavender, butterfly, ruins) and the final shot attempts to consolidate meaning. Orientation anchors (archivist, lavender field, factory ruins) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the photograph will be hung, the town will feel the past reaching forward), but cost remains implied rather than legible on the page—no visible price paid, no option foreclosed. The piece teaches its pattern but the ending assertion ("the world walked with her") tells rather than shows the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the crystal's distortions, the woman's arrival, and the final realization that "the pattern wasn't in the growing. It was in the listening." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization)—Elias moves from solitary obsession to collaborative testimony—with felt cost (leaving the library, relinquishing sole ownership of the discovery). The cost is legible in the final image: "leaving the library to its suspended quiet." One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and sustains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, chalk spirals, driftwood arrows, and the tape build density until the sculpture animates and Elias lets the arrows wash away. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he stops locating, releases the markers—but the cost is asserted ("he didn't mind") rather than made visceral on the page. The escalation is a single tightening (sculpture moves, Elias presses the tape) rather than a deepening that narrows options through his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (poetic register, layered imagery, rhythm over causal linkage) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (lunar observatory, Elias, spinning clock hand), and the final image reweights prior material (stillness → motion, repair → release) with conceptual cost legible in "he didn't look back." One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias matches the hand's rhythm, shifting his stance from fixing to flowing. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant), though the conceptual cost remains oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through cadence shift—Mrs. Calloway's white-knuckled grip loosens, her tap keeps time, her clarity returns—culminating in Lena's release of the vinyl shard as Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation with felt cost). Orientation anchors (hospice, dusk, seven years' tenure) land early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mrs. Calloway's memory surfaces and reweights the hymn from denial to honored goodbye. Cost is legible in the dropped shard and the knowledge that "another goodbye would have to be flawless."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens: Elara finds the key → activates the automaton → learns shadows are waiting → opens the second door → crosses into the library. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she steps through, the door seals, and she begins to "relearn the shape of hunger," forecloses her return with visible finality ("The door sealed shut behind her"). The Spooning event and "Unspoken Cycle" backstory arrive early but remain abstract; the mechanics of "closing loops" are declared more than dramatized, slightly muddying causality in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure occurs on-page: the changeling sheds its skin, the brother returns unmarked, and Liora pockets the needle knowing "some doors shouldn't stay closed." The cost, however, is asserted rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or changed relationship anchors the transformation. Lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid: the tooth-to-well-to-changeling sequence links causally, but the climax relies on declarative magic ("Turn them into stars") without tactical constraint. Orientation is clean by ~80 words (Liora, hedge maze, garden).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (mist, sea glass, memories) and the girl's arrival provides a cadence shift that reweights the keeper role. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge transfer, Charged Poise as the girl grasps the weight), though the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The child's coincidental arrival at the exact teaching moment weakens causal linkage; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early but the final transfer lacks a visible price that alters Liora's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (abandoned data center, three days post-viral confession). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (moss, icicle patterns, pendant) and a cadence shift at the proffering moment. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lena unclasps the pendant, Javier accepts it, and the final image ("for the first time since the confession, the wounds didn't feel like endings") reconfigures the dominant stake with felt cost (she relinquishes her grandmother's anchor). One small causality gap: why Javier would follow her to this specific location is asserted rather than earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the nexus, mist, cameo figures, and manuscript pages layer meaning until the final image reweights the premise—"Hope is not a shape you carve—it's the current you learn to ride." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Elias's dissolution and the shimmering manuscript constitute a clear before/after with conceptual cost (bodily disappearance, artistic transformation). One meaningful deepening occurs when the faceless figure confronts him and the cameos dissolve into ink, narrowing his options from control to surrender. The orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored early), and the pattern of ephemeral appearances is taught by the second paragraph, paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph and follows an accumulative lens: the vines' decay → song attempt → revival → closure commitment. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis morphing into Charged Poise): Mira commits to teaching the songs, foreclosing her safer tinkerer-only path, and the final image ("stepped into the light") reweights prior material with visible cost (her voice "cracked and uncertain," throat burned). Cost is legible in the song's physical toll and the social commitment she now accepts. One persistent constraint—loss of the songs—shapes tactics throughout and reappears at closure ("Next year, we'll sing louder").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is Accumulative/Textural: layered patterns, density increase, and a cadence shift at the ending ("She had been teaching it how to stay"). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the time-window remains impressionistic but legible. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the alchemist's endless work with the cost felt in "her patience as endless as the dark" and the recursive loop of kneeling again. One meaningful deepening is present, though the middle section loops description without tightening options or knowledge in a dramatized way.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (locksmith), where (marble cavern), and when (wounded season's end) within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered backstory (daughter's question three years ago, wife's lullaby seven years ago, harvest practices long abandoned) and the final image—timer ticking like a heartbeat—reweights the premise with quiet cost (the mechanism left vulnerable, the season turning). One meaningful deepening occurs when the timer produces the wife's voice, crystallizing the locksmith's success and the fragility of his project. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the locksmith leaves the timer running, foreclosing secrecy and accepting exposure, with cost legible in "just in case the world ever asked for proof." No causality breaks, though the ease of success (final gear "slotted into place with a sigh") undercuts tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift: who, where, and action by the opening lines. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (fisherman's grief, blacksmith's rage, child's fear) and the grotto's reciprocal weight, culminating in Elira's conceptual repricing as loom rather than weaver. Closure lands with felt cost: she vanishes, forecloses her prior life, and becomes part of the hush. The epilogue move ("By the next snowmelt...") extends the window but the final image of her absorbed by the grotto charges the premise. One deduction: the turn from "collect" to "be collected" hinges on the grotto's sudden counter-offer, which feels underprepared—no prior cue that the grotto could reverse the transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: widow, loft, morning routine by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the ritual of carving, each iteration reweighting her relationship to loss until the final lion stays on the windowsill, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost: she stops selling, accepts the lesson of impermanence). The cost is legible in the shift from market sale to solitary keeping, and the closing lines reconfigure the opening stakes ("learning how to let them go"). One meaningful deepening through the girl's question and the widow's response, then the decision to place the final carving in light rather than currency.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors by line 6 (carousel, lagoon, Lira's age uncertainty, camera wheel). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered pasts (merchant's boast, child's sob, woman's shadow) converging with ghost encounters, then deepens when multiple Liras emerge from the lagoon. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira's surrender—"let the past have her, just for now"—forecloses escape with felt cost, and the final image reweights the opening's frozen carousel through her willingness to wait "until the carousel started again." Cost is legible in the hands pulling her under and her cessation of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equation *Hope = Flow × Resistance* reweights the terminal's failed promise into a pedestrian bridge, and the weather vane's shift from stars to horizon charges the final image with conceptual cost (abandoning escape for passage). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (carnival, graffiti arrows, algae-thick water) and the sextant's alignment with traveler paths. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sextant slots home and redirects flows, narrowing Lena's options from restoration to repurposing. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric reflection anchored to present stimuli (the rain-soaked forecourt, the petrichor)—and escalates through a cadence shift when the scribe kneels, fractures the crystal, and assembles the orrery. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final chime and the scribe's smile reweight years of silence with undeniable cost ("the evidence of a man who had finally stopped obeying the rules of time"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The tightening—from observation to fracture to assembly—narrows options and the ending image charges prior material. Cost is legible: the broken forecourt, the defiance of the elders, the release of the dream.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (barge, canal, Liora) within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring images (sundial, reflection, ledger) and a cadence shift when Liora drops the ledger and turns the barge back. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she walks away from the auctioneers with the sundial, foreclosing the pursuit with visible cost ("no longer lost"). The cost is legible in the drowned ledger and the acceptance that "some things weren't meant to be found." One meaningful deepening through the marshes scene reweights her understanding from seeking destinations to recognizing "the spaces between them."

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates密度 through layered images (rope, fulgurite, seed pod, bell buoy) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elias completes the splice and the harbor "answers" with the impossible bell. Orientation anchors (Elias, dock, harbor fog) arrive cleanly by the opening lines. The cost at closure is conceptual—he becomes custodian of the weavers' archive—but the felt weight of that commitment remains somewhat abstract; the final action (stepping into fog with the rope) reads more as continuation than a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (Elias, garden, post-departure city). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure accumulates through layered images (thread, garden, locket) toward a final assertion that "healing was not a place, but a direction." However, the closure unit is primarily told rather than shown—Elias's epiphany and the promise to tell the princess lack a decisive on-page moment with visible cost. The locket discovery functions as a beat but does not narrow options or alter Elias's trajectory; he was already writing the brother's story. Cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a final image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who (Prince Aldric), where (suspended palace, lowest vault), and when (seventy years post-extinction, decade of assembly) within the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (rust, salt, stained glass wings) and a cadence shift at the creature's hatching that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the prince and his "broken miracle" suspended "not in defeat, but in the quaking reverie of a world learning to breathe again," reconfiguring beauty-as-effortless into beauty-as-struggle with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the egg unfolds and the creature's flawed song rewrites expectation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with symbolic recurrence (black sand, coin, red thread, fire/healing duality). Orientation is clean. The boy's injury provides a micro-reversal, but it functions more as demonstration than escalation—Liora's stance does not meaningfully shift. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final alarm, but the cost remains abstract: "she had long since learned to tell them apart" tells us the work is already done off-page. The ending gesture (running toward smoke with coin pulsing) is atmospheric but does not reconfigure options or exact visible price in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise—fountains weep light, the city breathes, Liora departs). Orientation anchors who/where by ~80 words (Liora, city of forgotten fountains, rust pump). The box-to-door alignment and thread-pulling sequence tighten pressure through one meaningful reversal (hesitation, younger voice, then pull). Cost is present but oblique: memories torn free, voices unmuzzled, Liora leaving imply consequence yet the exact forfeiture to Liora herself (what she loses by liberating them) remains atmospheric rather than concretely legible in the final lines. The lens holds, closure lands on the page, but conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Veyra, nebula garden, gear). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (petals, sonar, light-without-fire) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the transit threshold where the pattern breaks and cost is felt (memory forfeited, garden left behind). The final image—"stepped into the light"—reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure. Cost is on the page (memory given, path foreclosed) and the lens holds. One deduction: the sonar-path revelation arrives abruptly without prior setup of the method's capability to "find places where light pooled without heat."

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered imagery (butterflies, ribbon, hollows) toward a final reconfiguration where collective grief becomes "a door" rather than "a wound." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the butterfly placed on the table crystallizes options and reweights the opening question with visible ritual cost. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The tightening occurs through the shift from carving names to carving hollows, then to teaching the daughter, with the cost legible in the carver's smile and the thunder's confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered backstory (father's broken rake, drowned child, sister's betrayal) that reweights the present act of adjusting the clock's cadence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias commits to carving the next name, crystallizing his stance as perpetual witness with visible social cost (council outrage). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat. The piece holds a single POV across one continuous scene in the tower; the reflective density (~35% backstory) exceeds default ceilings but anchors to present stimuli (the pendulum's pause, the tower's groan) and tilts present choice (pressing the rake, smiling, reaching for the knife). Cost is felt: the village will notice, the council will demand correction, and Elias accepts exile as the price of accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each knot untangled deepens atmosphere and reweights the widow's secret, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when Elias sees the river vision and understands the sovereigns were "payment for silence." The closure reconfigures the premise ("Intentions were just knots waiting to be named") with felt cost—he now holds a burden he will carry to the widow. One knot-by-knot escalation suffices for this length, though the chess clock frame and the final reset feel cosmetic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the map-making ritual accumulates density, and the spire's song confirms acceptance. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights "innovation" as planting a question rather than control—but the cost remains oblique (no on-page action she forfeits or tactic she alters). One deepening (hesitation → coaxing) suffices at this length, yet the CR would benefit from a sharper on-page price to enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (copyist, ember alcove, shortwave radio, post-story-famine). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through broadcast risk, the girl's arrival, and the final broadcast, then reweights at closure when the phrase spreads citywide. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias vanishes and the city adopts the phrase, crystallizing the story-famine's end with undeniable pressure. Cost is oblique—Elias's disappearance is stated but not dramatized—and the Ministry's discovery reads as summary rather than scene. The lens holds, but the final third substitutes exposition for scene work, softening the closure beat's felt immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images—ashes, powder, mask fractures—that accumulate toward a pattern of deliberate dissolution and re-presentation. Orientation anchors (gallery, Liora kneeling, mask, ashes) arrive early and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora will continue this cycle in the next city, the mirage will hold "for now," and the cost is the perpetual fracture, the itinerant artist who never stops scattering. One meaningful deepening occurs when the powder reshapes the ashes into a recognizable ghost-portrait that patrons will debate. The inferred lens holds; cost is conceptual and felt in the repetition itself.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (sewer, Elias, workbench, chronometer cog). The piece follows a causal lens: Elias finds the cog → agonizes over preservation → Veyra warns of flooding → he builds his vault → confronts the Archives crew → chooses witness over escape. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias stands, the water rises, he understands witnessing trumps saving, and the cost is his life—legible in "The last thing he saw" and the clerk's dismissive record. One persistent constraint (the city's erasure machinery) shapes tactics and the final image. The cog "ticking" in silt delivers conceptual cost: the truth persists but unheard.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through layered images (rosette, autumn leaves, silences), the pattern of subtraction/unlearning is taught early, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the group hums the negative space where music used to be, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt in the thinned choir, the bullet-scarred folder, the tremor, and the acknowledgment that "they weren't a choir anymore." Orientation anchors (library, autumn, Elias at center table) land within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the contralto and others join the hum, reweighting the dominant stake from lost harmony to the possibility of it.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ruin-to-growth, memory-as-ingredient, pruning motif. Orientation anchors arrive late—greenhouse location and character name not established until several paragraphs in (−0.4). Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with charged final image), but cost remains largely conceptual and off-page: the rebellion is declared, not tested with visible stakes. The Great Alignment timeframe compresses urgency, yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. Escalation reads as thematic deepening rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the beehive failure accumulates pressure through sensory density (ozone, burnt sugar ink, crow's-eye seed) and cadence modulation, culminating in the drones' chaotic dance that reweights the city's relationship to wonder. Orientation anchors (toll keeper, tower, blackout timeframe) land by ~100 words. The riddle's answer ("wonder") provides conceptual repricing with visible cost—Elias empties the irreplaceable heirloom and accepts future disbelief. One meaningful deepening occurs when he climbs and plants the seed, transforming routine failure into invitation. Minor slip: the matchbox appearing "yesterday" and the seed's properties are told rather than discovered through present action, creating a brief causality seam.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Liora, bay dock, spring evening). Pressure accumulates through sensory density and the ritual arrangement, deepening toward the final image of carrying the hush with her. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she leaves the shard, accepting that witnessing rather than possessing is the path. Cost is implied in the renunciation but remains oblique; pointing to "she left the shard where it lay, knowing some things weren't meant to be kept" as the clearest cost marker. One meaningful deepening present; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Liora, drowned garden, watching for hours). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: three revelations cascade and reweight the human's certainty through density increase and pattern (city planted/child dreaming/waiting). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the ampoule becomes pigment, poison repurposed—with felt cost (drowning = welcome home). One modest causality slip: the dome's "almost-invisible seam" and the human's sudden ability to breathe water arrive without prior cue or cost, soft-resetting the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through pattern (staircase loop, dice, proof fragments) and accumulates density until the rupture moment when the chipped die stutters and reveals the flaw in the loop. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend): Lena presses the door, chooses the climb, accepts perpetual motion as choice rather than failure—cost is legible in leaving the smooth die and the café opportunity. Orientation anchors (Lena, staircase, gray haze) land within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening: the shift from "infinite" to "recursive with a flaw" reweights her understanding and tactics. Lens holds cleanly; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (moon, brush, leaf, script) toward a cadence shift when the painter finally sleeps and wakes to find transformation. Orientation anchors (rooftop greenhouse, smog city, forty-three nights) land early. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the painter's surrender to sleep with the brush worn down and air changed constitutes visible cost (exhaustion released, kindness passed forward). One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's laughter enters and the fig tree responds, reweighting the stakes from personal insomnia to collective memory.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens inferring: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accrues pressure through layered images (hands, voices, initials) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where shattering the lens disperses its power into communal practice. The final bread-baking passage reweights the opening hum with visible cost (the lens destroyed, the beekeeper absorbed). Orientation anchors within ~120 words (grotto city, museum, Liora). One tightening occurs when Liora discovers the trapped hands, escalating her task from preservation to rescue. The cost—giving up the singular magical object to empower the collective—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the yoyo, hunger stones, and lighthouse imagery build density toward the moment Elias steps through, and the final image of him "still spinning" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (the world lighter without him). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the hunger stones reframe as map, not warning—but the cost remains oblique (the sea "forgot his name") rather than viscerally felt, and the causality linking yoyo-spin to dimensional breach relies on atmospheric assertion more than earned mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the funhouse accumulates imagery—mirrors, filmstrip, luminance—that reweights at closure). Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final wink and the cloak-only photo reframe Lysander's relationship to fear and his cursed state. Cost is present but oblique: he now "carries the repulsive allure" and the game "remembered how to play," implying an ongoing burden. The orientation is clear (abandoned funhouse, post-resuscitation). One meaningful deepening occurs when he pulls the filmstrip and the funhouse "exhales." The Orientation Test is satisfied early. No causality breaks, but the closure's conceptual cost could be sharper—pointing to a visible trade-off on the page would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: successive strikes layer sensory and cosmic response until the sea answers and Leeward laughs. However, closure relies on assertion ("the thrill of the next note") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost; the protagonist's options and stance remain unchanged on the page. The sea's "voice" arrives as external event rather than earned consequence of prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern revelation (cracks as language, watchers as memory-keepers, gate as threshold) and coheres at closure when Elyas steps through and the gate "screams." Orientation is prompt (city, cartographer, watchers on horizon) by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elyas crosses to the watchers with the city beginning to move, reweighting the expedition's fate and his own waiting. Cost is felt in the whistle's dust and the city's trembling foundation, though the consequence remains poised rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Elias at a disused station with the Codex. The piece follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore links: he finds the ledger, photographs it, Callahan arrives, Elias counters with modern parallels, then exits. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he leaves with the photograph, "honest" at last—but the cost is more asserted ("finally, honest") than shown; no foreclosed path is dramatized on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Callahan calls the police, raising stakes briefly. The ending's resonance depends on metaphor rather than visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly: drawbridge, submerged pavilion, surveyor Elias. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered notes, inkwell inheritance, archival discovery, building toward a pattern of preservation. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: trading the inkwell for the Keeper's ledger and the final smile reweight his work from solitary to lineage-bound, with the conceptual cost (giving up the heirloom) legible. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovering the Keeper's notes mirror his own), sufficient for this length, though the cost feels more contemplative than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (Elias, sunken library, blackout). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: stillness → discovery → book with his name → choice to leave and continue work. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias returns to indexing with knowledge of surveillance/predestination but chooses not to share, foreclosing the path of revelation. The cost is legible in "some stillness wasn't meant to be shared" and his continued solitary work. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finds his own name recorded, reweighting his quest for honest origins into a confrontation with being observed or predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (lantern maker), where (floating isle, basilica, tea garden), and the inciting condition (shadow detached three nights prior) within the opening third. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density (gem installation, cranes taking flight, glass rippling) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the maker merges with the basilica, the isle ascends "into the place where dreams are kept," and prior grief-work reweights into transformation. The cost is felt (her physical dissolution, "becoming part of the recording") and conceptual (individual identity exchanged for collective dream-keeping). One causal ambiguity: why the gem's final installation triggers the descent-while-ascending effect at this moment is asserted more than motivated, leaving a small gap in because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with causal accent (geode→frequency→lattice→thread). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena sees the unmade past, feels the weight of potential, and steps into hunting mode—options crystallize and pressure is undeniable. Cost is conceptual (she forgoes fixing the past) and felt (the observatory dies, she exhales in darkness), legible in "She wasn't there to fix the past" and the final "hunting." One meaningful tightening occurs when she keys in the frequency and the lattice resolves. The three-week backstory block (~20% of text) anchors in present stimuli (hospital bed→morgue footage→field notes) and primes the console choice, satisfying BRR. No causality breaks; the "awaken" cue and harmonic frequency link prior setup to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the drone descent, chip placement, constellation reveal, and final hand-clasp, with the "missing piece" motif threading throughout. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes shared witness and the cost of no longer being alone, reweighting Lena's solitary surveillance mode. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chip slots into the seam, transforming the observatory from puzzle to answer. Cost is felt (Lena stops being surprised, lets the pilgrim take her hand) but remains more emotional than tactical, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: guilt accumulates through reflection and symbolic objects until the driftwood note forces a decisive tightening. The closure—Elias's decision to attend the meeting—constitutes a Decisive Change with legible cost: he must face the withheld truth and forfeit his seven-year penance routine. Orientation anchors (Elias, cobalt terrace, dusk) land early; the single-POV, two-location structure (terrace → shore → descent) remains coherent. One persistent objection: the note's appearance feels slightly convenient—Harkin's paper hidden in driftwood for seven years—but the causal chain from guilt to object to confrontation holds.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift: who (Elias Veyne, negotiator), where (storm-worn parapet above a chasm), and the dominant stake (prisoner exchange under moral pressure) anchor by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Causal: Elias's offer → Kaelis's memory of her brother → the deal → the boy's release. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelis picks up the drawer pull and the ghost of sibling love tips her decision. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the boy goes free, the war continues, and Elias walks away lighter—options have narrowed and a path is foreclosed. The ending image ("something quieter had won") lands the cost cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (who, where, when by the opening paragraphs) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's decision to navigate by poles rather than stars—a stance crystallization with visible cost (renouncing his navigator identity). The closure is on the page and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when he opens the letter and turns toward the post office, reweighting his self-conception. Deduction for minor causality convenience: the bartender encounter and whiskey scene feel like atmospheric padding rather than pressure nodes that advance the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements; the underground journey accumulates symbolic pressure toward a stance crystallization. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (starting over with the victim), but the cost remains largely implied rather than dramatically visible—we don't see what Liam sacrifices or forecloses by sitting down. The lake's mystical intervention and the baseball's portal function introduce late rules (water parts, path emerges) that weren't established early, weakening causal earn. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty applied there.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (bridge acceptance) with felt cost—Liora loses her human-only identity and gains porosity. Orientation anchors (orchard, moon, Liora's role) arrive early. Two conjuring attempts build pressure through intensification (nutmeg burns, dust-figure flickers), and the fortune crumbles to ash marking irreversible transformation. The brother's phantom line "It never is" and the final bridge moment reweight prior grief with conceptual cost, though the exact trade-off (what she loses by becoming the bridge) could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ink-tracing ritual and glade as reservoir, but the closure unit suffers from告told transformation rather than shown pressure. The saucer shatters and Liora "let[s] go" through a three-line list ("The satchel's clasp. / The knot in her chest. / The idea...") that declares change without demonstrating the foreclosed path or visible cost required for Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and the before/after is legible, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. The brother's exposition ("Time doesn't leave... It just waits") does thematic work but doesn't create the pressure reversal needed for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: Lien crosses the threshold, the dimension breathes, and the sealed world opens—a Decisive Change with visible cost (her stitches unravel, the Eulogy is gone). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring images (needle, thread, tear, photograph) that culminate in the final breach. Orientation anchors quickly (Lien, Eulogy observation deck, post-last-birth era). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tear widens and hands reach through, altering her options and enabling the push.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through image layering (volcano, bugs, prophecy, lava kiss) and the final island arrival reweights the premise with implied cost (empty hands, unnamed island). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elira steps onto new ground transformed, the whispering hush internalized, options narrowed but stakes crystallized. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reads the mirror shard and fulfills the prophecy accidentally. Cost is legible in the shift from "bottled lightning bugs" to "empty hands" and the erasure of footprints, though the conceptual price (what she forfeited beyond the vials) could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Kael's months of preparation (misplaced keys, malfunctioning gates) culminate in the blackout he engineered, leading to the armory breach and signal to the villagers. Orientation anchors (Kael, western gate, blackout) arrive early. The closure—lighting the signal,villagers ready, Kael vanishing—constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (the fort's grip broken, Kael now a fugitive). One meaningful tightening (dial aligned, hatch opened, armory yielded) is sufficient at this length, though the cost could be more embodied in the final image rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density increase and pattern recognition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the patterns held...the promise did not linger, but slept"). Orientation anchors who/where/aurora early; the "after friction disappears" premise is signaled but remains abstract until the mirror-water and eel return materialize it. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dust "snaps" the aurora into a ring and the eels coil around her wrists, reweighting her role from seeker to keeper. Cost is legible in "the dust settled into her bones" and the永續 cycle ("place more tomorrow"), though the promise's exact stakes remain oblique. Closure lands on the page with felt cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Elias is and why he climbed the observatory emerges gradually across the first third without clear anchoring stimulus. The closure unit (tearing the poem, letting the storm take it) reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible: we're told he feels lighter, but no prior scene established what specific path or relationship this act forecloses. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (storm imagery, darkroom memory, cartography motif), yet the ending's causal linkage is weak—nothing in the middle meaningfully tightened options or raised stakes. Apply −0.4 for orientation drift and −0.4 for cost that remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Elias and Liora, glass atrium, three-day wait, sundial duel. The drive lens reads Causal with situational pressure: needle card → shadow angle → hidden compartment → key, each beat motivated. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (partnership crystallized); cost is legible—Elias abandons solo vindication, accepts shared credit. One meaningful tightening when he realizes Liora carved the code twelve years prior narrows his options and reframes the negotiation. The "lock's been broken for decades" line undercuts the key's material necessity slightly but the relational shift holds.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story opens with spatial and temporal anchors (library awning, moon rising) and tracks a continuous scene through dawn. The closure—Elias giving Maren the violet and choosing to stay—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) that crystallizes his stance against the itch to molt, and the final image ("planting something fiercer than fire") reconfigures the opening restlessness with visible cost: he accepts rootedness. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through layered image (tin, violet, books) to a cadence shift at dawn. Mild deduction: the middle段 loops thematic statements ("beauty could outlast anarchy," "resistance that grew like vines") without new plot pressure, slightly blunting escalation before the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (tidal arbor, station piano, Lena) land cleanly in the opening lines. The story accumulates pressure through compasses flickering, film spliced with hidden path, projector stuttering to life, door manifesting, and the clock chiming—each beat reweights the stake (reunion vs. endless waiting) until the final image reconfigures longing into presence with felt cost (the arbor "suspended above the rules of endings"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the compasses still, the clock swings true, and Lena plays "not for the past, but for the encore," crystallizing her shift from retrospective grief to forward motion. Cost is legible in the line "She didn't look back when the projector sputtered out"—she forfeits the recorded past to enter the manifested refuge. One minor seam: the lover's sudden appearance risks convenience, but the story mitigates this by framing the reunion as Lena's construction (film, compasses, her willful act) rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal elements. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora becomes the island's voice, a transformation that reweights her role and forecloses her former identity with felt cost ("The island would forget her name eventually"). Orientation anchors early (ridge, Liora, nightshade, seeds). The because/therefore chain—seed consumption → vision → revelation → monsoon arrival → transformation—holds, though the middle beats compress quickly. One meaningful deepening when she understands the island is trying to remember *her* shifts stakes and narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias integrates the compass into the bonsai, crystallizing his stance toward grief with the image of blue leaves as held-back apology. The accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through tactile engagement with objects and memory, then shifts cadence at the planting moment. Cost is implied (he accepts the brother's absence, plants rather than searches) but the final paragraph's declaration "lighter than it had been in years" tells rather than shows the price paid. One additional image of what he's relinquished would anchor the cost more firmly on the page.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear and effective: flood → repeated visits and dust experiments → final decision to “listen” and take a sabbatical. Causality and motif build cleanly toward a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis closure where his research focus and stance are reweighted. The week’s passage and iterative dust use provide a gentle but legible tightening. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the only limit is the relatively low-external-pressure environment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: canyon → ledger → revelation about her brother → revaluation of purpose → renunciation of the ledger, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she moves from searching via objects and codes to inhabiting “pauses” and trusting her own perception, at the cost of a direct, tidy quest for her brother. The piece maintains a single, continuous scene with reflections tightly anchored to on-page stimuli (frost, fire, ledger). Stakes are modest but coherent and the before/after line—clinging to the ledger vs. letting it fall—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a largely accumulative/textural lens: world-breaking silence → experiment with case/piano → partial success → full, storm-altering performance → decision to return to the wreck. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the world rules (frozen air, sound as solid) are consistently applied without late-breaking cheats. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the world now hums with transformed silence, and Liora commits to re-entering the storm to raise the *Capriccio* in song. The cost (physical blood, emotional exposure, accepting the storm as “old collaborator”) is present on the page, though it’s more lyrical than gritty, keeping this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: package → recognition of the lens → disturbance in the ledger/world → decision to climb to the lighthouse → activation and resolution. The piece adheres to a single POV, one throughline of pressure, and lands a clear closure unit (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) when Elias restores the “signal” and then inscribes his own name. The cost—his acceptance of his own place among the dead, and the relinquishing of further “unfinished business”—is on the page. Structure is tight for the length, though resistance to his plan remains mostly atmospheric rather than concretely complicating his path.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine—from finding the bell, to the growth of the runs, to the burning of the arbor, to the open defiance on the altar—holds cleanly and escalates in a coherent arc. The piece blends montage and scene but keeps orientation and stakes legible. Closure is a strong Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: the bell is rehung, the wind assumes his role, and the cost of defiance under sanctions lingers. The only minor softness is how smoothly the patrols stand down, which trims some edge from the climax’s danger.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the viaduct → discovery of the jade → invocation through breath → revelation of the woman and past life → acceptance of a new role. Causality and lyric texture align; each step feels like an intensification of the same drive rather than a mere sequence of images. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias conceptually reprices “healing” and accepts custodianship of unused love, with the re-lit viaduct and rising embers marking a clear before/after. The cost is subtle but legible—he trades solitary seeking for ongoing responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Liora comes to unbuild, applies the halo, is pulled into a retrocognitive trap, realizes the nature of the maze, then escapes by discarding the device that made entry possible. The drive feels Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, but the because/therefore chain holds and the closure (discarding the halo, reorienting to “edges”) lands with cost. The structure is essentially one continuous escalation with a legible midpoint (entering the photograph) and a satisfying reconfiguration at the end. Nothing crucial is left unresolved or patched retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is clean: wall trembles → Lena moves → key/arrow puzzle → vault opens → guard complication → improvised trap → planting and departure. The piece achieves an RR/CR closure, reweighting “liberation” from tearing down walls to seeding resilience, with the cost (years imprisoned, risk of this mission, leaving pockets empty) visible. Structure is mostly one continuous operation plus a brief epilogue-like planting sequence, which still feels like a single arc. There are no major unkept set-ups; the only slight softness is how smoothly the heist and escape proceed, with minimal setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from cold forge to rekindling, to the climactic imprinting, to the choice to walk into the tide, with each beat tightening the emotional premise. Causality is legible under a lyric lens—lighting the forge and using the last coal precipitates the greenhouse’s trembling and the need to leave. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines “trust breaking” and reorients his life toward “listening to the rust,” with the cost of abandoning this place and its ghosts. Some world mechanics (how imprints function, why the aurora responds) remain intentionally mysterious, which suits the mode but keeps it just shy of flawless structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: flower-code observation → lock opening → mirror revelation → realization about the portraits → choice to weaponize the moonbeams → transformed fate. Structure holds as a single, continuous scene with one dominant drive, and the conceptual repricing at the end (light remains, she doesn’t) gives a legible before/after. Some mechanics of the magic (how portraits as countdowns interact with the mirror and the jar) remain slightly abstract, so a reader has to accept a bit of fable-logic rather than crisp rule-logic. Still, closure is on-page and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine—return to the control room → discovery of the second bookmark and “controlled collapse” plan → decision to finish the work → activation and departure—is clear and satisfying, with closure landing as both a decisive act and a reweighted understanding of “safe zone.” The accumulative lyric texture (memories, motifs of thaw and glass) builds toward this choice without muddling orientation. Cost is legible in her refusal to stay and in the relinquishing of the old sanctuary, though the off-page consequences of the flood remain somewhat abstract, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: betrayal and erasure lead to the library, the girl’s cast reframes the situation, the shell’s voice directs her to the ledger, and securing it produces an on-page decisive change in her options and self-conception. The piece holds a coherent causal drive lens without ambiguity and lands closure through both concrete gain (proof in the ledger) and internal reconfiguration. Cost is legible in her blood on the shell and the emotional reckoning with being “erased,” not just asserted. The single-scene structure is tight, with no orientation issues or dangling set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: Eldrin arrives with a goal, iteratively “retells” silences, and the ending delivers a conceptual repricing when he realizes the map is erasure and joins it. Causality under this lens holds—storm → hush → retellings → realization → release of the booklet → self-dissolution—without any orientation issues. Cost is present but subtle: he relinquishes both the tool of his obsession and his separate self in exchange for becoming part of the night’s map. It’s structurally sound and satisfying, though the price is more metaphysical than emotionally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: courtyard → violin note → temporal visions → void of past lives → return, with a clear conceptual before/after. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “second chance” is redefined as restoration of selfhood, with visible cost in the loss of the janitor-only simplicity. Transitions into and out of the void are legible, if deliberately abstract, and all major turns grow from the act of playing. The structure is tight for the length, though some beats (e.g., pocket of time explanation) lean on exposition rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: quiet lobby → arrival of the couple → drawing/transfer of the ticket → widened practice and dawn. Causality is modest but coherent—hearing the couple leads directly to the drawing, which then becomes the template for her ongoing choices. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lena’s relationship to her own “cryptic” work conceptually reprices from mistrust to clarity, with a visible shift in future behavior (leaving tickets for others). Stakes are small-scale but legible and resolved without loose threads or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense polishing and accusation anchored by a single scene, with backstory about the earlier accusations interleaved smoothly. Causality is coherent—measurable luck leads to suspicion, exile, and finally the demonstration with the marbles—and the shift from ledgers to listening lands as on-page closure. The cost (abandoning the security of tallies and embracing a less quantifiable relationship) is legible, though gently rendered. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, and the piece maintains that lens consistently through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: one coherent lab scene where Elias activates the nexus, destabilizes the field, and sends K‑11 “elsewhen,” culminating in his reconfigured stance toward time. Causality is clean—adjust nexus → field warps → aviary remembers → K‑11 transitions—and the closure beat (resting his hand on the lever, accepting time as something to step through) reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (rule violation, loss of specimen). The drive lens feels Hybrid (causal sequence plus lyric culmination) and holds consistently. The story could push the sense of concrete consequence a bit harder—what he’s truly risking beyond protocol breach remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: pattern of signs → deciphered instruction → retrieval of key/program → ghostly “duet” → reconfigured stance at dawn. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent, with each coded sign tightening the invitation to engage. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after—opera house as tomb vs duet—is legible. Stakes are primarily existential/artistic, which suits the piece but keeps the sense of risk fairly low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in the station, with a clear present-time spine (after the fever, just before the storm breaks). The global drive reads as accumulative/situational: sense data, backstory, and instruments’ behavior build pressure until the revelation that the storm will hit now, forcing a stance. Closure is strong: Liora’s decisive non-warning and exit into the storm constitute a clear before/after with cost, and the observatory’s waiting static locks that in. The storm destroying the station remains off-page, and causal stakes for other people are mostly implied rather than enacted, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a single, coherent causal chain: father’s confession → Elias investigates → sensory and psychic disturbances mount → he turns the wheel → apparition → altered stance at exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he cannot undo what he’s seen, but chooses to carry the “truth” symbolically in the wheel and step into a new role. Causality holds and there are no orientation issues; the world’s loose supernatural logic is consistent enough to support the climax. The only limitation is that the concrete price of his act remains more conceptual than materially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: approach library → enter refuge via swan → interior witnessing → return to decayed library and resume ritual, forming a coherent loop. Causality is legible even in a lyric mode (the swan opens the refuge; the refuge reshapes the keeper; time/river deepen erosion). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the keeper has effectively renounced ordinary identity and committed to endless waiting. Stakes and cost (self-erasure, buried name) are conceptually clear, though pressure stays mostly low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: early seeding of Sage Ridge and Elias’s practice leads to Mira’s stalled progress, which in turn motivates the eclipse trip and the decisive act of giving her the vial. The eclipse scene functions as a focused climax, followed by a brief but effective denouement where the new song and later client recontextualize events. Closure is solid: Mira hums, the ridge “sings back,” Lila relinquishes the vial, and Elias’s role reframes. The cost is modest and mostly conceptual, but legible enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: the tapestry’s arrival → investigation with diaries → the axis shift → Elias’s decision to leave form a coherent arc. Causality is legible and accumulative rather than plot-twist driven, suitable for the lyric mode, and the closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (abandoning the silo to follow the stories outward). The Sundering backstory is integrated via the diaries in a way that supports the present action rather than derailing it. Stakes remain more conceptual than situational, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine—microdot arrives → threat announced → orchestration of handoff → departure—holds cleanly, and the piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Chen abandons the lighthouse, the fortunes and “open secrets” pattern continues without him. The hybrid drive (largely accumulative/textural with enough causal linkage) is stable to the end, and the closing images (“lighthouse dark,” “What you seek was never hidden”) reweight prior material with conceptual cost. The stakes stay intimate and somewhat cool on the page, but there is a legible before/after break in both his role and the island’s warning system.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the priest arrives pre-possession, uses palette and pedal to expose the anchor’s lie, accepts dissolution, and the novice takes up the pattern. Causality is largely conceptual but coherent—each move (looping silence, spreading indigo) deepens the reconfiguration of the anchor. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the anchor shifts from prison to question, with the cost of the priest’s disappearance and the possession’s new difficulty. The brief shift to the novice in the hall of forgotten doors is legible and serves the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build from night work to dawn revelation, with memories embedded but always anchored to present stimuli (the shell, the lake, the intercom). Causality is soft but coherent: writing fortunes → feeling their weight → sensory prompts (ice, shell fracture, horizon) → decision to stop writing and “conduct” instead. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from passive oracle to active maker, with the city’s expectations and the waiting courier as understated costs. The only thing holding this back from the very top tier is that the cost of this pivot remains mostly implied rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: Elias on the viaduct with the tablet, triggering sidewise rewinds, confronting another self, merging, and breaking the loop. World rules (procedural regeneration, retracing) are sketched efficiently and applied consistently enough for the climax to read. Closure is solid—a decisive change with cost: the tablet destroyed, power gone, and the viaduct vanished. The only limitation is that some high-level concepts (labyrinth of self across generations) are gestured at more than concretely dramatized, so the structural stakes feel a shade more mythic than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: Elias arrives in the cavern carrying his emblem of failure, encounters the drum maker and the backward record, experiences a reconfigured way of “hearing,” and leaves with a new teaching stance. Causality holds throughout (needle → cavern visit → backward songs → decision to teach differently), and the transition to the village/future children is clear and motivated. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes silence and his vocation, with the “door” image solidifying a before/after. Stakes are modest but coherent; one slightly sharper on-page obstacle or hesitation in the middle could have intensified the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean causal spine under an accumulative/textural lens: being followed → pigeon’s arrival → note → recontextualization of the quarantine zone → charged final poise as he records silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his practice of listening is reweighted by the knowledge that the anomaly is learning and possibly encroaching. Stakes are mainly conceptual and anticipatory, but the chain is coherent and cost (to safety and solitude) is legible. It falls a bit short of elite because no beat forces a concrete tactical adjustment beyond “listen differently.”

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: greenhouse/mother’s vial → uncorking → memory/realization of the Luminara’s feeding → decision to stop feeding it → smashing lanterns and leaving. Structure is essentially one continuous scene with a brief but anchored childhood flashback, then a short aftermath shard; the transitions are smooth and time/place are always legible. Closure is an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing combination: he refuses to be a door for predatory memory-flowers, and this choice reweights everything that came before. The only minor limitation is that the transformation’s external stakes (for the world or the species) remain largely conceptual, keeping the arc more intimate than maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: grotto → rope discovery → energy beings’ involvement → resonance snap → conceptual vision → ladder and departure gives a clear before/after. Causality within this lyric frame is coherent (rope hum → beings respond → he chooses to pull, then carve), and the closure—ladder left behind, question carried forward—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt conceptual cost. Orientation is solid from the opening paragraphs, and the world’s “after the prisons emptied” logic stays consistent. The one limitation is that the global drive is more contemplative than pressured, which slightly softens structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: solitary playing → intrusion by the child → shared improvisation → dawn charged with a forward-or-stay choice. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the hush, bowl, fire, and music steadily reweight the central stake of whether beauty can persist and be passed on. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Liora begins “the first note of tomorrow,” and the hush “learned to sing,” signaling a reconfigured status quo with implied cost of leaving solitude behind. The cost is more emotional and conceptual than situational, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: client arrives with a specific commission, Liora tests the petal, discovers the half-truth in what he wants, then makes a different use of the object that forces a truer outcome. The drive is largely accumulative/textural—transformation and dusk deepening alongside the emotional reveal—but the decision to apply the petal to herself is a clear pivot. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the chemist leaves altered, Liora recommits to her role with fuller understanding of loneliness and half-truths. The cost is emotional rather than situational and could be made slightly sharper, but it is present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: symphony → courtyard watching → found envelope → misaddressed note → midnight meeting → joint scheme. The locket coincidence (photo match and engraved initial) is highly convenient but thematically coherent enough not to break plausibility at this length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s brokerage skills are repurposed toward quiet redistribution, with the ledger line hinting at ongoing cost. Structure is straightforward and efficient, though the central turn comes easily, with little structural complication or setback.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: need for a dedication → discovery of the tag → decision to search → communal quest → encounter with Syl → communal completion of the arbor → quiet revaluation at the crater. Causality holds without cheats, and the accumulative pattern of tags and communal involvement builds smoothly to the closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Reed’s understanding of belonging shifts from object/place to current/practice, with the final image of her hand on the arbor and the crater’s hum. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, but for this length they’re coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece runs on a mostly causal, single-scene spine: missing moths and warped time lead Elspeth to the rooftop canals, to the boy, to the offer/threat, to the sacrifice of the jar, to partial restoration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city remains unstable but breathing, the boy is gone, the moths are freed, and her task reframes from repair to stewardship. The main structural weakness is the late, almost ex machina reveal of the jar’s function; it works symbolically but isn’t fully set up, softening the sense of tightly earned resolution. Still, the before/after of the city’s state and her role in it are legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → ritual with the mosaic and eyes → near-contact with the wife’s presence → acceptance and departure, with each beat deepening the central stake. The closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing, where he relinquishes the need to “solve” grief and revalues remembering over preserving. Causality is soft but consistent within the lyric frame (the eyes into the mosaic trigger the orchard’s brief reanimation and the mist). Cost is legible in his acceptance of ambiguity and his choice to leave the cavern with lighter satchel but enduring hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: unusual outage → Elias’s rule-breaking impulse → tape deployment → her recognition → photo drop → his emergence and offer of the key. Structural scope is tight—a single scene with interleaved backstory that always tilts the present, particularly the festival memory that justifies the tape and photo’s existence. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change: Elias steps into the light and hands over the key, reconfiguring both characters’ futures at a real, if understated, cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the situational pressure is coherent from first flicker to steadying lights.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear accumulative arc: long-term observation → anomalous behavior → microscope revelation → conceptual insight → embodied shift in behavior. Causality is coherent—the storm season and the linden’s response directly trigger Liora’s realization and new stance toward the nursery. Closure lands as a decisive change in how she runs the nursery and relates to growth, with visible implied cost (risking business norms and control). The structure is straightforward and tight, if somewhat gentle in terms of external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: brooch → chapel groove → stair → amber woman → vision → paintbrush → new painting → brooch’s return. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elias recognizes the brooch was an offering and re-understands the wars, his insomnia, and his art as the island’s awakening process. The drive lens reads as hybrid (causal with a strong accumulative/thematic overlay) and holds to the end. The only limitation is the relative ease of his choices under pressure—events sometimes feel fated more than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → contact with the pearl → encounter/vision → departure changed. Causality is intact and legible, with the pearl as the hinge event and the entity’s revelation as the central turn. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she renounces the object and her old way of practicing clairvoyance with a felt cost but also gain. Stakes remain mostly internal and philosophical, but for this scale they resolve with satisfying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the valve → workshop compilation → community contributions → council ship’s arrival → choice to pass the valve on. Causality is soft but coherent, with each beat deepening the central drive rather than adding new threads. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias abandons the role of herald and redefines the city’s recovery as an act of listening, with the cost implicit in stepping back from the center. The pattern is taught early and sustained without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: cracks → vault → punch → question → confession → station vision → renunciation/return to city. The global drive feels hybrid (causal spine with accumulative imagery), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he reorients from “solve the mystery” to “carry and name it,” with a visible cost in refusing the platform. Setups (ticket punch, cracks, hour-lock) all pay off without glaring loose threads. The arc is simple but fully legible at this length, with no orientation or lens ambiguity debt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: tile → transcription → apparition → inward stretching → renunciatory letting-go. Cause and effect remain legible even in the lyric mode, and the closure—a reconfigured stance toward grief and listening—lands clearly with conceptual cost. The piece flirts with repetition in the late-middle (multiple beats of transcription/memory/whale-song layering) that don’t always raise stakes, but the throughline never blurs. The final opening of the tower’s door for others elegantly seals the arc without mechanical over-tying.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: solar storm → amulet activation → corridor → dropping the fragment → transformation and conceptual repricing of “goodbye.” Orientation is strong from the opening; who/where/when and the core situation are legible and stay coherent despite the surrealism. Closure lands clearly: the world’s geometry and Lysander’s stance both reconfigure with a visible before/after, though the cost is more implied (loss of the escondite, of his old mode of existing) than concretely dramatized. The main limit is that escalation in options and constraint is relatively gentle, with little sense of narrowing choices or irreversibility until the drop itself.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: stolen ledger → magical ink pot → attempt to erase debts → refugee girl’s warning → completing the names → system-breaking backlash → flight. The dominant stake (twelve refugees vs. Lira’s culpability) is legible and the climax—the pot shattering and rewriting the room’s rules—lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing. The closure unit is clear: Lira abandons the ledger logic and chooses solidarity, with cost implied in unleashed chaos and coming pursuit. Some consequences (what happens to the refugees, the minister) are left off-page, but this reads as purposeful openness rather than structural evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: quiet workshop → anomalous hum → discovery of Elara → dawn recommitment to his practice. Causality under a textural lens holds: the changed hum prompts action, which yields a new life/story and recharges his ongoing project. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—the sense that his work is justified and ongoing—rather than a decisive change, and the cost of this path (what he foregoes) is only lightly implied. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, vignette structure is clear and coherent under a textural drive lens: rumors → deeper roaming → sleeplessness → ledger discovery → tidal offering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Daniel inserts the bundle into the container and accepts the labyrinth’s recognition in place of civil existence. Causality is soft but consistent; each beat grows out of the previous one’s obsession rather than coincidence. A sharper hinge or on-page dilemma at the ledger discovery could elevate sense of structural inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: observatory → dissolving journal/time pressure → escalating music/voices → conceptual turn about the riddle’s nature. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he abandons solving in favor of contributing, with the blank shell and self-inked line marking a before/after. Causality is coherent at a lyric level (each sound experiment deepens the response), and the time constraint from the vanishing journal shapes his tactics. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and metaphysical, so the felt cost at the end, while present, is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear causal throughline: arrival at the mural, encoding a warning, escalating to the clocktower defacement, and sealing it with the foundation chip. The pressure of the coming surveyors and replacement of the clocktower gives a clean situational deadline, and the closure is a charged poise where Elira chooses her side and method. The cost and consequences remain mostly projected rather than partially paid on the page, which keeps the structural arc strong but not yet bracing. No orientation or lens issues impede coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, a clear three-hour countdown, and the canister’s timed glows marking progression. Causality is coherent (he plants the canister, photographs, the dawn and drones approach) and the drive is accumulative, building texture and inevitability. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: he departs, the crater’s fate sealed, but the photographs and sand grain reweight what happened. Stakes remain intimate and quiet, which fits the mode, though the final turn is more conceptual than decisively plot-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias detects an invisible problem, confirms it through multiple methods, intervenes, then returns to his ongoing work, giving the piece a satisfying arc of detection–repair–continuance. The story adheres to a single continuous scene with one clear drive, and the closure—a quiet earned stasis as he resumes mending smaller things—lands. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic (his work remains unseen and uncredited), but it’s legible in the way he simply turns back to his shop. Slightly higher stakes or a more strenuous path to the fix would push this further.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: falcon returns → investigation of Kael’s materials → recognition of pattern → deliberate engagement with the lake → transformative crossing. Causality is solid under a hybrid causal/textural lens, and the closure—Lena stepping forward as herald while rivers elsewhere reverse—is legible with conceptual and implied personal cost. Orientation is handled efficiently early on (outpost, frozen lake, Lena’s profession and the missing hydrologist), and the prophetic phrase pays off when the lake’s “breath” stills and speaks. The only small limitation is that the transition from “she wasn’t supposed to be here” to full commitment is swift, with little on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: he enters, begins the walk, sound spreads, the town responds in stages, and the closure lands with the child’s laughter and his decision to continue. The causal chain is subtle but coherent—each use of the fork and each step broaden the revival—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he commits to unending maintenance, with the cost of perpetual work legible on the page. There are no orientation issues or broken setups; the only limitation is the relatively low on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: descent and ritual in the temple, the hush event, then a brief aftermath that reframes the experience. Causality is coherent—her prior distress signal draws her back, the vial and plate trigger the hush, and that encounter leads to her later renunciation of diving and the signal. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: she refuses the call and accepts the cost of living with loss rather than trying to undo it. The three-day gap and “rebreathed still half-full” lean a bit on unexplained magic, but they support the accumulative, uncanny lens rather than breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias enters with the lattice, extracts his father’s name, the bodies are found as foretold, and he returns to continue the pattern. The piece teaches its slightly lyric, accumulative pattern early and maintains it while still honoring cause-and-effect (lattice → names → blue light → fatalities/curse). Closure is strong: his truthful “Nothing” and the continuing deaths constitute a clear before/after with conceptual and moral cost. No setup is left dangling, and the two-shard structure (night visit / noon discovery + return) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: bead → return → greenhouse reaction → Vesper’s emergence → bead’s destruction/Liora’s dissolution → altered orchard. The embedded backstory about the debt and Vesper’s earlier death is economical and directly informs the present action. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the debt is “paid for now,” Liora is gone, and Vesper + orchard occupy a new charged stasis, with cost on the page. Structure is essentially a single continuous scene with lyric infill, and no beats feel unkept or retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: tide recedes → sleepwalking through labyrinth → Heart Chamber revelation → dawn departure. Causality is clear within a lyric frame: his repeated sleepwalking and use of the plate cause the labyrinth to reconfigure, leading to a decisive change in both space and self-understanding. Closure is strong—a before/after hinges on waking, choosing to walk awake, and heading toward the wharf with a new tool and role, with a felt cost of leaving the labyrinth’s protection. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a coherent causal throughline and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: return → catacomb work → seed → planting in sundial → sapling cracking stone → renewed journey, with each step motivated and legible. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, but causal links still hold, and the closure—a new tree breaking stone and Elias choosing to continue—constitutes a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is gentle and mostly implied (labor, emotional vulnerability, committing to the work) rather than sharply dramatized. Structure is tight and single-threaded, but the resolution leans on grace/miracle more than a pressured choice, keeping it short of elite-level rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene moving from receiving the request to generating the name to mailing it and wiping the chalk, with each step causally linked. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds quietly via layered details of method and preference until the mailbox hesitation and release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the act of mailing and erasing crystallizes her role as someone who moves through the world “without leaving ripples.” Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but the before/after is legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: warning → choice to stay and act → activation of telescope/flame → early arrival of enforcers → destructive but victorious climax. Closure is strong, with both a decisive change (the coup’s lies exposed by dawn) and a conceptual repricing (stories as the true power). There are no orientation issues; time, place, and stakes are clear very early. The only modest limitation is that the mechanics of “unraveling the coup” remain somewhat abstract, but the emotional and conceptual cost still land.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single nocturnal journey into the mangroves that tightens around one decision about the unsent letter. Each step (entering the labyrinth, invoking words in condensation, the spirits’ question, the shard’s healing) coheres under a situational/accumulative lens and narrows her options emotionally. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change: she abandons the fetishized limbo and steps into a stance of readiness and openness, with the letter’s release as concrete act and cost. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, though the external stakes remain very quiet by design.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: present-tense pressure (the cast, then the boy) is anchored early and each beat logically follows from Lena’s role and wounds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—Lena recommits to walking into the mist of “other broken things,” despite her ribs “singing.” Causality is subtle rather than plotty but coherent: each new supplicant appears because her capacity to “unknot” has been established. The only brake on a higher score is that the central drive (what exactly Lena risks or might refuse) remains more conceptual than dramatically hinged on a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery of the fragment → experimental transfer in the studio → public display in the orchard → brief reanimation and revaluation of the ruin. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, building atmosphere and communal presence toward a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands clearly with the orchard reframed as promise, but the price for achieving this is relatively soft (ephemerality rather than a sharp loss), which moderates the impact. Structure is otherwise tight, with one clear transition and no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine—nickel → sound activation → mural-portal awakenings → realization → door-painting → passage—is coherent and easy to follow within an accumulative, slightly dreamlike structure. The nested awakenings risk redundancy but each iteration adds information (different interlocutor, time of day, “you’re late” / “again” refrains) that reweights the situation. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: the cycle reframed from trap to invitation, extended explicitly to the reader via the nickel. Costs (Liora’s departure, her fading fresco) are present, though held at a conceptual rather than visceral level.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: a world where thoughts are taxed → Elias creates a plant-code resistance → the system begins to catch on (“they know”) → the network accelerates into open defiance (“now”). The time jump (“Three weeks later”) is clean and the beats progress logically from planning to first contact with danger to activation. Closure lands as a charged poise / conceptual repricing: the world’s rules are the same, but the balance of power has shifted as language goes feral in the soil. The main limitation is that the cost remains mostly conceptual and offstage—no specific consequence lands in the final beat beyond implied escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural drive, layering images and micro-events until the closing cocoon/“Alchemy of Staying” beat reconfigures the premise with clear conceptual cost. Causality is coherent within its lyric mode: the postcard’s ensconcing, the ghost encounter, the manual, and the letters all build toward the net-snared sun and her final “rest.” There is solid closure via resonant reconfiguration—she shifts from ceaseless output to a charged, listening stasis. A minor limitation is that escalation is more atmospheric than decisively structural, keeping it just short of elite tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and causal: tending → attempt to repair → unintended awakening → struggle → decisive destruction, all in one coherent scene. Closure is solidly on the page: she chooses to invert her lifelong mission and accept a new stance, with visible consequences in the ruined library and her emptied role. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a strong causal spine, and the before/after is legible and costly. No orientation debt; the opal library, Liora’s role, and the chime’s importance are all anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: her attempt to “unsnarl” the Chorus with truth-ink triggers the loom-like awakening, the inkwell shattering, and the archive’s transformation before the emissaries arrive. The piece uses an accumulative/lyric structure but still lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the archive becomes a living chorus and Elara’s relationship to her work and voice is reweighted. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than concretely dramatized (we feel the risk and responsibility more than a tangible loss), which slightly softens impact at this elite bar. Structure holds as one coherent scene with rising pressure and no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is solid: search → discovery of hidden system → ethical reinterpretation of the past → confrontation with elders and declaration of a new path. The structure is cleanly two-part (amphitheater then council), with a decisive change at the end where Liora refuses the “nothing found” script. Closure is present and legible, but the resolution with the elders is somewhat frictionless—their near-immediate nod undercuts a sense of real cost or resistance. Still, for this length, the arc holds together with coherent stakes and a believable before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: Marseille letter/meteorite as inciting prod, Madame Holloway’s pressure as grounding counter-beat, then the night’s vigil culminating in sending the pigeon and humming again. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each concrete action (pocketing the meteorite, pinning the letter, dispatching the bird) tightens his options toward reconnection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts that some “paper trails” can be rewritten and reopens the path to Luca and music, with visible cost in vulnerability. Stakes remain intimate and quiet; there’s no major structural misstep, but the turn from stasis to action could be sharpened with one more concrete on-page risk or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the logbook → noticing the terrace grain → discovering the husk and note → running to the sinkhole → ladder descent and reunion, with each step tightening the search. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and the hybrid causal/lyric pattern stays coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the “center” is redefined, and Elias’s stance changes as he joins Liora conceptually rather than extracting her. The only softening is how little real resistance the final descent faces, which slightly undercuts the missing-child peril set up earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: accumulative build in one main underwater sequence plus a brief surface shard, all driving toward the respite and the parting at sunrise. Causality is modest but coherent—Elara’s long project leads her to witness the jellyfireflies, which enables connection with Kael, which reframes her stance on staying below. Closure via Resonant Reconfiguration is solid: she chooses to remain, archivally fixing the respite in her log and symbolically shelving the feather. Stakes and turns are more tonal than event-driven, but they land.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: following the bird/seeds → reading the glass → realizing her own connection → accepting the memories → leaving the cave. Causality is clear enough in a lyric mode and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with new knowledge and burden, and the cave seals, marking a before/after. The “time is a thief here” clock and the bird’s *hurry* introduce pressure but never quite sharpen into a concrete risk beyond abstraction. Still, nothing important teleports or unravels, and the conceptual arc from missing paths to internalized completion is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous scene that builds toward the orchestrated coincidence of the torch’s guttering and the crowd’s gasp aligning with his cadence. Causality within the chosen lens is solid—each environmental element he notices is folded into the “composition,” culminating in the timed climax. Closure arrives via a conceptual reweighting (order hiding inside randomness) and an earned stasis: he recommits to his ongoing game under slightly altered terms. Stakes and cost are modest but legible, so the structure works well, if not transcendently.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative ritual: preparation → observation of gaps → inscription → transformed stance. Causality is coherent under a textural lens (each step deepens the same drive) and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she “had fledged at last…She would call it home.” Cost (the sea’s permanent loss vs this new belonging) is legible and on the page. There are no orientation issues; time, place, and stakes are clear early and held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: dawn → atrium ritual → reading the water → small revelation → re-entry into the workday. Causality is subtle but coherent—throwing the stone and reading the ripples gives him knowledge about the day and emotionally repositions him before the boats arrive. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Elias maintains his ritual in the face of change, with the cost implied in his daughter’s absence and the bay’s amnesia. Stakes are modest but fully resolved within the chosen scale.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: ridge walk → handling box → opening it → drawing → texting → leaving the box → descending, with each move deepening rather than laterally repeating. Closure is clear and on-page: Elias both reaches out to Lila (photo + flame emoji) and relinquishes the relic, then physically chooses the untouched valley, marking a before/after stance. Causality is intact under a textural lens; every step arises from what preceded (the call leads to box, box to memory, memory to drawing and outreach). Stakes and cost are modest but coherent and legible at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural arc cleanly: physical cues (gauge, decorations, tide) progressively reweight the central idea of hope/potential. Closure is strong as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—Liora’s relationship to hope, the grotto, and her grandfather’s “trial balloon” is clearly different by the end. Causality is soft but coherent within the lyric mode; each new phenomenon (needle movement, revitalized patterns) grows logically from prior beats. The main ceiling is that stakes and costs, while present, remain largely conceptual and gently pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous sequence that moves from corridor entry to shrine discovery to reconfigured relationship with memory. Causality is tight—each new echo or object (hum, negative, door, mural) leads logically to the next choice, and the realization that “the walls didn’t just dream. They remembered.” is both earned and decisive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his role shifts from mapmaker of echoes to active participant in his family’s remembered life, with a clear before/after. The cost (accepting the legacy and its pain) is legible without being overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: terrace → client setup → current working → cost and release → exit, all under the bell-clock frame, with no orientation issues. Causality is soft but coherent (client’s plea → heartbeat acquisition → mirage creation → heartbeat unraveling), and the ending provides an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure where Liora recommits to her pattern at real cost to self. The dominant drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, and the final beat clearly recasts the whole ritual as an ongoing, morally ambivalent equilibrium. The only slight limitation is that the inciting request and its fulfillment feel a touch pre-ordained rather than pressured into a sharper on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scene is cleanly structured: clear present-time negotiation framed by a long history of repeated treaties, building to Kael’s decision to sign. Causality under a situational lens is coherent: his resistance is worn down by the ritual, the shared memory, and the evocation of “the children we haven’t buried yet,” leading to the signature as the decisive change. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: the war ends here while the larger cycle persists, and Veyra recommits to paying this ongoing cost. The only limitation is that the middle does not significantly complicate the initial trajectory; it deepens texture more than it tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a walk into the salt flat, accumulated backstory, a single central choice, and an exit toward the storm. Causality is intact—his prior creation of the drought produces the salt flat that enables this particular form of confession—and the closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing (legacy vs confession). Cost is legible in his abandonment of “cost” as his guiding metric for this one act. Escalation is subtle but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: untangling each thread releases a different echo, escalates the sanctuary’s response, and culminates in entry to the vault and the sealing of the gates behind her. Orientation is strong from the opening—who, where, and what she’s doing are legible almost immediately. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits transformed, carrying the echoes within her while the sanctuary is now closed to others but its knots permanently loosened. The cost—being sealed in with the echoes and bearing their weight—reads clearly in the final images of her humming body and single trail of footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a tight, accumulative aftermath: bar conflict → retreat to dome → reflection through objects and setting → conceptual decision about how to perform tomorrow. Causality is coherent, and the closure (changing his performance ethic) lands clearly as a before/after shift with a modest but legible cost. The story leans heavily on reflection over on-page action, but it remains anchored and doesn’t drift. Stakes feel scaled to an internal, artistic dilemma, which is apt but limits the sense of structural urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one continuous span from construction through unraveling to recommitment, with no orientation or causality slips. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the migration is over but the “remembering” continues through his signals, at a clear conceptual and emotional cost. Stakes and pattern are coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, though a slightly stronger middle turn in his stance would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each step (card → rope → light → names → departure) deepens the same central drive without digression, and the closure lands in her reframed understanding of preservation and self-forgiveness. Causality is legible and smooth—her specific ritual actions produce the tremor, light, and chorus of names, leading directly to her emotional shift and decision to leave. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: before, she equates preservation with static holding; after, she allows transformation, at emotional cost, and walks away lighter but marked. There are no orientation or lens issues; if anything, the arc is almost too tidy, but it remains earned by what’s on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive at bunker → activate decayed system → confront dream-film → murals reconfigure → world reconfigures. Causality is more accumulative than strictly linear, but each beat follows coherently from the last and the closure (single path, ash seal, storm breaking) reads as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of the premise. The cost—sacrifice of certainty and acceptance of being chosen—is legible but a bit abstract, more thematic than situational. Nothing crucial feels mechanically patched or withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: tile discovery → study → realization of key → activation of passage → altar encounter → conceptual shift at the observatory. The structure is linear and legible with one main scene plus a brief analytic interlude, and the drive lens remains causal through to the conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands as a clear before/after in his relationship to the cosmos, though the material stakes of choosing to go below (danger, sacrifice) are somewhat soft. All set-ups (tile, palace, overseers, altar inscription) are paid off without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clear: Lior brings the broken box to the sanctuary to shed resentment, confronts Kael’s apparition, and chooses to reinsert the pin, triggering the return of sound and reconciliation. The sanctuary’s shifting reality reads as a consistent, accumulative pressure rather than a rule-breaking convenience. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the brothers’ stance toward each other and silence changes, with the music box left behind as a foreclosed path. Some world-logic (how exactly this place works) remains deliberately fuzzy, but it doesn’t undercut the emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: a single accumulative scene in the orchard that moves from encounter with the broken sextant to ritual, vision, and crossing into the sky. Causality is soft-lyric but intact—his choice to perform synchronized breathing and embrace the fog leads to the sextant’s restoration, orchard transformation, and the door-like sky. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sky shifts from boundary to portal, and he chooses to step through, abandoning his old stasis. The cost of leaving his life/workshop is implied rather than dramatized, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story holds a clean single-scene spine (arrive/dig/find/plant/reprice) with one reflective band that’s well anchored (“They remembered the day the priests had come”). Causality is tight: finding the box leads to planting the seed, which immediately reconfigures knowledge through the sprout and orchard-voice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mender shifts from contractual obedience to a more organic, mutual vow, with on-page cost in surrendering their prior moral certainty. Stakes remain intimate and quiet, but the before/after is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: cameo arrival → bathroom resonance → orchard/library encounter → choice of how to engage → reset with altered understanding. The closure works as a conceptual repricing: she accepts her role in a cycle, changing from would-be classifier/destroyer to a more responsible steward. Stakes and options evolve logically with no teleports or reversals that feel unearned. The cost is more implied than dramatized, but the “For the next one who asks” recursion lands with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: theft of the diary → repeated attempts → arrival and manipulation of the traveler → opening of the door via the spoken name → trap reversal that costs Elias his prize and memory. The story maintains a clear present-time throughline with brief, purpose-tied backstory that informs current tactics, and the spatial logic of the bookstore/door is legible. Closure is solid—a conceptual repricing where the Library’s nature and Elias’s fate reframe all prior “researching gaps” as self-erasive. A slight weakness is that the mechanism by which the Library “listens” and chooses the traveler over Elias is more hinted at than dramatized, though not enough to break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: swatch → hall of mirrors → ledger/name → swatch drinking ink → sister’s return → decision to turn to the others → entry into the garden as the ship sinks. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the Mirabilis dies as a locus of harm/containment while the sisters cross into a reconfigured space of ongoing responsibility. World mechanics around the garden and narrative threads are slightly impressionistic but coherent enough under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The single-scene structure with one temporal window feels tight and self-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discover impossible door → experiment with rope → access liminal library → realization and return, all under a consistent causal chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she decides not to archive but to live the unrecordable, reweighting the opening premise of an archivist confronting an impossible artifact. The cost is mostly conceptual—she foregoes her deepest professional impulse—but it is legible in her choice not to reach for the notebook. For elite publication, one more beat that tightens consequences (e.g., a clearer sense of what she risks losing by merging) would deepen the sense of irreversible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: reading the ice → conjuring the bloom of hush → the beings’ response and reconfiguration. Causality is intact and legible under a textural/causal hybrid lens, and the closure—storm shifting into lullaby and Eldrin’s purpose reframed into ongoing listening—lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration. The main weakness is that the cost of this change is more conceptual than dramatically pressured; nothing crucial threatens to fail on the page. Still, the before/after of the caves’ function and Eldrin’s role is precise and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: climb → attempt to rekindle → flare → realization → aftermath, with backstory interleaved but always anchored to present stimuli. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural drive, and the closure delivers a conceptual repricing (it was never about bringing the past back) with a felt emotional cost. Stakes are somewhat abstract—there’s little concrete consequence if the attempt fails beyond her continued loneliness—which keeps the narrative from fully tightening. Still, the final alignment of stars, beacon, and rain coheres as a satisfying before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, lyric pattern early and holds it: one continuous night in the forecourt culminating in a conceptual repricing of identity and memory. Causality is soft but coherent within the world’s rules (Spear’s shadow → offered memory → revaluation of her life’s method). Closure lands cleanly: she abandons the old drive to sculpt identity and returns inside under a new stance, with the blank page now sufficient. Stakes and cost are internal but legible, though there’s room for one more concrete, on-page consequence of the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival → discovery of mosaic → decision to ignite → fireworks → fortress/world response → reflective exit, with clear because/therefore links. Closure is strong and on-page: Liora’s act restores stars and reconfigures how the world “remembers” light, with a visible before/after. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than materially dramatized, but it’s legible in the reweighted world and her heavier inner state. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: a pause in conversation → grotto consultation → choice to give the cicada → later resonance with hermit crab and dream. Causality is subtle but coherent under a textural lens (her perception in the grotto informs her silent response and gift), and the orientation (who/where/when) is clear early. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s “transitions” are repriced through the final dream and damp sleeve, with grief and time reweighted. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than dramatic, but it is legible and present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly tiered around the three inversions, each building on the last, with the doll and trellis escalating from uncanny discovery to decisive escape tool. Causality holds: learning to sprout → exploring the trellis → acquiring the gilded hush → using it to unfold the bunker. Closure is strong—a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing when the child becomes “the door”—and the bunker’s collapse reads as a real, irrevocable turn. The only structural softness is the vaguely defined external threat (“They’re coming”), which slightly blurs concrete stakes at the moment of maximum decision.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: one continuous scene in which repeated acts (adjusting prisms, consulting the vial, receiving a passenger) build toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than a causal twist. Orientation is swift and clean, and every introduced element (storm glass, dial, prisms, train-whistle hush) is paid off in the final cadence. Closure lands as a clear RR: the terrace is “lighter now,” the vial clear, and Elias’s ongoing task reweighted by this particular encounter. The cost—bearing, redistributing, and not erasing sorrow—is legible, though intentionally quiet rather than dramatically spiked.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: orchard → flake → waterfall → murals → hatch → throne → unmaking, all under the “until sunrise” frame. The piece delivers solid closure via a decisive change and conceptual repricing: the throne is destroyed, the cycle of ascension ends, and the city’s relationship to power is reweighted. The single-scene structure with a return to the orchard creates a satisfying circularity without confusion. Time pressure is slightly under-leveraged (she never feels close to failing the sunrise deadline), but it doesn’t harm coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece runs as a single, coherent scene with clear anchors (who/where/what’s wrong) very early, and the accumulative drive toward the threshold decision is clean. We move from eerie textural signs, to a concrete apparition, to a clear binary: keep holding the dead or release them and leave. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: “Lior stepped through” into a new door and air, with the old sanctuary-and-ghost economy relinquished. The internal stakes are well tracked, though the practical consequences of crossing that new threshold remain intentionally abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible under a largely causal drive lens: find bolt → receive texts → choose to engage → twist bolt → conceptual unthreading → new diamond/repriced promise → refusal to re-enter the loop. Closure lands as a mix of Earned Stasis and Conceptual Repricing: Lina keeps the diamond but declines further participation, with the cost visible in blood, loss of the bolt, and a charged, ambiguous future. The loop/promise language converges coherently in “break it or become it” and her refusal to check the final buzz. A minor constraint is that the Eidolon’s fate and the larger world implications remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping the structure slightly more lyric than fully plotted.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: letters → experiment with crank → discovery of mirror → communication with reflection → realization that the room is the ledger → choice to write for the next soul. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration of his role and the dynasty’s “failure.” The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—thirty years of presumed failure reweighted in a few paragraphs—but it’s legible on the page. There are no orientation issues, and all set-ups (letters, equation, crank, ledger rumor) pay off, though escalation remains deliberately quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the program → activation of threads/“forgotten patterns” → command to *unsnap* → release of shadows and reconfiguration of the space into a stage → his spoken acknowledgment and acceptance of the role. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—breaking silence and entering the performance—while maintaining a coherent Hybrid (causal + accumulative) lens. Stakes and mechanics stay legible despite the lyric mode, though some elements (what exactly the “allegiance” extracts) remain abstract rather than concretely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: finding Daniel’s thin file → discovering the button → research → mailing the envelope → recommitting with Maria’s file. The structure—one day into evening, then the following morning—feels proportionate and easy to track. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias moves from passive custodian of forgotten stories to an active steward of connection. Stakes remain intimate, so the piece reads more as a precise miniature than a fully pressurized arc, but within that scope it’s well-structured.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hybrid causal/accumulative structure is clean: key → booth → intel about the last archive → off-page fire/theft → long-term ripple (Quiet Rebellion and the left-behind key). The shards (night at lagoon, diner next morning, historians-years-later) are legible and cohere under one drive lens focused on resisting erasure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: history’s narrative is reweighted around quiet acts, at an implied cost of Lena’s safety and anonymity. The main operational beat (the actual archive fire and ledger theft) is elided, which keeps this from a higher score because cost and escalation are partly off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → ritual attempt to hush the prophecy → apparent success → reveal of lingering prophecy → city echo → chosen return, all causally linked. The accumulative/textural lens holds well: each beat deepens the sense of inescapable, reciprocal obligation between him and the grotto. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he shifts from attempting erasure to accepting ongoing, costly stewardship. Stakes around what happens if the prophecy fully manifests remain abstract, so the cost is more metaphysical than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: discovery of the speck → key revelation → monuments awakening → ladder to the islands → sapling encounter → transformative jump → new grove. Causality is stable even in this lyric register, and the drive lens (accumulative with causal turns) stays coherent. Closure is strong: Liora’s irreversible transformation and the arbor’s disappearance constitute a clear before/after with conceptual cost. A touch more concrete resistance or complication around the mid-turn could elevate the sense of earned inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: clock → compass → greenhouse → waterfall/ledger → recombined tools → city’s regrowth, all under a single POV with one temporal glide (“Months later”). Causality under the textural lens holds: each discovery reframes the last and narrows his stance until he un-makes the clock and chooses improvisation as method. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—he abandons his defining repair impulse and lets the last gear go. Stakes remain primarily internal and the external city-regrowth consequence is sketched rather than pressured, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: search party departs → coin discovery → mystical response at crucible → choice to repeat Veyra’s method → memory vial → decision to transmute herself. Orientation is immediate (foundry in a storm, missing metallurgist, abandoned search), and the single-POV, two-location structure (foundry → workshop) is coherent. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: she adopts Veyra’s pursuit but reframed as self-alchemy. The only limitation is that external complications are minimal, so the sense of narrowing options is more conceptual than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: single continuous scene in Echo Gorge, causal enough but primarily accumulative as atmosphere and recognition build toward a reconfiguration of what “collecting” means. Setups (the tooth, the gorge’s warped echoes, the misaligned harp) all pay off in the final re-weighting, where the soul is integrated rather than sent on. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora leaves with a different understanding of her work and a new relation to the place, with felt emotional cost in the “ache” and lightened satchel. Stakes are modest and internal, but the before/after is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: waking → drawn by forest → shrine ritual/vision → re-emergence, with clear causal or at least mythically-motivated steps. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with a different relationship to his trauma and the “equation,” marked by the strap and his new attention to silence. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent; each beat deepens pressure and reweights mercy and pain. The convenience of the forest immediately providing a shrine is accepted in the piece’s quasi-mystical logic but does slightly soften causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: market → lens fragment → painting → Elara’s log → integration of lens → conceptual revaluation of anchors, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Causality is soft but legible under a textural lens, and closure lands with Lior’s new stance (“anchors weren’t for staying…they were for returning”) reweighting all prior beats. The cost is more conceptual than felt—taking on the burden of carried, unfinished stories—so the ending is resonant but not piercing. Structural moves are tidy and clean but slightly safe for elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight and causal: investigation of “cracks” leads to dust-reading, to the concealed door, to the mechanism, to the choice to dismantle, with no dead beats or teleports. Orientation is clear early—who, where, when—and the occult machinery is introduced through action rather than exposition. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change: he disables the mechanism, shattering the preserved laugh and altering the ghosts’ state, with a clear before/after. The only limit is that external opposition or complication is light, so pressure never fully tightens around his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: frost patterns signal that reality is “negotiable,” compelling Elias to deploy the forbidden bottled whisper via the press, which in turn triggers the library’s shuddering, alternate-library glimpses, and ultimately Elias’s self-recognition and surrender. Structure is tight and linear within a single scene, with one clear escalation (printing the page) and a decisive closure beat (choosing dissolution and release over continued containment). The closure unit works as both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: the library’s purpose is redefined (“never meant to float forever”) and Elias pays on-page cost by dissolving with it. Stakes and consequences land clearly despite the abstract, mythic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, causally linked from ritual preparation through temporal vision to the quiet denouement. The closure is a conceptual repricing—history vs poetry, excavation vs remembrance—with tangible cost (the shard destroyed, the vision unrecoverable, Elias remaining in chosen solitude). Stakes (the Republic’s legacy and the dispute with archaeologists) are set up early and resolved on-page through the demonstration. A slightly frictionless resolution—Taelis concedes quickly—keeps it just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: the music box arrives, the stone is revealed as cursed key, Elias chooses to engage, and the chamber/world transform with a clear price. Causality is tight—each escalation (“It was a key. / And the lock was Elias himself.”) follows from the previous beat rather than feeling arbitrary. The brief epilogue with the tinkers lands as a resonant coda rather than a reset, underlining the cost in absence. Closure is both decisive (Elias gone, city altered) and conceptually reweighted, with no orientation or lens slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine—compass → lagoon → arch → realization → renunciation—is clean, with no orientation or logic slips, and the story holds a single POV and scene window effectively. The closure beat is a resonant reconfiguration: he abandons the drive for explanation, pays the cost by destroying the notes, and redefines his vocation. The build through the lagoon encounter tightens options in a controlled way, and the arch scene is clearly the fulcrum. A touch more on-page uncertainty at the threshold (lingering on the possible consequences of going through) could raise the sense of decisive risk.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: lost in storm → experimentation with the slide → revelation of the arch as loom → contributing his carving → storm releases him. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure (a resonant reconfiguration of what the archway is) lands clearly. The price—surrendering the slide/GPS and accepting a more intuitive, communal navigation—is present though understated. There are no orientation or timeline confusions, and the single-scene flow is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: a season of work, growing focus on the glass and postcards, then the revelation and quiet departure. Causality is soft but coherent—her sustained attention, use of the postcards, and physical contact with the window lead naturally to the discovery of the pressed jasmine. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the reframing from “why flowers bloom at night” to “what silence reveals,” with a clear before/after in her stance. Stakes remain internal and modest, but within a lyric frame the arc is satisfyingly complete and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: letters → decoding/visions → lagoon descent → confrontation → decision to release → new ledger. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the structure (ship → shore → ship) is elegant and easy to track. Closure lands on Elias’s deliberate choice to relinquish the diary, with on-page cost in terms of vocation and the lost record. The only structural softness is how swiftly the Board withdraws, slightly undercutting the sense of risk before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present action of kneeling with the bottle, a compact flashback to the last wish, then a steady escalation of sensory manifestations culminating in the town’s revival. Causality is solid under a causal/accumulative hybrid lens: he focuses → the bottle warms/pulses → people and sensations cohere → he opens his eyes to a changed world and releases the tool. Closure is a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: from last survivor in a dead town to participant in a “second beginning,” with the cost of abandoning his isolated stasis. Nothing essential is left dangling at this scale, and the rules of the bottle are stable enough for the ending to land.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the shaving → ritual immersion → emergence of the prophecy → personal naming (“You are the hinge”) → decision about what/how to record. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is tight, with each step logically following from his vocation and methods. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Elias accepts his role as hinge, chooses a specific containment (beeswax, burial) rather than exploitation, and recommits to “listening” with new weight. The cost—bearing unshareable knowledge and responsibility—is implicit but legible in his shaken hands and careful refusal to write the prophecy itself.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: hatching → ritual with the cap → vortex awakening → reversing the pull via the seed → transformed chick and temporary quiet. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—the last heirloom seed is spent, the vortex is muted but not destroyed, and a new cap appears. The structure is a tight single scene with consistent drive, though the personal price beyond the sacrificed seed (e.g., what she loses emotionally or in future options) could be shaded more sharply to deepen the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: repaired rope → test → flaw detected → risky reweaving → successful second test → storm hits and validates his choice. The backstory about the previous tester’s rope-switch disaster meaningfully raises stakes and justifies Elias’s urgency. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the bell tolling “on its own” proves the system’s integrity, and his quiet waiting embodies earned stasis with the implied cost of ongoing vigilance. The structure is straightforward and single-scene; it could sustain higher tension with a sharper on-page complication, but nothing breaks causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: long-established stasis, meteor shower arrival, the encounter with the lingering star, its transformative contact, and Eli’s departure form a coherent arc. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is sound—the event arrives as cosmic “grace,” but each turn (refusing protocols, letting the light in, then leaving) is a because/therefore progression in Eli’s stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Eli’s role shifts from overlooked janitor to conscious witness, with the universe now visibly “responding.” The cost—abandoning the station and his hermit-like safety—is legible but somewhat idealized, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is tight: ruined oasis → arrival of ghosts → pressure on the box → opening → comb revelation → time-jump payoff with renewed oasis. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (covenant untangling into open air; wasteland blooming) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a legible cost (his life spent in silence, followed by his absence). The epilogue with travelers and bees remembering cleanly reframes the opening condition without overexplaining. A slight sense of inevitability/predictability around “last promise leads to renewal” keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clear and linear: urn → silo → climb → messages → time capsule → realization → commitment, with no orientation issues. The accumulative/textural drive (discovering layered artifacts and notes) coheres, and closure lands via a conceptual repricing of what timekeeping means. Causality is mostly solid, though the garage-sale urn leading so cleanly to a perfectly tailored silo of secrets feels slightly convenient. The ending’s cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps this strong but short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative lyric: each object/event (feather, boat, kite snap, retrieval) layers toward the final repricing of incompletion. Causality is modest but coherent: the snapped kite introduces a new beat that leads to the string around his wrist and the closing image of frayed connections. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive outward change, and the before/after in his stance is legible with a conceptual cost (abandoning perfectionism). Orientation is crystal-clear throughout, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present action in the orchard, one nightfall/dawn transition, and a clear before/after hinged on Elira’s death and Tomas taking up her work. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: prognosis → refusal of passive death → heretical remodeling of the orchard → Tomas’s exposure to it → his adoption of her methods. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mantle passes, the orchard’s new configuration and Tomas’s copper-wrapped wrist embody continuance with cost (her death). There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are anchored early and remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: loss of institutional backing → following the anomalous signal-path → tower interior trial of questions → choice to accept the pilgrimage → coda that reweights the initial premises. The hybrid lens (causal plus conceptual repricing) holds through to the end, and the closure—her departure with visible cost—is on the page. The brief University coda reinforces closure rather than reopening plot, but the life she leaves behind is mostly summarized instead of tested in-scene. Overall structure is elegant and tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—twilight seeding on the jetty, planning at Gloom Hill, then forward-leap to the long-term outcome—reads cleanly and coheres under a textural/accumulative drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the battlefield is recontextualized as a garden whose memory supplants war’s, with a clear before/after axis. Causality is soft but coherent: his years of seeding plausibly lead to the later fishermen lore. The main limit is that pressure and choice never feel truly constraining, so the closure’s cost is more conceptual than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Rook finds the cylinder, listens, receives a map-like riddle, follows it through the wasteland, discovers the dome, and chooses to enter, with that act reconfiguring the world’s message network. The hybrid drive (causal plus lyric/accumulative) stays coherent to the end, and closure is strong: his transition from hunter of bodies to rooted messenger carries clear cost (his old life, likely his life itself) and reweights the premise. The world’s “rules” around the leaf, garden, and script are slightly hand-wavy but consistent enough within a fable frame. Nothing crucial feels telegraphed late or patched retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single continuous scene with one dominant throughline: anomaly appears → Lira interprets via family custom → she chooses to leap. Causality is solid even in a lyric mode; each beat emerges logically from the prior (seeing the light prompts sketching, aligning the sketch reorients the compass, which enables the leap). Closure is a mix of decisive change and conceptual repricing: “Home” becomes direction rather than place, and she literally departs along that vector. The main structural limitation is that the material cost of her choice (what she’s abandoning or risking) remains mostly conceptual, not concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: climb spire → infiltrate chamber → execute swap → confrontation with Keeper → emotional turn → lid recovered → sky begins to mend. Closure is solid under a causal/accumulative lens: her choice to “amend” rather than merely steal reconfigures the Keeper, the sky, and her path forward. The cost is mainly conceptual/emotional (risk, vulnerability, letting the Keeper see his name) rather than dramatized through painful sacrifice, which keeps this just shy of exceptional. Structure holds as a single, continuous scene with no orientation issues and a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is tight: gallery → chessboard revelation → penumbra’s lunge → wings/silence repricing the conflict, all under one continuous scene. Causality is metaphorical but coherent: her dust-words and engagement with the board provoke a reconfiguration that the penumbra cannot consume, which directly shapes its retreat. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing—shifting from “stories vs oblivion” to “gaps/silence vs consumption”—with a visible cost in her stepping into “luminous absence” and relinquishing the old frame. One could argue for a slightly clearer hinge where her realization about “spaces between” becomes tactical rather than purely poetic, but the drive lens (accumulative/textural with situational pressure) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean and legible: search → discovery of the stone → revelation that it’s a mirror → seeding page → door → acceptance of role, all causally linked. The closure (a resonant reconfiguration where his relationship to memory and talent is rewritten) is on the page and conceptually costly. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal plus accumulative lyric pattern), and it holds to the end. What keeps this from the very top tier is that the inciting urgency for *why now* and what specifically he risks by failing or succeeding remain a bit soft and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: tapestry → memory confrontation → labyrinth contact → village reanimation → game by the hearth. Closure is a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: he moves from exile and avoidance to presence and engagement, with the on-page cost of relinquishing his old mastery and accepting loss. There are no orientation issues; the time-frozen village and later inn are clear as one continuous window of action. The only slight limitation is that external stakes remain small-scale and interior, though they are fully coherent with the design.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: past mischief → knowledge of the spire’s true function → plan to carve at the fissure just before the ritual → disruption and shattering. Time, space, and stakes are all anchored early (“before the ritual,” “fissure in the third tower”), and the closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing of absolution. Cost is primarily conceptual/social (the collapse of the absolution system, unleashed confessions) with only modest immediate personal jeopardy dramatized for Liora. Structure is taut and single-scene, with no orientation or lens slips.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single escalating scene from key application through awakening to transcendence, with a clear causal chain (keys → statue stir → narration/choice → key turn → lift). Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the alchemist abandons their life’s pattern of patching from the margins and is literally removed from their crumbling world. The acid sea and collapsing workshop provide a consistent ticking-clock frame that tightens as we go. The only small reservation is that world-scale consequences remain more implied than dramatized, so the “soul of the world” premise never quite manifests beyond the statue.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: mirror shatters → caves become dangerous → mother’s cryptic instruction + shell → Elias’s wrong turn → discovery of pool → fulfillment of promise → renunciation of old life. The structure is mostly lyric-accumulative but still tracks causally toward closure, with the burning of the quay paintings as a decisive mid-beat turn that prepares the final jump. Closure is strong: the final leap into the cave’s mouth marks a clear before/after with cost. The only limitation is that the external “rules” of the mirror/cave temporality stay slightly hazy, leaning on mood more than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: listening → experimental beckoning → fishermen’s response → Harkin confrontation → quiet reconfiguration at dawn and night. Causality is soft but coherent (Elias’s scented “whisper” precedes and seems to cause the boats’ turn and Harkin’s transformation), and the pattern of vibrations/intent is held consistently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lighthouse’s function, Elias’s dependence on the cork, and Harkin’s worldview all shift. Stakes remain intimate rather than acute, but the before/after is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one night in the signal station with a brief, well-anchored flashback that reorients her current role. Causality is accumulative rather than plot-twist driven, but the pattern of lunar calls → mapping → initiating a call herself at the end constitutes a coherent escalation and closure. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from passive receiver of the lost to an active guide, with the before/after legible. The cost—continuing to live in this liminal role and the emotional toll of bearing others’ grief—is implied but could be made slightly more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → scarce truffles → pressure from warlord’s men + prior archivist encounter → tactical occlusion → burial of the eye as decisive change. The structure is essentially one continuous scene with interleaved backstory that clearly feeds present choices, and the drive lens (primarily causal with situational pressure) holds. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Renunciation: he gives up the eye’s potential and commits to burying truth, with clear conceptual cost. The off-page encounter with the men is slightly elided, but not enough to damage coherence or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: stranger arrives → Elias investigates through absences → ritual with the flower → conceptual decision to carry and release the memory. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each detail tightens the pattern toward the final repricing of what it means to be a “keeper of forgotten things.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias reframes lighthouse-keeping as a custodial role for borrowed memories, with a felt cost of continued isolation. Escalation is modest and largely internal, which keeps this just below the very top band but still publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: chip → cavern → ants/fissure → mythic door → bifurcated path → house and woman. The doorway of decisions gives a clear, legible before/after: he abandons the map-shop stasis for the overdue reckoning with the child’s sob. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration, with the creek’s crash marking the cost of no return. A touch more on-page friction at the split path (or a concrete sense of what he sacrifices in leaving The Hush) would push the structure into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is clean early: we know who she is, where she’s going, why, and what’s been warned. The structure is a tight causal line (dreams → climb → warning rejected → grotto memories → payment) with a decisive on-page change and visible cost. Closure is strong: she abandons her throne and becomes something else while the priests and kingdom inherit the fear and consequences. The only reason it’s not higher is that the outcome feels almost foreordained, with limited sense that any other path was truly live at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the ember nexus, anchored early, moving from expectation (meeting with shell) through realization (shell as key) to enactment (transfer, jump). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the shell’s revaluation leads to changed behavior (giving it to Liora, jumping “through” the moment). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of alchemy and presence with on-page embodiment in the jump and the shell’s light in their boots/coats. Cost is somewhat abstract—Elias’s old approach is relinquished, but no concrete sacrifice or new constraint is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight: cabin → confrontation with younger self → burning of the scroll → grave reveal → reweighted final image. Causality holds cleanly under a largely accumulative/textural lens: the arrival of the younger Elias and the mutable scroll force a decision that leads directly to the burning and the emptied grave. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing—the destruction of narrative records alters his relationship to time and self with on-page cost (the scream, the loss of the chronicle). Nonlinearity is thematic rather than confusing; the pattern is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene that layers fog, tools, memory, and the visitor’s need into a conceptual turn at the end. Causality is modest but coherent: the woman’s arrival and request trigger Elias’s interpretive work, which in turn reframes his relationship to time and his own loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—time and absence become something to be *read* rather than fixed—with a legible emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure from the opening and there are no unkept set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly a single continuous scene with one dominant throughline: perform the rune-work in the lull and reconfigure her scars before the storm returns. Causality is coherent and accumulative—each move (inscribing the rock, the rune fracturing, the quill shedding) pushes her toward the decisive act of touching the oldest scar and speaking the rune’s name. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits the platform literally descended and reoriented toward future storms, with visible cost in relinquishing her old fear-identity. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities to undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single escalating encounter, with clear causal beats: Mara arrives → offers the perfume’s current → Elias chooses to engage → the magic extends to the orchard → they commit to planting anew. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard is lost but transmuted into memory and saplings, and their relationship is reoriented from estrangement to shared labor. The cost is on the page—the bulldozers still come, and the magic cannot “fix” that—so the miracle’s limits are structurally meaningful. For an elite level, one more concrete obstacle or complicating choice between competing goods would tighten the dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is coherent and satisfying: dictionary → shifting definitions → revelation that the library is a dying being → spiral arbitration as last act → decisive tearing of the dictionary → rebirth and release. The drive feels Hybrid with a strong causal spine; each action with the dictionary escalates or clarifies the situation. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: he ends the arbitration and history-as-witness, accepting a new mode of being. Cost is legible in the collapse of the library and loss of written history, even if the emotional price is handled with lyric distance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: winding/listening leads to anomaly, which escalates as he continues the ritual, culminating in a concrete choice to release the key. The story maintains a single, coherent scene with no orientation debt, and the closure—his refusal and conceptual reframing of clocks—lands on the page with a legible before/after. The Bureau/father backstory is woven in efficiently to charge the central decision rather than detouring the structure. A slightly more explicit sense of what would happen if he pulled the ship fully through could heighten the felt cost even further.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure—a single overnight visit that accumulates observations until the decisive act of adding her own pulse—is clean and legible, with no orientation issues. The causal chain (old expertise + grief → interest in “conversations” → mapping attempt → joining the network → redefined mission) holds under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is strong: leaving the scanner and walking toward “places where people mistook silence for absence” is a clear resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. The stakes stay intimate rather than sharply tested, which slightly limits the sense of structural compression at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is coherent: subway scrawls → library/lantern → initial test (blue path) → reconfiguration → final leap into contradiction. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: Lila shifts from her father’s notion of “responsible” to embracing risk as the new responsible stance, with the implied cost of stepping away from his worldview and bedside. The accumulative, slightly surreal logic is consistent under a hybrid causal/textural lens, and the final image tightens rather than diffuses. Stakes remain a bit abstract—what concretely happens when she steps through is left open—but the before/after in her stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: a single scene that layers calls, backstory examples, and the current conversation into a clear pattern. Causality is modest but coherent—his role and tool (glass harmonica) shape what happens and lead to a quiet yet definite closure beat when he sets the next call and hangs up first. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he recommits to this liminal job with an implied cost of ongoing isolation. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, but there is no structural confusion or unkept setup.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric rather than tightly causal, but the structure is coherent: she arrives, performs a ritualized act, crystallizes a stance, and departs. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend: she accepts the covenant’s incomplete state yet commits to continuing the work, with a felt emotional cost. Stakes remain somewhat abstract—no immediate on-page threat to the covenant beyond time and forgetting—so escalation is more tonal than situational. Still, the bell marking “the hour when the old world blurred into the new” gives a clear before/after hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clear: arrive → seed usefulness/rumor → meet Mira → discover Carter’s true work → reframe the “cure” → choose to pass on the rock and leave. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the cure for loneliness becomes a distributed act of belief and exchange rather than a pharmaceutical MacGuffin, and we see an on-page before/after in Lena’s stance (“for once, she wasn’t the only one keeping score”). The drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative and stays coherent, with no orientation or time confusion. The main limitation is that obstacles are mild, so structural turns feel smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative arc: years of dowsing → entering forest during the celestial pause → following sonic trails → arriving at the stillpoint → leaving transformed. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure (grief “mapped,” stillpoint internalized) lands firmly with a clear before/after. Orientation is excellent from the opening line; who/where/when and the governing rules are legible very early. The only limitation is that the on-page journey feels more like a ritual enactment than a pressured choice under escalating constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: anomaly → pen activation → prewritten line → conceptual reframe → decision to act, all causally or texturally linked. Orientation is strong from the outset (observatory, anomaly, role), and the gravitational anomaly plus pen form a coherent engine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the move from “fix the past” to “layer and replant” is explicit and on-page. The main limitation is that the cost and stakes of this reconfiguration remain largely conceptual rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: quiet opening pattern (mapping silence) → disturbance (shadow, dimming glow) → confrontation with the faceless singer → resolution that reconfigures the harbor and the camera. Causality is solid under a mostly causal with accumulative-textural lens: the act of remembering/summoning draws the thing that feeds on forgetting, and the tactics they choose (signing as net, camera as disruptor) resolve it. Closure lands with a clear before/after—the harbor’s silence gains new meaning, and the camera acquires “weight” as a repository of names. The only slight softness is how conveniently the entity appears exactly now, but it doesn’t disrupt logic or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: tapestry → third pillar → key → ledger → decision to burn, all anchored in one continuous descent through the archive. The closure is a decisive act with real cost—destroying the ledger and archive to uphold his reframed motive of saving the world from the promise. Backstory is interleaved economically and always pivots the present (“He’d burned the libraries to rescue the promise…”). The only ceiling here is that the external situation never complicates much beyond his internal revelation, so structural pressure stays relatively simple.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense scene at the lagoon, interleaved with concise context about the treatment, building to her decision to release the memories. Causality holds: the garden’s properties + her history of sabotage → realization of a new tactic → execution and consequence (memories leaving, mind cleared). Closure is on the page with cost—the loss of others’ memories, break with the treatment, and a new but fragile stasis. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, with no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single primary encounter (challenge → attempt → “exit”) plus a brief coda, with clear causal steps from storm to map to coin to door-like slit. The drive lens reads as a Hybrid leaning Situational/Accumulative: external circumstances (storm, shifting labyrinth) force a stance crystallization about quiet endurance. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Lior has “left” and yet remains, reframing what escape and listening mean. The one soft spot is that the difficulty of the navigation feels relatively untested, which slightly blunts the sense of structural cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: the guardian’s light-weaving with the mirror gradually reconfigures the boy’s emotional state, then quietly ripples into the father. Causality is clean and modest—no big reversals, but a coherent chain from boy’s arrival in distress → silent ritual → boy’s decision to leave the note → father’s reaction next morning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silence between father and son is reweighted from estrangement toward “listening,” at a clear emotional cost that has been carried from the start. Structure (one main scene plus a brief following-morning shard) feels tight and justified.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: threat → preparation (grotto and students) → townwide displays → noon confrontation → conceptual aftermath. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: his choices with the grotto and filings lead directly to the magnetic defense and the workers’ withdrawal, which enables the council’s notice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—“now they see the board” reweights the rebellion and the town’s behavior—with a clear before/after around the library’s status. The main limitation is that the pivotal reversal (council backing down) happens off-page, softening the sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: island’s decay and history → whale’s call → scrimshaw’s response → physical transformation → return of the key → island’s dissolution and conceptual reveal (“Veyth had never been an island. It was a cage”). Closure lands solidly as a decisive change with a conceptual repricing of the entire setting, and Elias’s choice to dive and not look back provides a legible before/after. The story stays in one continuous scene with no orientation issues, and all major elements pay off. The main limitation is that the “cost” of the choice is gestured at more than dramatized, making the structural turn feel slightly cleaner than it is emotionally heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from static numbness to a triggered confrontation with it (the tin), to the scream, to a reconfigured hush and shared craft. Each beat grows logically from the last (tin → memory of falsified happiness → scream → burning tin / teaching whittling). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush becomes chosen, not enforced, and Lena’s stance toward grief visibly shifts. The cost—abandoning the safety of emotional paralysis—is legible in the rawness of the scream and the small, risky offer to Harkin.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrival after the ban, deepening attunement to the quartz, the lake responding, and the approaching poets all build toward a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is coherent under the world’s quasi-mystical rules—her engagement with the colonnade leads to the lake’s cracking and thaw, and to the atrium’s transformation. Closure lands as a resonant repricing of “certainty” and “sacred boundaries,” with a legible before/after for both Elira and the world. The main limitation is that the cost of this shift is hinted (elders’ fear, world changing) rather than sharpened into a concrete loss or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clean: courtyard → phoenix’s passing → day’s small exchanges → night’s shared music, with no orientation debt. Causality is soft but coherent—Elias’s night of practice, Liora’s basil, the message-bed of plants, and the old woman’s barter all converge on the closing “stay/again” sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias moves from solitary, imperfect seeing to shared, embodied awakening with Liora, with his old stance of fearing the post-phoenix silence implicitly foreclosed. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized as a sharp turn, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure—one main scene plus a brief “next morning” coda—reads cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens, with each acoustic development (hum → voice-like sound → path → new bell) deepening the central premise. Causality is coherent: the restored grid enables the experiment, the lens introduces distortion, and the resulting anomaly reconfigures Liora’s understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she shifts from seeking sound “out there” to recognizing herself as the connective space. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatic, which keeps the stakes somewhat muted but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: crane → coordinates → box/flower → new art practice → communal ritual → handing a crane to a stranger. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Lena’s stance toward grief and solitude is visibly altered, with the observatory transformed from mausoleum to workshop for shared mourning. Stakes remain intimate and there’s no major reversal, but the escalation and before/after are legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-moment work → client arrives with problem → collaborative reading → reoriented mission at the end. Causality is clear at this scale (she brings the chains; that prompts the mapped spread; the confession prompts the "measure the space between what he promised and what they heard" insight). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias shifts from private post-mortem to an explicit project of mapping culture before the "next oracle"—a conceptual repricing of his work. The main limitation is that the decentering of personal stakes makes the before/after more intellectual than dramatically costly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the archive, engagement with the pagoda, escalating activation, and a release that seals the place and reconfigures her stance on knowledge. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each beat intensifies atmosphere and risk until the pagoda’s dissolution and the archive’s vanishing. Closure is solidly on-page—a clear before/after in her relationship to knowing, with the cost visible in letting the record dissolve and losing both the veil’s power and the archive. A slight reliance on expository explanation of the civilization’s fall, rather than dramatized pressure, keeps this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the stone → investigation through archives → conceptual reveal about unbound hope → decision and ritual-like exchange. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new piece of information reweighting the situation rather than offering twists. Closure is solidly a resonant reconfiguration: Liora’s status relative to hope and the library is clearly “before/after,” with a legible price (partial loss of her shadow/self). There are no orientation issues, and the world rules around shadows/emotions remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Lumen’s injury triggers memory of the con, which drives concrete reparative acts, which in turn reframe both the tail’s regrowth and Elias’s choice to go out into the world again. The “shedding layers” structure gives a clear middle escalation from workshop → market → letters. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: he steps forward with a new, costly stance rather than a reset. The cost—lifelong, unguaranteed effort without absolution—is legible in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece reads as a tight, accumulative single-scene structure with one coherent drive: Liora moving from pathological interpretation toward acceptance of not-knowing. Causality is mostly emotional/associative rather than event-driven but holds: surgery → plant voices → archive → mother’s file → revaluation of scars. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when she reframes wounds as memory-bearing rather than problems to solve and chooses endurance over further probing. The only limitation is that the “you were always the thing in the walls” beat feels more metaphysical than structurally necessary, slightly blurring stakes rather than tightening them.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a single, coherent accumulative scene in the booth, with clear causal layering: touch → vision → realization letters are in the reels → replay → goodbye. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she reweights what “unused love” means and forecloses continued searching. Cost is on-page in the final act of turning off the projector, accepting the end of the reel as the end of this attachment. All anchors (who/where/when and the rules of her gift) are clear and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a portal entry, descent into the well’s mystery, an unleashing climax, and a brief aftermath that recontextualizes events. Causality is legible under an accumulative/lyric lens—each cosmological image (archway, well, falling stars) unfolds into the next and culminates in the release of trapped creativity and Liora’s transformation. Closure is solid: we have a before/after (blocked vs. unblocked creativity, whispers vs. quiet) with a conceptual repricing in “You were always the key.” The main limitation is that the stakes and risks implied early (urgency before the light fades) never quite sharpen into a moment where failure or harm feels concretely possible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: crate → clock → spark → decision to re-crate and rewind → altered world/track, and the closure (new tracks, green sand, Hollow remembering) is legible with a clear before/after. The structure is essentially linear with lyric flourishes and one temporal-feeling loop, which the narrative teaches and then resolves without disorientation debt. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized—world has “already reset too many times,” and this run must matter—but the piece stops just shy of testing that cost in a concrete dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: arrival with a goal, method (listening to trees), visionary frontier, revaluation of the hum, and a quiet but legible closure when he leaves the gear and ceases wandering. Causality and patterning hold: pressing the gear leads to the clearing; the hum’s pull creates the key turn; realization about becoming the hum reconfigures the initial quest. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “frontier” and “edge of the world,” with a before/after clearly implied. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: finding the punch → walking the ridgeway → conversation by the fire → solitary gesture at the water → acceptance into the vigil. Causality is intact and legible under a textural/situational lens, with each beat tightening her stance on staying versus crossing. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment when she releases the punch and accepts a new role, with the cost (abandoning her old duty/identity) felt on the page. The arc is quiet but coherent and scaled appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: bolt discovery → trail up the staircase → breach of the forbidden floor → confrontation and choice, with each step causally linked. The Global Drive Lens reads as Hybrid (primarily causal with strong textural accumulation around sound/silence), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s decision redefines “safety” and the fortress physically answers. Stakes and rules around the “unpardonable silence” are sketched efficiently through backstory that directly informs the present choice. Nothing crucial teleports or resets, and the cost of the final act is legible in the fortress’s groan and the implications for the guests below.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: cryptic warnings → recognition of the rune → the costful choice to sunder the scepter → the pretender’s unmasking and the world’s reset. The library’s time-folding and the rune of drift are integrated into this structure rather than left as ornament, and the closure (ending the lie and the kingdom’s suspended state) is clear with conceptual cost. Some major beats (Veythas seeking and confronting the pretender) are summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts immediacy and pressure near the climax. Nonetheless, the story achieves a solid Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration within its scope.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: years of watching → collecting fragments → rhythmic tapping → sonar anomaly → exposed road → choice to step onto it. Reflection is well anchored in present stimuli (gauges, atlas, grandmother’s memory) and consistently tilts the current stakes rather than stalling them. Closure lands as a charged poise/decisive act: Lena foregoes reporting and safety to follow the resurfaced path, with implied cost to life, career, and world-knowledge. A slightly sharper articulation of what she’s leaving behind (beyond one line from Voss) could heighten the sense of irreversible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: boredom and doubt → hum from stones → contact → activation → others drawn → engines reignite. The piece lands a clear closure beat with the first ship lifting off and the rebellion reconfigured from memory back into action. However, the large-scale turn from total lull to full bay “alive” feels almost too effortless, with little on-page resistance or cost modulating the arc. Structure as a single continuous scene is tight and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → message → pendant reinterpreted → ritual at springs → unsealing → community response. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo becomes a vine that literally and socially rewrites Reconstruction. Cost is present but soft—the threat of heresy and implied punishment never quite bites. Overall structure is tight for the length with no orientation issues and a single coherent drive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece follows a tight single-scene structure with a clear before/after: Lena arrives to freeze herself in grief and leaves having reweighted her attachment. Causality and accumulative texture work together: the tour group’s presence, the child’s misreading of the photograph, and the therapist’s method all funnel toward her decision to let the photo go and keep the leaf. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses pruning deadwood and “something like roots” over permanent suspension—without any causality breaks. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: lighthouse as lie → tarot shatter → redesign as map → dark opens → she steps into it, with no causal breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: darkness becomes presence and wholeness is recast as fragmentation accepted. The pressure of walls and failing beam provides a steady narrowing of options even without physical escape attempts. Cost is on-page in the renunciation of her prior role and acceptance of being “held” and then swallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: investigation → encounter → deployment of the ink pattern → reconfiguration of what the thief is doing → decision to pursue into the unknown. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (time is fractured, not stolen) plus a charged-poise ending (Kael steps through with a new stance and clear cost implied). The mechanics of how Kael infers the full truth from a fading symbol are a bit telescoped and could use one more concrete bridge. Still, structure is tight for the length and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: letter → revelation → agonized hesitation → decision to use dormant networks → alarms and Overseer confrontation → execution and aftermath. Closure is strong and costly—her death and the archives “speaking back” constitute a decisive change with clear before/after. Some world-logic gaps (who sent the letter, why now) are elided, but at this length they register as manageable mysteries rather than structural holes.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: a single continuous scene under a dome, oriented quickly to Liora, the roses, and the fallen tower outside. Pressure builds texturally—the fissured glass, the howling wind, the impending desert “ash”—toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure where she commits to stay and tend. Causality is modest but coherent: the sandbag crack, her response with the scrap and knife, her final listening to the roots. The cost and before/after are more conceptual than dramatic, which limits how hard the closure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: disturbed garden and constellations → invocation via silence → revelation of something wearing his daughter’s voice → confrontation and partial banishment → earned quiet coda on the dock. The piece operates on a mostly accumulative/lyric lens but maintains legible because/therefore links, and the closure is an Earned Stasis: he chooses lasting silence over renewed pursuit, with cost. No orientation debt; the shift from garden to dock is clear and thematically continuous. A minor escalation gap exists between the cosmic stakes of “patterns break themselves” and the very local-feeling mouth-in-the-dirt confrontation, but the emotional closure still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the journalist’s call primes the dilemma, the ledger search escalates it, and the arrival of the plates forces the decisive turn. The structure stays within one continuous window and lands an on-page decisive change with clear before/after stakes (“The orbit breaks here.”). The main weakness is the convenient timing of the man with the ’98 plates, which edges toward deus ex rather than earned complication. Still, closure is solid and legible under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight: letters → attempt to use the machine’s supposed rule → reversal (it feeds, not silences) → time fold → changed action in the crib. Causality is clean and each beat follows from prior information, with the clock and letters paying off well. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses the path of erasure and commits to witness. The only limitation is that the machine’s ontology remains a bit abstract, keeping the piece just shy of maximal structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: grotto → flake whisper → mandala opening → command to interject → village mural → return to grotto, with each step deepening the premise. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Lior shifts from private resistance to an ongoing, invited collaboration with the hush, reframing “unlearning” as “remembering.” Causality is clear and satisfying, but the cost of his choice to align against the elders remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete consequence. That keeps the piece just shy of the highest band in terms of structural and closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene where naming the dead via tesserae builds to a confrontation and then a reconfiguration of the plaza’s meaning. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each renaming tightens pressure until it cracks the commander. Closure lands clearly with the commander kneeling, the sword falling, and the stones glowing, with a legible before/after in moral stance. The only limit is that the commander’s turn is a bit swift, so the felt cost of that decisive change could be more developed.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous, legible scene in the maze-orchard with a clear before/after—Elias intending to die, then choosing to live. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/lyric lens: the maze opens, Lydia follows the “rule,” uses coin/orchard magic to show futures, which shifts Elias’s choice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change when he pockets the pills and the path seals, with a conceptual cost (Lydia’s ongoing half-life of anonymous encores) clearly implied. World rules (maze offers paths, orchard obeys) are consistent enough that the mild magical convenience reads as design, not plot hack.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story holds cleanly as a single, present-tense scene threaded with backstory that always tilts the current choice (e.g., the recall news and Mira’s breakdowns reweight the risk of using the sliver). Causality is solid: mysterious package → use of sliver → somatic “instructions” → lattice of connections → door and decision to go after Mira. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Decisive Change hybrid when Lena physically reaches into the door’s light, with clear before/after in worldview and trajectory. The only limitation is that the concrete cost of stepping through remains mostly conceptual, not dramatized in-body at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: approach → anomaly (levitating fossil) → deeper chamber → communication → re-emergence into rain, with each step intensifying the premise. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which Lior recognizes and assumes the role of voice for a sentient, remembering world; the before/after is legible. Causality is coherent—nothing teleports or contradicts prior rules—and the fossil’s escalating behavior tracks with their deepening connection. The main limitation is the relatively abstract cost: defying the councils and the implied burden of this role are gestured at but not concretely pressured or priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: prophecy fragment → search for jar → clue about the ninth button → retrieval at the well → pattern snap and hourglass reversal, all under a single coherent drive. Orientation (who/where/when) is precise from the first paragraph, and the structure (warehouse → canyon/well → warehouse/echoed) is elegant and legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the prophecy is reinterpreted as choice rather than doom, with visible consequences in the hourglass turning itself and time reversing. The main structural limitation is that the “treacherous” journey to the well is narrated as risky but plays out with minimal on-page resistance, softening the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal line is clean: mysterious snow-code → meeting at Zephyr Bluff → demand to open pillbox → revelation of key/coordinates → decision to “finish it.” Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure is on-page and earned: Lena forecloses the option of self-exile and accepts re-entry into danger, with her scars and past failure clearly implicated as the cost. The war and “network” remain offstage but feel coherent enough not to undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    Structure is simple and effective: wait at the foggy crossing under a rule, perceive the signal, cross, then hand off the mantle. The causal spine (prophecy → listening to fog/gutters → “Now” → gutters stop halfway across → baton-pass to the girl) is legible and clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the promise and its implements move from traveler to coachman to girl, with the coachman continuing the cycle. The cost is conceptually present (lifelong duty for him, separation for the girl and mother) but only lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clear: smoke → return to oasis → encounter with bee/glass → incorporation into the bowl → kiln → realization/renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—“resistance wasn’t refusal. It was remembrance.”—with the cost marked by leaving the bowl behind. Causality is soft but coherent; each step feels like a natural, motivated deepening rather than an outliney “and then.” Stakes remain largely conceptual/emotional, but the before/after state is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: rose petal falls → wilted basil and blood → Elias’s arrival and shared gauge → internal reconfiguration toward hope. Causality is emotional rather than plot-driven but coherent, with each image and interaction tightening the central question of whether she will risk opening up again. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the state of the rosebush and door metaphor are clearly “before/after” markers with a felt cost of vulnerability. Nothing crucial feels teleported or retrofitted; the piece respects its own small scale.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: hum → translator’s hour → mirrored book → realization → doors opening. Causality is steady and legible under a textural lens: the bird’s attack on the sundial triggers the shockwave, the book, and Lior’s understanding, which in turn enables him to release the bird and leave. Closure is strong: the doors opening and the clock chiming, after ages of stasis, constitute a clear before/after with conceptual and emotional cost. Nothing crucial teleports or resolves by coincidence, and the mystical logic holds within its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the temple → contributing the client’s spiral → contributing her own → walking out to write anew, with the dream as a resonant coda rather than a reset. Causality is clear under a textural lens: each small act of relinquishing reweights her stance toward secrets. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reconceives her work and begins writing from a new motive. The only limit is that the dream reprise slightly diffuses, rather than tightens, the sense of cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: a changed signal, Liora’s decision to interfere, the campus’s palpable reaction, and the signal’s shift from predatory to curious. Orientation is solid from the outset, and the story sustains a single coherent scene with no temporal confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship between humans and the signal, and between Liora and her institution, has shifted from helplessness to wary dialogue. The cost—risk of professional and perhaps existential fallout—is implied rather than sharply articulated, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: compass → opening slab → descent → key → spatial revolt → test → decisive act → city reconfigured. The piece maintains a single coherent drive under a causal lens and lands an on-page decisive change with conceptual cost (rewriting the city; accepting rebellion over mere prudence). Structure is tight for the length, with no confusing jumps or unkept setups. If anything, the resolution feels slightly easy—no genuine possibility of failure or loss lingers once he commits to driving the key into the table.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: ribbon → quarry descent → ritual with the lance → vision of Liora’s erasure → exit with new internal stance. Causality is tight under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens; each move grows naturally from the previous without teleports or retroactive fixes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot reopen the case, but the world is reweighted by his commitment to witness and the secret he now carries. Stakes remain personal and conceptual rather than dramatically tested, which keeps this strong but not towering.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → unearthed box → journal/nail → theory of the Maw → defiance of orders → catastrophic near-opening → renunciation. The piece holds a clear Causal lens with a strong closure beat (burning the journal and reinterpreting Orin), and cost is legible in the lost knowledge and risk. The single scene with brief backfill is structurally tight and easy to orient in. The Maw’s disappearance and the partial glimpse of the other side land as a satisfying, charged ellipsis rather than a plot hole.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: hitchhiker vanishes → glass left behind → Elias engages with it → hidden road appears → he steps through. Structure is linear and clean, with one core escalation from observation to irrevocable crossing. Closure is a decisive change (entering a new reality and becoming the song) with an implied but real before/after. The cost is mostly conceptual and opportunity-based rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece uses a single continuous visit to the train, braided with reflection, under an accumulative/textural lens, and it orients who/where/when quickly and cleanly. Causality is modest but coherent: past heist → startup boom/bust → Elias’s career dissuading greed → return to the last heist site seeking meaning. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he reframes his life’s “circling” and chooses to leave something behind. The main structural limitation is the relative lack of a distinct mid-story tightening; the pressure deepens smoothly rather than turning sharply, which keeps this short of top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: observatory → telegram/sister → temple-as-light → revelation that the temple is a loom → redefinition of his role, all linked by the telescope and ledger. Causality is soft but coherent; each new image (variable stars, living ruins, thread into his chest) clearly deepens the same drive instead of branching. Closure is solidly a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s rule (burdens woven into the sky) is reweighted with conceptual cost and a new stance. The near-total interiority works at this length, though one sharper on-page test of his old pattern (e.g., a concrete refusal to share) would further tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: warlock’s failed trick → stolen seed → ritual at the lake → manifestation → revelation → key and renunciation. Backstory (war, brother’s “drowning,” warlock’s intent) is interleaved without stalling the present scene and directly reweights the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Eldrin’s understanding of the lake and his brother changes, and he pays a visible cost by choosing endurance/silence over further confrontation. The structure is linear and tight, if somewhat reliant on a single magical intervention to expose all hidden truths.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: scars → maze clipping → vision → maze navigation → encounter with future self → covenant reframed → return with silver leaf. The drive lens reads Hybrid (quest-causal plus lyric accumulation), and closure lands as a decisive internal and role change when she becomes the covenant’s keeper. However, the concrete stakes and costs of success vs. failure remain abstract; we never quite feel what’s endangered beyond a poetic sense of “promises” and “future.” The piece still delivers a satisfying before/after, but the cost is more implied than sharply legible.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: arrival with clear intent, ritual escalation, the roots’ demand, the trade, and the dawn aftermath form a coherent causal arc with a clean before/after. Closure is strong Earned Stasis/RR: she chooses to accept her scars rather than keep trading them away, with visible cost in surrendering the child’s name to the orchard. The causal chain (card → stitching → roots’ counteroffer → internal shift) is legible and satisfying. A slightly sharper articulation of what “trammeling fate” risks beyond her own psyche could raise structural force.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present scene in the trailer and quarry, with reflection interleaved and always anchored to sensory triggers. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent—memories and echoes of “After the Applause” build toward the decisive moment where he keeps the cloth and leaves. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he accepts uncertainty and revalues “after” as livable space, with cost rooted in relinquishing an old frame of failure. Stakes are modest but scaled appropriately to the form and land without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: tablet → discovery of the seed → climb → planting → world bending → reconfiguration of his loss and the spirit’s nature. The structure (present Arbor work → brief backstory → ascent and activation → return to the study) holds cleanly under a Hybrid drive lens with both causal progression and accumulative thematic charge. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he reframes the spirit, his grief, and the nature of “leaving,” and the choice to go back “not to stay, but to understand” carries a clear cost and stance. No significant orientation or lens-clarity issues arise, and the final beat tightens rather than diffuses the established drive.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: the woman’s arrival and request give shape to an otherwise meditative scene, leading causally to the smelting and the spoon. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the creel redefined as a repository of possibilities and the spoon’s reflection charging the final lines. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a light causal spine; every beat layers paradox and transition toward the ending image. Stakes and cost are quiet and mostly thematic, but the before/after of Elias’s understanding is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (bunker → deeper caves → shells → pearl → emergence) is clean and easy to follow, with each discovery logically following the last. The closure—a world reconfigured by the inspector’s choice to wear and thus dissolve the pearl—lands clearly on the page as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing with visible consequences. Causality is largely intact, though the leap from personal transformation in the cave to global sky-change is somewhat telescoped and almost too easy. Still, the before/after line is legible and charged, with a coherent drive from mission to defection to redefinition of the “weapon.”

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: station → decision → journey → bridge → charged non-action → directional choice, all under one continuous drive. Causality is coherent (his guilt and profession → search for graffiti/map clues → decision to reach the third bridge → new stance at the end), and the walk compresses smoothly without feeling elided. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise hybrid in his choice to turn right along an unmapped path. Stakes are mostly internal and quiet, which is appropriate, but limit the sense of structural “snap” a hair below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is tight and causal: arrive at library → use watch → glimpse second letter → race to document → library collapses when second letter posts → waking-world choice to write a new letter. The “between two letters” frame and the chime of the second letter posting provide a clean clock and a decisive turn that drives the collapse. Closure is strong: her decision to write a different kind of letter and abandon the watch’s promise delivers a clear before/after with cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the accumulative, slightly lyrical mode still honors causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: object arrives → investigation and visions → moral pressure from plants and knowledge of the collector → deadline → decisive destruction and propagation. The ticking clock (midnight arrival, dawn auction) gives the structure a firm spine, and the final image of the singing garden with Elara accepting being labeled a madwoman delivers on closure with cost. The global drive reads as primarily Situational with causal underpinnings, and that lens holds without wobble. A minor potential lift would be one on-page complication beyond inner debate before the smash, but it’s not strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: corpse → chip → grotto → infusion → encounter → message → return, with each step causally motivated. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal backbone, and the closure is a conceptual repricing: death’s “threshold” reweighted as communicative space rather than final wall. Cost is legible in the spent chip and the quiet burden of carrying the message. The piece is quiet but not static; there’s a single, sufficient tightening around the doorway moment that lands the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and purposeful: fig tree → grotto → offering/pact → vision/ingestion → encounter with the man → quiet coda, all causally linked under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her understanding of grief and contentment—and is paid off in the silver fruit exchange. Stakes and time are well contained in a single day’s arc, with no orientation debt or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: shard → chimes → discovery of cloak → unhooking → altered lighthouse beam → visitor offering to share his burden. The story lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he redefines his role from purveyor of certainty to host of uncertainty, with visible behavioral changes (beam as pulse, not command; not polishing the lens). Causality is coherent and each fantastical element is paid off by the end. The main constraint is that the external frame (campfire, clients, smuggler) mostly decorates the inner arc rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: meditation → deepening trance → memory of student and grandfather → anomaly in the pond’s pattern → partial reversal of aging → decision to descend. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each deepening in trance reliably triggers a new layer of perception or risk. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lesson reframed (vanishing requires appearing) and his aging “stuttering” to sixty-two signals cost. The only limitation is that external stakes remain low-key, which keeps the arc from feeling fully momentous.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: he comes to listen → appraises the flock → detects the anomaly → infers a Hollow Maw → binds a pulse to the arrowhead → endures the Maw’s pass → survives as an anchor. The piece reads under an accumulative/situational lens, and closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: his stance toward stillness is reconfigured and fixed at cost. Stakes and mechanics of “pulse,” Maw, and stone are legible enough, with no orientation debt. The only limitation is that the cost of his final choice is more conceptual than dramatized, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: failure → exile to spire → contact with keystone → shift to impossible garden → encounter with the gardener → return and public choice at the Conservatory. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with an accumulative thematic layer, and closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing where Marlin revalues “sacred” against institutional mastery and automation. The cost—turning his back on institutional validation just as it’s offered—is legible on the page in his indifference to the deans and in physically leaving the keystone. Structure fits the length with one temporal/locational transition that’s clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: lamplighting → festival lantern snagging on the wreck → entering the Marigold → discovering book/key → opening door to the frozen festival → insight and vow → return to the pier with reweighted perception. Structure is single-POV, single throughline with one surreal shard, and the transition into and out of the door-vision is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves with a altered relationship to sound, light, and truth, and the final shimmering waves image crystallizes this. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than dramatized loss, but the sense of private, irrevocable vow gives enough weight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecy → coins as tuning keys → clarified “question” → choice to dissolve → universe reset. Closure is a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: reality reboots to pre-beginning and the prophecy’s meaning is inverted, with the cost of Liora’s prior self being unmade. Orientation is solid from the opening, with the observatory and post-contraction universe quickly established. The only modest limitation is that the mechanics of how her choice reshapes cosmology remain intentionally opaque, tilting the piece more toward lyrical causality than concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovering the recordings → seeking the atlas → using dusk light to crystallize fears → naming and releasing monsters → walking toward new fears, with the closure hinging on the conceptual cost of what he has unleashed. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural drive, and the final reconfiguration—echoes as “sacrifices waiting to be heard”—lands with clear before/after stakes. Structure is tight, one continuous scene with embedded backstory anchored to present stimuli. The main limitation is that no single decisive pivot beat feels like a hard fork in the road; the ritual proceeds with an air of inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: End of Tides → months of observation → experimental ringing → synchronized drips → bay’s reawakening → vow-driven rebuilding. Structure is linear and easy to orient, with a clear mid-beat escalation when the bell “weeps” and the viaduct answers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is partly restored, Elias’s role reweighted, and costs acknowledged. The main weakness is how smoothly the solution works on first serious attempt; there’s little on-page failure or complication before success.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation: walk along the ridge → arrival at steeple → ritual of scent and photographs → burning and vision → resolution in his new intention. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each act (nailing photos, lighting them, releasing the bottle) tightens his options emotionally and leads to the final reconfiguration. Closure is strong: he moves from solitary, penitential watchfulness to a committed choice to record and share Old Hollow’s story, with the cost of relinquishing his private reliquary. There are no orientation issues; stakes, setting, and temporal frame are legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ritualized scene that accumulates pressure and then tips into a distinct new reality. Causality is coherent—crystal to flame to orchard upheaval to glass valley and blue-fire door—and the internal arc tracks naturally with those external changes. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she crosses an irrevocable threshold, reinterpreting the logic/intution divide, with the legible cost of leaving her old world and self behind. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural with solid causal backbone, and it’s held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: radio message → opening the buckle → schematic/mission → jump → descent → securing the payload → silent withdrawal. Closure lands as an earned stasis: she succeeds in preventing disaster but recommits to solitary burden at visible cost (isolation, unacknowledged heroism). The structure is essentially linear with one temporal glide at the end, and there are no serious orientation issues. However, most obstacles remain implicit or off-stage, so the plot feels more like a beautifully rendered execution of a plan than a pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clear: the looming custody hearing and ongoing historical erasure force Kael to attempt an unprecedented mind-merger, which then halts the rewriting and renders the legal battle moot. The piece maintains a coherent single-scene structure in the dojo with one dominant drive—prevent obliteration via state-sanctioned “custody” of his mind. Closure lands cleanly with a decisive change (the merging, empty jars, banners burning, history stabilized) and a reconfigured future. The main structural weakness is that the huge external stakes (the Emperor’s regime, the hearing) are mostly offstage, so the on-page pressure feels smaller than the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious envelope → seed-as-puzzle → Lina’s engagement → planting → business slowdown → communal vigil → bloom and reorientation. The structure is accumulative and time-lapsed but easy to follow, and closure lands in the gathered vigil and “Now we see what grows,” a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the failed business model). No significant orientation issues arise; the escape room/brook frame is anchored early and held. The only limitation is that the sender mystery is left entirely inert—more atmospheric than structurally consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nightly rituals → malfunction of the blower → unexpected genuine laughter → choice to ascend and abandon the old role. Causality is legible under a textural lens—the machine’s failure breaks the pattern and forces re-evaluation rather than feeling coincidental. Closure lands as a decisive change (he joins the household and relinquishes his conduit role) with a conceptual repricing of “tending the unspoken.” The cost is clear enough on the page, though the hourglass motif is more thematic than a live clock on his decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: find pendant → encounter with figure → bargain → unraveling/transition, with no causality breaks. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: by surrendering the key, Lyssa abandons her role and world, paying with self and reality. Stakes and costs are legible on the page, and the before/after is clear despite the lyric style. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with solid causal underpinnings and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: theft → investigation of the crozier’s hunger → forbidden incantation at the nexus → reality-altering event → guild confrontation. Closure lands with a decisive change (Elias’s new power and stance; the guild routed; the world subtly remade) and conceptual repricing of what “vivification” means. The primary weakness is cost: the transformation feels almost unambiguously victorious, with social and metaphysical heresy indicated but not truly biting on the page. Still, structure is tight for the length with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: arrival → ascent → tuning attempt → shattering/revelation → retrieval → leap, with no orientation issues and a legible before/after. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, and closure lands via a clear reconfiguration: the signal internalized, assumptions (including gravity) overturned. That said, the leap and its cost are conceptual rather than truly felt; she rises immediately, which dampens the sense of risk or irreversible loss. Still, the causal and thematic throughline holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story tracks cleanly from routine passage to imminent unraveling to Lira’s deliberate intervention and a reconfigured arrival. The “five minutes before the ferry unravels completely” beat provides a clear tightening, and the hourglass ritual is a concrete pivot that resolves the crisis. Closure is strong—a decisive change plus conceptual repricing around the hourglass and the ferry’s nature—but the cost of success remains largely abstract and offloaded to prior, summarized sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single escalating scene: setup in the uncanny gallery, development with the void and the thread, eruption, then a quiet reset. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the “eruption” of memories and then the gallery resolving into a mere room provide a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Causality is coherent—his preparations lead to the triggered event—and closure lands with the decision to repeat the cycle. The main limitation is that the cost of this loop is more implied than sharply dramatized, so the before/after is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: an opening establishing world and desire, a central lesson with the chain and edges, then a brief time skip to payoff when the city’s navigators adopt the new method. Causality is coherent—aliens reveal a method → Elira experiments → she teaches → the culture begins to pivot—and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the benthic city as “beginning” rather than “end.” The cost, however, remains mostly implied (tradition challenged, risk of the unknown) rather than dramatized in a concrete confrontation or sacrifice. The hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds, but escalation is gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous signal → decision to investigate → object trail (photo, glove) → spectral encounter → reoriented purpose. The story maintains a single continuous scene with a legible escalation from eerie atmosphere to the mist “screaming” to the apparition and personal revelation. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s understanding of his work and of who is calling him changes with lasting implications. The line between hallucination and supernatural event is intentionally soft but not confusing; however, the mechanics of “bringing her back to the photograph” remain more poetic than causally grounded, tempering maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: descent → discovery of seam → phase transition → encounter with the junction box → extraction and return. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the phase mechanics are legible enough to support closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias and the world are re-situated in relation to the “unremembered”—but the cost is mostly conceptual; danger (being “kept” by the facility) is asserted more than directly tested on the page. A slightly more concrete brush with irreversible loss would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: radio silence → anomalous voice/ink → defragmenting archives → realization of the observatory’s emergent consciousness → reconfigured relationship to her “death.” Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure beat—her stance toward the static and her own count—lands clearly as a conceptual repricing with emotional cost. The single-scene frame is coherent and needs no extra shards. A slightly more concrete test of what she risks by engaging the ghost could have heightened the sense of jeopardy without changing the design.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Veyra comes to capture a dying language, uses the diamond through the birds, inadvertently animates the echoes, and is consumed, with the diamond and canyon reconfigured at the end. The piece adheres to one continuous scene with mounting consequences and a clear before/after: language dies, Veyra becomes part of the echo, the diamond's curse redefined. Closure is strong Conceptual Repricing plus cost—her literal death and the quieted diamond—and the late “you were never meant to understand” turn lands crisply. Structure is tight with no dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is coherent: digging → arrowhead → phone → seed → vines → choice → metamorphosis → aftermath, with no orientation issues. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with clear causal underpinnings, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual and emotional cost. Some big beats (the missing returning twice, the cosmology of the “joke”) are handled in summary mode, which slightly blunts impact. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying within the story’s lyric structure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is coherent and cleanly causal: discovery of the shell → musical signaling → crack in the earth → organic resurgence → statues melting → world’s response. Closure is strong, with a clear before/after in the orchard and a reconfigured world implied through distant listeners. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—her exertion and the statues’ dissolution are felt, but she never faces a genuine risk of failure or reprisal. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the arrival of the storm-bottle prompts the alley meeting, which prompts the opening, realization, and subsequent run to the old post office under drone pressure. Orientation is clear early—mailman, disputed strip, drones, arcade—and the single POV is stable. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias reframes his work from mere delivery to deliberately carrying storms to places where broken promises accumulate, with the haunted post office as a concrete pivot. The cost is more conceptual and ongoing than acute, but it is legible and tied to his choice to keep crossing the border.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: find fragment → follow song → enter impossible car → relational exchange → reconfigured relation to silence and work. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a strong causal thread, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost (he accepts that the work never ends but changes its meaning). Stakes stay mostly internal and quiet, and the “wrong turn” magic doorway is accepted rather than problematized, keeping the structure elegant but modest in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: quiet set-up in the browsing library, a mid-story ritual pivot with the scarf, and a resonant reconfiguration the following morning. Causality is intact under a textural lens—Elias’s choice to enact the geometry-ritual transforms the library, which then changes how patrons experience books. Closure lands clearly as a conceptual repricing: the library itself becomes the “place where stories live,” and Elias repositions himself as a “fold in the story.” Stakes remain mostly internal and aesthetic, but the before/after is legible and paid for by the loss of the scarf and the risk of unlocking the restricted section.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: set-up of role and goal, approach to the archipelago, two failed/partial attempts, then a decisive choice, followed by a brief coda in the library and at night. Causality is intact—her preparation and timing lead to the pulsing photograph, which creates the ethical decision point and the subsequent cataloging. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses to bind the dream to a book while accepting a cost in freedom and hunger. The choice is legible and the before/after line—field pursuit vs curated containment—is clear without feeling over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: man arrives with hair, locksmith engages, the ribbon/map event upends the reality, leading to a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is mostly tight, with the meteorite pick, listening, and star-hint all feeding the central transformation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of what locks and freedom mean, with some implied but not deeply dramatized cost. The hybrid causal/lyric drive is legible and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: investigation in the greenhouse → discovery of the wrong sky → mushroom residue and pedestal → partial memory surge → realization of the trade system → deliberate summoning and confrontation. The piece achieves closure via a decisive change and conceptual repricing: Elias chooses remembering, reknits the sky, and faces the thief with full weight restored. Some mechanisms (the single whispered word repairing constellations, the exact rules of the trade) lean on exposition and feel a touch convenient rather than earned through prior concrete tests. Still, orientation is excellent, the drive lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds, and the ending’s cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens with a clean single-scene arc: we move from quiet training to a live test of Kael’s ability as the shadow strains against its prison. Causality is tight—Elspeth’s prepared geometry enables Kael’s annotations, which in turn bind the shadow and produce the glowing “map of reversible paths.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the threat is temporarily contained, but the final image (“learn the cost of coming back” / waiting for the next shadow) reconfigures the stakes. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, so the ending is resonant rather than crushing, but it’s fully legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and satisfying: parapet → veil crossing → exchange and partial repair → return with debt → ellipsis to his ultimate departure, all in a tight causal chain. The closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the village’s miracle, his absence, and the inter-world ecology of wonder and loneliness reframing the opening premise of tending an orchard. Cost is legible—he abandons his rooted life and accepts an ongoing, teeth-bearing debt—and the before/after is unmistakable. The accumulative/textural drive (images of color, doors/veils, cuts and seeds) coheres and tightens toward that final repricing of “wonder.”

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias exhumed the net, attempts to re-stitch it, confronts the final knot, makes a choice, and that releases the drowned. The story maintains a single scene with clear spatial and temporal orientation and lands a decisive change (spirits freed, his role redefined) with visible consequences (prisms shatter, town altered). The "because/therefore" chain holds under scrutiny, with no major unkept setups. Escalation is modest but coherent, hinging on that last knot as a structural fulcrum.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: vault setup → film comparison → conceptual discovery about time → experiment with her own reel → charged final image. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each analytical step logically leads to a deeper re-interpretation of the map and chapel. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the map shifts from boundary to key, with the cost that she leaves with “no proof, only…certainty.” The stakes remain largely conceptual rather than dramatized against resistance, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative frame: Electra discovery → Athene investigation → snow globe anomaly → conceptual understanding → quiet renunciation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses further pursuit and institutional disclosure, accepting the weight of the lie in exchange for letting the threshold remain unopened. The cost is explicit in “Some things were heavier than truth” and the sediment/lie metaphor, giving a clear before/after in her stance; a hair more explicit narrowing of immediate practical options (what she will not do next) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: he encodes, the ghost answers, its need escalates, and his final encoding act resolves the situation. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear very early despite the surreal setting. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: he forecloses becoming the host and disperses the ghost at a discernible cost. A small weakness is that the rules of the code/ghost interface remain abstract, so the exact risk of failure is more atmospheric than concretely mapped.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ascent in the elevator and then onto the ninth floor, organized floor-by-floor, with the diary discovery as the central throughline. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is sound—each new detail (cipher, data, sketch, plaintext “Look up”) reweights her understanding and leads naturally to the final realization. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: the spire’s meaning changes, with “cold” becoming the price of clarity. Stakes remain primarily interior and never face a sharp external test, which slightly limits structural intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: adrift after the string snaps, Elias moves from observing to entering the sky’s memory, then lands with a reweighted understanding that the sky “is the remembering.” Causality in a literal sense is soft, but under a textural lens the progression from drifting, to visionary immersion, to stitched-light landing forms a clean before/after conceptual repricing. The closure image—the restored light-string and his altered stance—lands with quiet but legible cost (surrender of separateness, acceptance of loss). A bit more concrete jeopardy or decision-making under pressure would strengthen the feeling of turn and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: coin → safe → instruction → glass-and-light construction → demolition and fire → post-destruction artistic choice. The ticking-clock structure (one night before demolition) holds, and the library’s destruction plus her stance shift at the end provide solid closure (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). The piece stays in a single POV and essentially one compressed window, with the later “waking” section logically following the hollow’s destruction. A slight softness in the physical jeopardy (her survival and the crew’s behavior are somewhat glided over) keeps this short of exceptional rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: sneaking into the study → phrasebook clue → hopscotch pattern → demonstration to Veyra → ship breaks the loop. Orientation is swift and solid, and the story sustains a single coherent drive (freeing the Folly and Liora earning trust) to a decisive change. The main weakness is how smoothly the solution works—once identified, the hopscotch sequence solves the crisis without real complication or near-failure. Closure is satisfying but feels somewhat low-cost relative to the weeks of drift and “bad omens” setup.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: prior prophecy → return to the hall → mechanical repair → mirror-child revelation → retrieval of the watch → distant door opening. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—the years already spent and the implied risk of reaching into the mirror—culminating in a reconfigured world (“she felt like the key”). Structure is tight for a single-scene lyric piece, though the resolution leans slightly on implication (we don’t see the reunion), keeping it just shy of fully shattering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain from arrival → bell → dream → reexamining cracks → community coalescing → second bell-ringing is coherent and satisfying, with a clear before/after in Veyth’s stance toward its inhabitants. The structure is mostly linear with one gentle montage passage, and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: redefining the nebula as something constructed “with” the world. Cost is implied in Liora giving up wandering for rootedness, though it’s not fully dramatized. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the accumulative drive lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is cleanly linear: lighthouse and job → anomaly (puppet head) → realization of what it can do → sacrificial use → altered state of the world. Causality is tight under an accumulative/lyric lens; each new image (voices, lullaby, key) deepens the same drive toward what to do with the cocooned time. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the clock’s purpose is repriced from countdown to cradle, with Elias’s choice as hinge and visible cost (he forecloses his role and the deferred chime). Orientation is never in doubt despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the blueprint reveals the labyrinth’s intent, Liora learns the birds and mechanisms, she develops the nut-impression method, and the near-dead girl crystallizes her covert role. Structure is linear with embedded backstory, and orientation (who/where/what) is clear early and maintained. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Liora recommits to her burdensome post, uses her last nut differently, and we end on a reconfigured sense of the labyrinth as something that might “remember how to lead people home.” The cost—her continued isolation and delay of any solution beyond guiding—is legible, though not maximally exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—river observation → backstory → chrysalis ritual → encounter with the girl → wading into convergence—builds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration of his stance toward grief. Causality is soft but coherent: the foam patterns prompt the insight, which motivates the chrysalis release and his final choice to stop “building bridges” in favor of dissolution. Closure lands clearly with a before/after in his relationship to guilt, and the emotional cost is legible. The arc is perhaps a touch neat and compressed, with no serious doubt or setback after the central insight.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: patron arrives → request reframes the premise → ritual with the slate → conceptual resolution of what the “glimmering parole” really is → Liora’s stance at the end. Causality holds at every step and the orientation (who/where/what’s wanted) is clear very early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Liora’s role in the cycle crystallizes and the repeated door-chime/next customer motif makes the before/after legible. The main limitation is that the “cost” is largely conceptual and low-intensity, so the final turn feels more like a graceful settling than a pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: fortress → pavilion descent → ritual → return to kitchen, with tight causal links. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the key turn is the successful subsuming of the soldier’s remorse and the resulting shift in Elias’s state (“Clean”). Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he re-enters his routine with a reweighted understanding of his ongoing obligation. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; nothing breaks, but an added complication in the pavilion scene could deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: missing weight → communication breakdown → confrontation in the tower → returned weight and language cards → visible shift at the elevator. The two-shard structure (nighttime confrontation / next-day and evening aftermath) is clear, with a satisfying earned stasis / resonant reconfiguration at the end. The main structural limitation is that the “grudges of thirty years” are largely told rather than put under real on-page pressure, so closure lands more as a gentle pivot than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present action (mirror experiment) interleaves with backstory in a single continuous scene, building toward a conceptual reconfiguration. Causality holds—her long-term self-modification plus this specific canyon/mirror experiment leads to the flood of entangled memories and her final stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external event, but the before/after is clear. The cost and potential dangers of this transformation are only lightly sketched, which keeps the structural arc just short of fully devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain—manuscript → grotto → threshold → chamber of seeds → snapped inversion and loss → emergent single seed and new plan—is clean, legible, and satisfying. The hour-long inversion and collapsing threshold provide concrete constraints that justify the abrupt loss of the chamber and the emotional cost. The closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Lysara moves from following a text to becoming the key, with the cost of losing the greater trove and her brother remaining off-page but felt. Structure is straightforward two-shard (grotto, then aftermath) and fits the length without stray or unresolved set-ups.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: attention → experimentation with the cracks → emergence of song → charged relinquishment of the relic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias leaves the insulator, the grove “keeps” the song, and the possibility of future listeners is framed with a real sense of before/after. Causality is coherent—each step grows naturally from the last—and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities. The cost is quiet but legible: he gives up his relic and accepts that the music belongs to the grove, not to him.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene at the nexus, with a clear beginning condition (exiled tutor reading the hum), middle (the girl’s arrival and the game), and ending reconfiguration (stone passed, covenant “remembered”). Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat—the hum, the board arrangement, the nexus’s pulsing—deepens the central situation rather than advancing a conventional plot, but closure still lands. Causality is soft but coherent: his choice to engage the board and ask why she came triggers the magnetic rearrangement, which then reweights the covenant. Some early set-up (thirteen years with kings, old covenant history) remains mostly atmospheric rather than being tested directly on the page, which keeps the structural impact just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clear and tidy: fireworks-imposed deadline → need to decode diary → frequency device unlocks clasp → reading triggers moral question → device responds to his silence → he chooses action and opens a new “workshop” at the ruins. The two-shard structure (night, then next morning) is clean and the closure is a Decisive Change with visible stakes. Cost—abandoning safe isolation for engagement—is legible in the on-page choice to set up shop in the ruins. The escalation is gentle rather than gripping, but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and linear: theft → planting → bloom → confrontation → insight/aftermath, with no orientation issues. Causality holds under a mostly Causal-with-Textural lens, and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing: the corpse flower’s "wisdom" reframed as a mirror leading to trust in sway. The main weakness is cost: the anticipated consequences of theft evaporate quickly into soft disapproval, so the danger seeded early never fully bites. Still, the before/after is legible and the shift in options (an unlocked vault; a new bridge) reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: inversion → flight through hazards → crack-as-mouth → seed → understanding → new mission, all inside one coherent window. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from line one, and the inversion-hour clock anchors the structure. Closure lands as a clear conceptual reconfiguration of the premise (what resilience means here) with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that very little goes wrong or truly threatens her goal, so the cost at closure is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a causal investigation scene that escalates from anomaly detection to direct threat to conceptual revaluation. Each beat follows logically (survey → strange wind behavior → violent event mimicking past disaster → tactical response with flare → retreat and reframed practice). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines the city as an adaptive system and alters her professional stance, and the bulletin-board image makes the before/after legible. There are no orientation issues or major causality breaks; the only minor limitation is that the city’s “learning” remains metaphorical enough that the ontological status of the anomaly never fully crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: single scene, clear progression from preparation to each successive chime, culminating in the aurora’s transformation and Liora’s step into a new state. Causality is legible—stealing the amber sheet enables the ritual, each chime alters the cavern and sky, leading to the permanent aurora and the world “remembering how to wonder.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules about silence and control are reweighted on the page. The main weakness is that cost and consequence for the village and Liora remain largely implied rather than dramatized, which softens the sense of a decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: we move causally from failure at the pass → flute as accusation → experimental note → fissure opening → apparition of the child → decision to cross and abandon the role. Closure is strong: leaving the flute, stepping through, and the reoriented driftwood create a clear before/after with a conceptual and emotional cost. Stakes around the “weave between worlds” remain somewhat abstract (we’re told it frays, not shown concrete on-page consequences), which keeps the pressure more philosophical than visceral. Still, the causal chain and the earned reconfiguration of his guardianship are solid and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: halo fragment → experimental printing → the press’s autonomous response → cosmic revaluation of self and stars. Causality within the fantastical premise holds—his use of the halo and borrowing practice triggers the press’s transformation and the conceptual “invitation” from the vanishing stars. Closure via conceptual repricing is strong; the last third reweights everything with a clean before/after state. The only limitation is that external stakes remain abstract, so the sense of jeopardy is more metaphysical than narratively tight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous encounter on the ridgeway that escalates from uncertainty to revelation to a new role, with clear because/therefore linkages (pendant hum → woman’s demonstration → abyss response → bridge → his choice to carry the hum outward). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he reframes the mentor’s “absence,” accepts himself as part of the hum, and redirects the magic outward to the villages. Cost is present but more conceptual/emotional than visceral—he forecloses the path of mere courier-of-objects in favor of becoming a conduit that may eventually dissolve him as it did his mentor. Orientation is strong throughout; no spatial or temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: he comes to commune → reads the frost → receives an escalating vision and warning → understands the prism’s danger → chooses to destroy it. The story holds a single scene with one dominant throughline and lands a decisive change plus a conceptual reweighting of his entire project. Cost is legible in his relinquishing both the object and the “proof” he’s sought. Structure is tight; the only small limit to an even higher score is that the internal conflict could be stressed a fraction more before the break.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure (orchard/loom shard → distant-city reply shard) is clean, legible, and lands in a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. Causality is strong within the fable-like logic: bead → weaving silence → dissolving tapestry → seam in the world → lover’s reply. The time jump and POV shift are well signaled and preserve a single throughline of “message sent / message received.” The only limit at this tier is that the crucial rule-set (how silence-threads travel) remains intentionally vague, which suits the mode but keeps it from feeling fully systematized at a strict literary-realism level.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: quakes and abandoned mines → discovery and saving of the silk → deliberate descent → feeding silk into fissure → planetary “sigh” and communal renewal. The drive lens reads Hybrid, with causal beats carrying a strong accumulative lyric texture toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (planet and smith both “awake”). Closure lands clearly on the page, with the silk’s loss and the permanent change in how people relate to the planet. The only limitation is that the process of risk or potential failure in the fissure scene feels relatively smooth, leaving the climax slightly under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: the shard triggers memory and investigation, which leads to the seam, its temporary loss, the reconfiguration of the shards, and finally her passage through. The structure is essentially a single accumulating scene plus a clean transition to “the other side,” with a clear reversal when the seam snaps shut and a resonant reconfiguration when she becomes the map. Closure lands as a conceptual and situational shift rather than a concrete sacrifice, but the before/after is legible and satisfying. A slightly clearer sense of what she leaves behind or risks in stepping through would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a tight accumulative structure: sea glass → anonymous bottles → stone spiral → written reply → decision to let the skiff rot, all coherently linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines what “lightkeeping” means and commits to a new mode of staying with a visible price (abandoning departure). Causality is clean with no teleported elements, and the pattern of signs/messages is taught early and paid off. Stakes remain intimate rather than external, but within that frame the structural arc is fully satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ascent/ritual that culminates in holding the storm and then descending into morning, with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Causality is coherent but gentle; the storm’s threat, the shadow at the water, and her manipulation of the light link logically but with low friction. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she has bought another day at the cost of endless repetition—but the cost is more conceptual than concretely dramatized in this episode. That lack of a sharper on-page consequence or narrowed option keeps the plot from feeling fully competitive at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: wing → discovery of moving ink → midnight visitor with map → journey → communal storytelling → return and reconfigured stasis. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: each step grows from the prior image or realization rather than arbitrary leaps, and the donor heart’s pull is consistently threaded as a motivator. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he returns with an altered understanding of what the heart does and what his role will be, with the dissolved wing and burned-out fatigue as on-page costs. The design is elegant, though the central pressure stays more contemplative than sharp, keeping it out of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: storm → discovery → deconstruction → revelation → ritual of returning → quieted storm and charged final image. Causality is soft but coherent—each step follows from Elias’s established practice of listening to the labyrinth, and the sextant’s dismantling is the central structural hinge. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: sorrow as a measurable weight that must be redistributed, reconfiguring prior details of trees, storms, and broken tools with a real (if quiet) cost. Orientation is flawless; there’s no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—song after song intensifying until the world sings back—builds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration where the realm and Liora both change state. Causality is coherent: her decades of gathering, present-tense singing, and the trees’ responses all feed the final bloom and villagers’ arrival. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; we’re told it wasn’t just the realm dying but her, yet her “release” reads as gentle transcendence rather than a wrenching loss. Still, the before/after of a silent, trapped world versus a singing, permeable one is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: invitation → hidden stair → mirror chamber/Voss → annotated thesis → decision to lock the door, with no dropped setups. The library’s midnight rule and the threshold motif give the structure a satisfying hinge, and the closure (locking the door, revaluing the library as threshold rather than refuge) lands with a clear before/after. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong accumulative texture, and the final conceptual reweighting of “mistake” carries felt cost. The only limitation is that external stakes remain modestly scaled, keeping tension more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain from impossible bread to wheat, to citywide loaves, to the prince’s return is clean and satisfying, and the accumulative structure is well controlled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city stops “adjusting,” the bakery reappears, and the meaning of normality is conceptually repriced. However, the stakes for Liora personally remain somewhat abstract, and the magic functions almost entirely as benevolent inevitability, softening the sense of cost. The final beat with the sign and “coins… felt like enough” is affecting but a touch too neat for truly top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: we move from routine measuring to anomaly (the vow and woman), to the inner door, to the bridge and decisive exit; each step follows causally. The accumulative build of “luminous vows,” collapsing shelves, and increasing slide volatility leads cleanly into the closure where Elias leaves as the library dissolves. Cost is legible: his life’s work and world vanish behind him as he crosses into an unknown. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with textural escalation) and holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is immediate: pier, hidden pirate market, missing father, target named, and stakes all anchor cleanly. The causal chain is tight—Lena’s decision to bait Veyne, his greed-driven responses, and his violation of the truce of hush all lead logically to his doom and her internal resolution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she has achieved what she came for and consciously accepts the cost and limits of that victory. The main structural limitation is that the off-page consequence for Veyne slightly blunts the sense of on-page climax.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal spine: Lira goes to test, uses the compass, discovers the needle pointing at herself, and is then rewritten as the chosen “storm.” Closure is solid: the Decisive Change (becoming the convergence) and the Conceptual Repricing (“The compass had never been broken”) give a clear before/after. However, the cost of this transformation is mostly conceptual; practical or relational consequences remain offstage, softening impact. The drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds, and the final tilt into light and invitation lands.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: funeral → descent with lock → engagement with the painting → memory-combination → opening → unleashed painting → transformed departure. Orientation is strong within the first lines (who, where, emotional when), and the single-scene structure is clean. Closure lands as a decisive change/resonant reconfiguration when Elias effectively swaps the life of the locksmith’s heir for the life of the painter, with cost implied in leaving the lock and shop behind. The one softness is how smoothly the supernatural unlocking succeeds once attempted, slightly undercutting felt risk in the central act.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: fragment → map → descent → Archive → pedestal → writing → return and altered practice. Causality is tight and legible under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (he changes how he writes, and what he does with the new fragment) lands on the page with a felt cost. The Archive trip meaningfully reconfigures his stance toward honesty, not just supplying lore. Stakes stay intimate and could be tested more sharply, but they are coherent and resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → installation of the ice → intensifying motion and sound → shatter → quiet aftermath and reorientation toward the next work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is “already written” as symphony; her role is to tune it, and that conceptual shift feels earned by the preceding images. Causality is simple but solid; no orientation issues or dropped setups. The cost is more conceptual than emotional (truth and wonder are fragile and must be continually re-released), which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the box → resurfaced failure and grief → rising external pressure (magnetic shift, failing systems) → the controlled burn → departure. The story maintains a single coherent drive and lands a decisive change with cost at the end. A slight abstraction in how dire the external systems failure is keeps the stakes from feeling absolutely maximal. Still, structure for this length is tight, legible, and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: locket → mailbox clang → opening the locket → opening the mailbox → communal response, all in one continuous causal flow. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which the courtyard repurposes the once-dead mailbox into a living conduit for unresolved grief, with the locket’s steady tick anchoring the new status quo. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional—reopening the Elena wound and inviting vulnerable letters—but remains understated rather than sharply dramatized. The chosen accumulative/causal hybrid lens holds throughout, with no orientation issues or broken setups.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: years of decoding → dice as final puzzle → triggered failsafe → demanded dance-password → conscious decision to open the lab and flood it → escape and epilogue on the vessel. Orientation (who/where/what) is firm early and the story sticks to a single, legible drive. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the destruction of the lab and journals versus her internal liberation. The structure is straightforward but well-shaped, with no significant set-up/payoff gaps or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean: docks setup → backstory integration → chamber attempt → aftermath on the docks, all under one coherent drive to retrieve stolen memories. Causality is strong (stone’s increasing weight → following the patterns → chamber climax → stone’s disintegration and failed retrieval), and the closure beat clearly reconfigures his options and stance. The cost of the failed “exhumation” is legible on the page (loss of the key, glimpse of her trapped state, shift to grim persistence). It’s very solid but not fully transcendent; the ledger resolution is deferred rather than deeply transformed in concept or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the brook → ritual → backlash when the prophecy thread escapes → partial, texturally reconfigured resolution. Causality within the magic is intuitive (wing to water → constellation lattice → serpent-thread → shattering) and the closure beat—prophecy softened, she finally sleeps—reads as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/lyric lens. Stakes around “world unraveling” remain conceptual and never face a concrete, on-page test, which slightly mutes the felt cost. Still, the piece lands a legible before/after in how the prophecy’s weight functions.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: curiosity → encounter with Veyra → lessons → contract → interrogation → tutor’s disappearance → cyclical reprise with a new tenant. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a strong accumulative texture from recurring motifs (seal, tea, meteors, lies). Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when Elias inhabits the tutor’s role, reweighting all prior “agreements” as potential tombs. One possible heightening would be to more clearly link Elias’s interrogation of the building to Veyra’s vanishing, but the current ellipsis feels intentional rather than sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: desire to preserve memory → concrete method (shell + lattice) → archiving act → confrontation with authorities → conceptual ripple into the wider world. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing where the world begins “remembering back” at real personal cost (her arrest, her emptied chest). There are no orientation issues; the scene’s time and place stay legible and contained. The only restraint on moving higher is that the external conflict with the patrol resolves quickly without a more developed beat of contest.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the forger brings the thorn to the sanctuary, uses it to undo the decrees, which shocks the Emperor into a new stance, leading to a shared rewriting and the political-symbolic aftermath. Closure is strong—a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration—moving from forged cruelty to co-authored truth and a child learning the “new script.” The cost is legible (seventeen years of treason and risk, the Emperor’s abdication of tyranny), though the external danger from guards and regime feels muted and never quite tests the outcome. Structurally, the shift into epilogue (burning seals, the child) is smooth and supports, rather than dilutes, the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the shell’s progressive instructions drive Veyra into the nexus, toward Kaelis, and into the climactic song, followed by a clear coda. The descent structure is tight and legible, with carvings → bones → threads → confrontation functioning as an escalating sequence. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: Kaelis is stripped of power, the webs are destroyed, and Veyra exits having relinquished her role. Stakes and costs are clear without over-explaining, and there are no orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: supplicant arrives → ritual with the globe → revelation about the son → parallel turn to Lena’s own dead → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of wreckage and salvage tightens toward the closing image of cracks and light, with a clear before/after in how the widow and Lena relate to their dead. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing rather than a decisive act, but the cost—choosing honest wreckage over numbing illusion—is legible. The structure is straightforward yet well-shaped for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: a single continuous scene that moves from routine (mending, tea) to demonstration (whistle and minnows) to reconfigured understanding (whisk passed on). Causality is clear—each small step (Liora’s arrival, question, whistle) naturally leads to the next, and the magical response of the fish pays off Kael’s philosophy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the pattern of hidden labor is reweighted in the final image of Liora inheriting the task. Stakes remain intimate, but within that register the arc is complete and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is excellent: who/where/when are clear very early, and the narrative moves in a clean causal chain from arrival → pit → diamond → vision → decision → aftermath. The closure is on-page and legible: Elias’s choice triggers the release/awakening, which erases him and the orchard while seeding a new threat/“cure” and radio signal. The visions neatly repurpose prior information (Liquidation as quarantine) without devolving into an info-dump. The only thing holding it back is that the middle beat (visions, realization) slightly compresses what could be a richer struggle over whether to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece holds a clean causal chain: months of transmissions → storm and crack → forced choice at the portico → radical act that reconfigures his role. Closure is solid, with Elias moving from listener to active prophet and the world visibly shifting (the city rising, storm becoming a crown). The cost is conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete consequences, but the before/after is legible. Structure is linear and coherent for a single-scene arc with light backstory interleaving.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: waking and establishing his practice, the failed attempt to fix the box, the knock as inciting disruption, and the interaction with the girl culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is clear under a primarily accumulative lens: years of collecting → current impasse with the music box → external demand for his skill → choice to share, not hoard. Closure lands on the page with a before/after stance—“not…begging for coins, but…a keeper of the in-between.” The cost is implicit but legible: relinquishing possession as his measure of worth.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is tight: thinning ice weakens the dampening effect, forcing her to use the key and resonator to redirect the bomb’s energy at the known cost to her body. The sequence from maintenance → descent → decision → activation → aftermath is clean, with no unkept setups or late rule changes. Closure is strong: the artifact is stabilized, her ontology shifts, and the world’s “song” is reconfigured, all with clear on-page cost. It just misses the 9-band because the monks/absolution setup, while effective, is handled more as a compact lore insert than an actively unfolding structural thread.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: frozen lake → listening at the viaduct → faint tremor → rising bridge → crossing, with each step logically and tonally linked. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise when the viaduct finally rises and Lior commits to it; the before/after in stance (“The real work had never been in the breaking. It had been in the waiting.”) is clear. The cost is conceptual and social rather than dramatized in concrete consequence, but his turning away from the sanctuary and choosing the lonely, quiet path registers. World rules around the moon-aligned viaduct and the freeze work consistently in a mythic mode, and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: investigation of a grate → anomalous rhythm/whispers → discovery of old symbols → newly bricked wall and fresh mortar → realization of deliberate flooding → decision to go to the archives. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the story ends with a clear before/after in Elias’s mission and knowledge, with stakes and cost implied but not yet paid. The single-scene structure holds together, with no orientation or lens confusion. To move higher, the ending would need a more concretely dramatized consequence or a sharper on-page cost rather than a mainly conceptual one.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: the heart’s arrival → its installation in the music box → the hymn and memories it triggers → the decision to answer the old letter → the storm-bound trip to the post office → the extended campaign of letters. Closure lands cleanly as a decisive change from waiting for absolution to undertaking ongoing reparative work, with emotional cost on the page. Structure is linear and legible, with a subtle but clear escalation of commitment. Nothing crucial is left offstage or patched retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear: workshop → kaleidoscope vision → new wing concept → leap → conducting instead of falling → workshop’s destruction → renewed commitment. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to falling and to the arrow shifts, with the workshop sacrificed and the bell deferred. Cost is on-page (repeated crashes, the workshop’s ruin, her altered body), and the before/after is legible. Structure is essentially a single continuous sequence with embedded past crashes, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous request → number trail → black-box logs → hidden directory → physical server coordinates → breach and self-sacrifice, with no orientation issues. Closure is clear and costly: she triggers a mass restoration and is flagged for termination, reframing deletion as entry into the realm she’s been seeking. Some turns feel slightly convenient or compressed (her ability to unlock core systems and “pull” everything in one go, the archive’s swift unraveling). Still, the structure holds under a causal lens and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the fragment → visions of the girl → preparation at the lighthouse → commitment to step onto the ice. Causality holds under an accumulative/situational lens; each new detail (the fragment’s hum, the mirrors’ whispers, the timing at dusk) narrows Elias’s options. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he chooses to step “into the space between seeing and doing,” with implications of real risk. The main limitation is that the central situation is resolved in intention rather than through a concrete, in-scene confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: wake → contextual backstory → ice incident → parasol revelation → decision to cancel → departure, all under a single coherent drive about how to face endings. Causality is intact and legible; the dog-on-ice beat clearly catalyzes a shift that is then sealed by the engraving discovery and the act of canceling the appointment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the death-plan path is foreclosed, and the final listening to the ice reframes her original quest. The only slight limitation is that the crucial cancellation occurs in summary, not as a dramatized beat, which mutes some potential cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the burned letter triggers memory and reinterpretation, culminating in a quiet but decisive internal shift and return to his sentinel role. The drive is accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he reweights the meaning of the past rather than changing external circumstances. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and remains stable. Stakes and turns are modest, but causality between beats is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear anchors (Lysan, pavilion, parapet, prophet’s recent impact) and a throughline of “can she shore up the clearing against the prophet’s changes.” Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds via deepening: fraying clearings, the parapet’s shiver, the reiterated “You can’t hold it forever.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she stabilizes the clearing “long enough,” leaves with a charged awareness of eventual loss, and the desert’s remembering reframes the struggle. Cost—her acceptance of partial, temporary victory and ongoing burden—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: arrival, contextualizing reflection, waiting for the right moment, the decisive photograph, and departure. Causality is gentle but coherent—her lingering at the whistle site, the appearance of the girl and butterfly, and the chosen timing for the shot all link the town’s history to the new image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the past is now “in the case,” the photo enters communal space, and her own burden shifts. Stakes remain low-intensity and largely conceptual, but the internal narrative arc is tidy and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: experiment with crystal → revelation about silences → global implication via the visitor → decision to join the mapping effort. Structure is tight, essentially one scene with a late entrance that turns the premise outward, and the closure lands as both a conceptual repricing (growth has gone underground) and a decisive change (he leaves to participate). Stakes are mostly intellectual and existential, yet they are handled coherently under an accumulative/lyric lens. There are no orientation issues or broken setups, though the pressure curve remains relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrows and spirals lead to the fog-thickened center, the dancer’s animation, the tape’s voice, and finally the breaking and surrendering of the arrows. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias forecloses his locating-compulsion with visible on-page acts (snapping arrows, leaving chalk, walking to the sea). Causality in the surreal elements (why the sculpture animates, the tape-as-key) is suggestive rather than literal but consistent with the established logic. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: spinning clock → escalating tremors → turret confrontation → touch → metaphysical shift → departure. Causality is legible even in a lyric mode, and the closure—a decisive internal change plus a conceptual repricing of “constancy”—lands clearly. The cost is primarily philosophical, but the before/after is unmistakable (from chasing stillness to moving with the spin). Some midsection reflection slightly softens the urgency signaled by the shaking foundations but doesn’t break the spine.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a present-time hospice scene framed by a brief prelude and coda, all under one coherent emotional arc. Causality is solid—the blood work implies impending death, prompting the requested hymn, which leads to shared memory, loosening, and finally Lena’s decision to release her own talisman. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from carrying her mother’s broken hymn as a wound to releasing it and recommitting to “another goodbye.” The drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the final image decisively reweights the opening without any causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: key → automaton → second keyhole → realization that the observatory is a lock → passage through the sun → library of doors, with each step tightening the situation. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the Spooning/backstory integrates causally instead of feeling like a dump. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara moves from chasing answers to aggressively “kicking in” forbidden doors, with the cost implied by the hunger/shadow imagery and the automaton’s warning. The ending could foreground the concrete stakes of that cost a little more directly, but the before/after is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean and causal: hedge gap → garden → tooth → changeling → memory-flood → bargain → restored brother, with the backstory of the substitute body neatly interleaved and anchored. Orientation is immediate and solid, and the story delivers a clear closure unit in both plot (brother’s return, village restored) and concept (Liora’s new understanding of “setting the world”). The chief weakness is the thinly articulated cost of the bargain—the garden’s rules and the price of reversing a changeling swap remain abstract, making the resolution feel a touch convenient. Still, the before/after of the world’s “crack” is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-tense grotto scene accumulates pressure via interleaved memories, culminating in the girl’s arrival and transfer of role. The drive is largely accumulative/textural rather than causal, but the closure—Liora accepting succession and reframing the villagers’ “miracle”—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible before/after. Causality is simple but coherent (Liora’s history → her practice → her response to the girl), with no orientation issues. The cost is quiet and mostly implicit: Liora yields centrality as keeper and accepts being misunderstood, which suits the mode but keeps the structural impact modest.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece holds a clean, single-scene structure with a Situational/Accumulative drive: viral confession → retreat to the garden → charged encounter → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Lena hands Javier the pendant and explicitly reframes their pain as “soil,” with cost legible in her relinquishing the heirloom and his acceptance of shared burden. Causality is coherent (the confession triggers everything) and orientation is impeccable from the opening line. Escalation is quiet but present; an additional on-page friction point about the confession itself might have deepened the structural arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: city noise → nexus → cameos → faceless man → integration of fragments → Elias’s dissolution, with each step reweighting the central drive (how to relate to the story-current). Causality is soft but legible under a textural/lyric lens, and closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing where Elias literally becomes the current of story. The late external frame (publishers, critics, travelers) is thematically apt but slightly dilutes the immediacy of the core scene’s cost, feeling like a postscript. Orientation is clear from early on (who/where/why), and there are no major logic breaks within the magical realist rules established.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous causal arc from failing arbor to song-based restoration with clear stakes and a satisfying Decisive Change. The grandmother’s warning and the mention that no one remembers the songs set up the need for the remedy well. Closure is on-page and legible, but the path from decision to success is smooth, with no significant complication once she starts singing. The cost is mostly emotional, not structural, so the drive lens feels causal with a lightly pressured escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → sealing attempt → result → realization, with no causality breaks. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she reframes her work and commits to continuing it despite the world’s lack of time, with a legible cost in isolation and endless effort. Setups (storybook plate, orchard, safekept starlight, apples) all pay off in the sealing and the final image of hidden maps awaiting discovery. Stakes stay modestly scaled on the page (the ritual’s success and legacy) rather than dramatized world-level consequences, which keeps this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is a clean accumulative single scene: present-tense tinkering interleaved with backstory that always tilts the current action. Causality is clear (broken timer → study and sketches → reassembly → activation), and the wounded season’s end provides a time-box that tightens toward the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the timer works imperfectly, the season turns, and he chooses to leave it running and delay revealing it, with emotional and temporal costs felt on the page. Orientation (who/where/when, what the mechanism once did) is anchored early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single primary ritual scene in the grotto, followed by a brief village return and elegiac coda, all under an accumulative/textural drive. Causality is coherent—her orientation of the flame leads to burdens calcifying, the grotto’s counter-pressure escalates, and her final merging and later “vanishing” are logical consequences of the grotto’s nature. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elira’s conceptual role re-prices everything that came before, and the cost (her disappearance as a human agent) is legible. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues; the only limit is that the external “come to collect” drive is relatively lightly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is accumulative rather than causal, but the pattern is clean: routine → backstory → external query → dream → altered morning choice. Causality holds at the emotional level; the girl’s question and the dream plausibly precipitate carving the mid-leap lion and her decision not to sell it. Closure qualifies as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines her ongoing practice—still carving, but with a new stance toward keeping/letting go. There are no orientation issues, and the before/after is legible without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: carousel → lagoon-reading → ghost confrontation → multiplicity of selves → jump, all linked by memory mechanics. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses to be taken by her past selves “just until the carousel started again,” a costly surrender framed as temporary. Causality within the world’s rules (lagoon as memory, ghosts as iterations) holds without obvious cheats. A hair more explicit signaling of what “carousel starting again” practically implies would strengthen the felt stakes of that final clause.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: discovery of the sextant → mapping the maze → activating the hydroponics → reimagining the terminal as infrastructure, culminating in the recalibration stance. The piece lands closure through a conceptual repricing of “hope” that clearly distinguishes before/after in Lena’s outlook and in the town’s options. Stakes remain relatively quiet—no concrete external opposition—so the turns feel more like smooth progressions than pressured choices, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: reflection in the sanctuary → trigger in the rain-slick forecourt → decisive act of reconstruction → coda with the imagined elders. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: the preserved whispers lead him to recognize the echoes of his unfinished work, prompting the fracture and reassembly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he stops measuring silence and allows it to measure him—with a legible before/after and conceptual cost (defying elders, breaking the sanctuary’s stasis). Stakes are internal but clearly advanced and resolved without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear pivot at the canal fork and a closure beat when she discards the ledger and turns back to the docks. Causality holds under a largely accumulative lens—her observations and reflections build toward a decisive change in stance with visible cost (abandoning the father’s map-quest). The last broadcast and the sundial’s “inward” shadow tighten that shift rather than feeling like late additions. Stakes remain modestly scaled but coherent, and the Earned Stasis/Decisive Change mix at the end lands without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: Elias examines the rope, uncovers its archival nature, recognizes its kinship to the seed pod, and then performs an integrating ritual that elicits a tangible world response. Causality holds at each step, and the piece resolves in a resonant reconfiguration—he leaves with a new, charged purpose. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, with knowledge and pattern density escalating toward the final act. Stakes and cost remain modest, more conceptual than sharply dramatized, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: hired for a commission, he uses the thread, discovers the locket, arrives at a new stance toward absence and his craft. Causality is soft but coherent—more accumulative than plot-driven—with the magical pull of the thread providing the primary throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his work and future (“cartographer of the spaces between departure and return”), with the garden and thread charged differently than at the start. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatically tested, but it’s present: he accepts living in service to others’ absences.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/lyric skin: long absence of sky-singers → decade of collecting → discovery of egg → sacramental experiment → flawed “hatching” → revaluation of beauty. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and remains clear despite the lush prose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aldric shifts from seeking a perfect restoration to embracing a costly, imperfect genesis, with the world’s physical shudder underlining the stakes. The only thing keeping this from 9+ is that the external consequences of the palace’s instability stay mostly implied rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a lagoon scene with a clear inciting cry and rescue, followed by a quieter station/night shard that reconfigures meaning and lands closure as a charged poise/earned stasis. Causality is intact (coin → coat → rescue → scar-as-song → renewed commitment), and the internal stake of how she will hold her “two flames” carries through to the final alarm. The closure shows a clear before/after in her stance toward her legacy, with cost implicit in ongoing scrutiny and emotional tremor. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: breadcrumbs → Bone Fountain door → box as key → chamber of memories → deliberate tearing free and citywide consequence. Structure is linear, single-scene with one clear escalation, and the closure (memories liberated, fountains weeping light, Liora leaving) lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost. The cost is more implied than dramatized—“Some things, once unstuck, couldn’t be contained”—which blunts full impact. Still, the before/after is legible and coherent under a mostly causal, slightly accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal spine: exploration → activation of the gear → revelation of a new path → memory cost → transit. Closure is solid: she leaves, sacrifices memory, and the pattern is explicitly said to break, giving a clear before/after. Stakes and rules are consistent; there are no orientation or lens ambiguities. The only limitation is that the opposition remains conceptual and off-page, keeping the arc from feeling fully pressured in a structural sense.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: greenhouse scene → spectral intervention and realization → dinner-table reprise, with clear causal links (retrace letters → crack → father’s presence → new carving approach → butterfly trade). The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a solid causal spine, culminating in a conceptual repricing of grief as “hollows” and a “door.” Closure lands strongly in the dinner scene, where the new stance is enacted with visible emotional cost and relief. No orientation issues or dropped setups; the migration clock lightly frames, rather than tightly constrains, the action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single present scene bracketed by the pendulum's pause, with backstory interleaved via sensory triggers, all building to a quiet but clear reconfiguration of Elias's role. Causality is accumulative rather than plot-twist-driven, but the longer, "different" pause tonight motivates his active intervention. Closure lands in the decision to go on carving and in the implied social repercussions of the altered chime. External stakes (the council, concrete consequences) are gestured at more than dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean and causal: chess → sovereign case → each successive knot revealing deeper truths and culminating in a reframed understanding of Hester’s motives and Elias’s role. Each knot escalates consequence (shadows moving, scent of the drowned husband, accusatory voices, then the vision), and the closure beat reconfigures the initial situation into an ongoing “game” of truth-telling. Cost is conceptual and social—unquiet dead, buried crime, impending confrontation—but legible on the page. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative imagery), held consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, a clear progression from arrival to engagement with the spire to the completion of the predictive map. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the hum, the fissure, the first dot, the map’s blooming, and the spire’s song all build toward closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Liora has coaxed the future rather than dictated it, and reality feels subtly altered. The cost remains conceptual and modest, so the final beat is satisfying but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-tense alcove → compressed history of the famine and Ministry → return to the immediate broadcast with Lira → brief future-facing shard with the patrols and graffiti. Causality under a mostly accumulative/causal hybrid is strong: the pirate broadcasts enable Lira to find him, which in turn leads to their shared act and the Ministry’s search. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world has not changed politically, but the dust and language have, at a conceptual cost marked by Elias’s disappearance. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that Elias’s removal happens off-page, with his actual decisive moment elided, softening the sense of a sharply dramatized turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean, continuous scene with an accumulative/textural drive: each pass over the ashes, powder, mask, and gallery deepens the central premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Liora leaves, the “mirage” persists, and the pattern of city-to-city repetition is crystallized with a clear conceptual cost (permanent transience, refusal of safety and understanding). Causality is quiet but coherent—burning the portrait because she “finally understood him too well” is a decisive internal turn. The ending cadence (chair stopping here, another chair elsewhere) ties the loop without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: institutional erasure → threat to the tunnels → Elias’s week-long counter-effort → confrontation and flooding → falsified record and cog’s survival. The structure is essentially single-POV, single-arc with one temporal bridge (“the next week”), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the cog’s silent witnessing versus the official lie. Cost is legible on the page—Elias’s death and the submerging of his hoard—and the final juxtaposition with the clerk’s line tightens the lens. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues; the piece knows exactly what scale of story it’s telling.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene anchored early in the velvet library, with one reflective block about the choir’s dissolution that clearly tilts the present. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the movement from solitary contemplation to collective humming, with the rosette as a throughline, gives a solid Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Causality is modest but coherent—finding the rosette leads to notating silences, to the rosette as “reminder,” to the choice to sing differently. Closure lands with cost (they are remnants, not restored), though the global pressure remains gentle rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: find seed → plant → fruit → understanding → choice of how to use it → new role and future seed. Closure lands as a quiet but clear reconfiguration: he chooses an ongoing vocation (gardener of moments) over conventional success, with the Alignment’s end and single saved seed marking cost and constraint. The off-page social backlash (critics, elders) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of immediate pressure. Still, for this length the progression is coherent with a solid before/after divide.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: storm → blackout → hive failure → riddle/seed decision → drones’ wild rebirth → shifted city response. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: once the seed is spent, the world cannot go back to pure seamless routine, even if the power returns. Cost is implied but real—Elias empties the ancestral box and uses the irrecoverable Last Wonder to jolt the city. Structure is linear, well-contained in a single night, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build from dock arrival to quiet ritual to conceptual reweighting at the end. Cause-and-effect is soft but coherent: finding the shard → coming to the bay → arranging displaced objects → sensory shift and whisper → realization about “alive houses.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of her worldview rather than a decisive external turn, which suits the mode. Stakes remain modest and internal, so the before/after is more intellectual than gripping, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal chain from observation, confrontation, revelation cascade, to decisive act and transformation. Each revelation changes the meaning of the mission (city planted; child not monster; poison’s true target), tightening options toward the choice to open the dome and repurpose the ampoule. Closure lands solidly with both a Decisive Change (city begins to rise, human transformed) and a Conceptual Repricing (weapon→womb; poison→pigment), with clear cost (old world/root relinquished, human’s prior self and air-breathing life forfeited). No orientation or lens ambiguities impede comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight: endless climb → reflective math/backstory → creak/rupture → experiment with dice → appearance of door → refusal and return. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/conceptual lens: her past theorem and current proof drive the staircase insight and the sideways leap, not a random miracle. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses rewriting the past while revaluing the loop, with the smooth die left behind as on-page cost. The single continuous scene with one temporal bleed (café memory) remains clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense painting, brief anchored memories, then a charged sequence with the new leaf, sleep, and transformed morning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world and his practice are subtly but decisively reweighted (smog thins, rain-scent, brush worn, strangers stirred) while his constraint (insomnia, need to keep writing) persists. Causality operates in a lyric mode but holds: persistent inscription → fig’s response → his first sleep → city’s change. The cost is quiet yet legible, centered on his exhaustion and the brush’s finite life.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: the dry loaf and boy’s comment → lens experiment → discovery of trapped hands/voices → realization about absorption → decision to shatter the lens and redistribute its power → communal baking and hive return. Structure is essentially single-POV, hybrid causal/accumulative, with one tight escalation and a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands: Liora’s choice forecloses solitary custodianship in favor of communal practice, with the cost of destroying a singular artifact and embracing a more diffuse, less controllable magic. Stakes and cost skew conceptual rather than visceral, so while the arc is coherent, the sense of risk or irreversibility could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: years of reverse-engineering → assembling the lighthouse mechanism → initiating the sequence → opening the path → stepping beyond, with clocks subsequently running backward as a clean, legible consequence. The piece reads as a Hybrid (causal plus accumulative/lyric), but the causal spine holds, and the closure unit (Elias crossing the threshold and the world subtly reconfigured) lands with conceptual cost. Orientation—who, where, when—is established quickly and never lost despite the density of imagery. The only structural limitation is that some large consequences (world time reversal) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: resuscitation → photographic curse → advisor’s mandate → funhouse entry → mirror ingress → confrontation → unbosoming → reconfigured self. The single-scene structure with one surreal transition (through the mirror) is legible and supports a decisive change plus conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands clearly: he alters his relationship to fear/self, carries a new cost, and the world’s rules (photos, clasp) now reflect that shift. The only reason this doesn’t push into 9+ is that the confrontation is won on the first gambit, with limited complication or tactical adaptation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: a sequence of musical strikes alters the sky, leading to the unexpected sea-voice and a culminating strike at the orchard’s heart. Causality is coherent—each action elicits a response—and the pattern of call-and-response trains the reader smoothly toward closure. The ending functions as a Charged Poise: options (sink, soar, be destroyed) remain open, but his stance and the storm’s role are reconfigured with clear before/after legibility. Cost is more conceptual than visceral; the narrative hints at risk (prior damage to a ship, unstable orchard) without dramatizing a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: new crack → whistle sequence → shell reply → watchers’ turn and advance → revelation of twin gate → Elyas’s choice to go. The piece achieves closure via a charged poise/incipient decisive change as Elyas steps through the watchers toward the reactivated gate, with a before/after clearly implied for both him and the city. Cost is legible but mostly conceptual (abandoning the city, joining the “taken”), rather than anchored to a concrete, dramatized sacrifice. Structure holds as a single accumulating scene without orientation issues, though the revelation about the twin gate verges on exposition rather than emerging from a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: recovery of the Codex → warning text → arrival of Callahan/police → Elias’s pivot from artifact theft to systemic exposure, culminating in his chosen exit. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Elias commits to exposure despite legal and moral fallout, reconfiguring the scene’s meaning from theft to revelation. Stakes and situation stay legible throughout, and there’s no orientation debt. The only limit is that the off-page cost (what exactly happens with the police, the Church, Callahan) remains mostly conceptual rather than tangibly staged.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: one night at the pavilion leading into a brief morning/library coda, all under a coherent accumulative/textural lens. Each step follows causally—survey → discovery of note → reply → dream → trade of inkwell → conceptual vocation—culminating in a quiet but clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The drawbridge/time constraint is more atmospheric than structurally urgent, so escalation remains modest rather than gripping. Still, closure is legible and on-page, with the inkwell trade providing a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the damaged stamp → hypothesizing coordinates → consulting the map → finding the chamber and the book with his life recorded → reinterpreting the blackout and library as intentional. Structure is linear and coherent, with a single transition (worktable to hidden chamber) and a clear closure beat when he chooses secrecy and continued work. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis rather than a decisive external turn, with the cost inferred in his acceptance of a constrained, half-secret role. The one limitation is that no beat meaningfully threatens failure; discovery feels assured once the clue appears, muting structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from the nearly finished basilica and sinking isle to the gem insertion, pain, partial dissolution, and final transformation, with clear cause-and-effect at each step. Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) is established early despite the lyric mode, and the pattern of dream-recording and sinking/unfolding is taught then paid off. Closure is solid: her choice to complete the transformation and “let go” reconfigures the original problem (the isle sinking) into a different kind of ascent, with a visible emotional cost. A slightly clearer articulation of the stakes of refusal (what if she *didn’t* finish this) would sharpen the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine—hospital → stolen footage → father’s notes → observatory activation → glimpse of unmade moment → reframed goal—is clean and legible under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she fails to alter events but succeeds in reweighting what “potential” and awakening mean to her. The threat of collapsing the field and the fate of the observatory are gestured at more than dramatized, so the external consequence of her act feels a bit soft. Still, the before/after in her stance is clear and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scene is cleanly structured: arrival → surveillance → theft of the chip → observatory activation → shared revelation. Causality is solid, with the chip’s movement triggering the door and constellation, leading directly to the emotional closure. The drive reads as Hybrid (causal with a strong accumulative/lyric texture), and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where belonging is redefined—lands clearly. Stakes remain small in scope but are fully coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: single scene, single POV, with a clear because/therefore chain (terrace ritual → confrontation with relic → renunciation of object → discovery of Harkin’s note → decision to go). Closure is a Decisive Change and a Charged Poise: he commits to meet tomorrow’s date, reconfiguring his relationship to truth and his own past work. The supernatural-ish appearance of the note reads as motif-consistent rather than a deus ex machina. Stakes are modest but coherent, rooted in personal accountability and the risk of learning what happened to Harkin.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: meeting on neutral ground → refusal to release the boy → Elias reframes the trade → Kaelis accepts → Elias delivers the nephew and faces the boy’s question. The structure (parapet scene plus brief descent to the boy) adheres tightly to one central throughline without digression. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boy’s freedom is secured at the cost of leaving the war intact, and Elias’s “trade” is explicitly reweighted as time rather than absolution. The scene doesn’t push into complex reversals, but it doesn’t need to; the quiet earned stasis reads coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story holds a clean causal throughline (launch → decision not to leave → letters → bar) under a situational/accumulative lens, with each move narrowing his options to “stay and face” rather than “leave and evade.” Closure lands clearly as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: he chooses to stay local, engage with his past, and redefine navigation. Setups (compass, poles, letters, bar) all pay off without teleports or amnesia. The cost of this new course—sitting with regret instead of outrunning it—is legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: procedure → possession of baseball/newspaper → coded map → tunnel journey → lake choice → altered emergence and confrontation with the former victim. The story lands a decisive change at the lake, with the tunnel collapse underscoring the cost and irreversibility. The chess scene works as a brief coda that confirms the new stance without soft-resetting the conflict. Structure is straightforward but strong; there’s room for a slightly sharper on-page articulation of what he’s truly risking in using the baseball, beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: phoenix → thin veil → first tentative conjuring → bolder, dangerous conjuring → metamorphic acceptance. Causality holds throughout, with the spices and beasts functioning as consistent magical logic rather than arbitrary flourishes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Liora cannot reclaim her brother and instead becomes a bridge between beasts and the transformed world, with visible cost in his permanent loss. The drive feels Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric texture), and that lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: she brings the saucer to the glade, uses ink, reveals the reservoir of time, encounters her brother, and is forced into an internal reckoning that culminates in letting go. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a strong causal spine under a lyric, accumulative surface. Closure is a decisive change in stance (releasing grief and leaving the glade) with legible cost—she cannot bring him back, only reframe the loss. The only limitation is that the rules of the magic system (why this glade, why now) are gestured at more than stress-tested, keeping structure just shy of fully airtight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: centuries of preparation → on-page attempt and failure → reset with “Try again” → second attempt that succeeds and transforms the situation. The drive lens reads Hybrid but resolves under a causal throughline, and the closure (the ship vanishing, Lien stepping into a new world) lands with a concrete before/after. Stakes and cost—abandoning the ship, losing the identity of “last human”—are legible without over-explaining. The only softness is that the second attempt feels slightly friction-light compared to the build-up, but not enough to break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine—beach → cave detour → prophecy → deliberate fulfillment at lava → raft/island—reads cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens, with each move tightening the thematic frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she literally trades light for fire and emerges altered, with a new island and future implied. The cost is legible (she destroys her vials and abandons her prior mode of giving), and no setup is left hanging. Stakes remain more metaphysical than concrete danger, which slightly mutes the felt jeopardy of the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: sundial cipher → engineered blackout → access hatch → armory opened → signal given, with the revolution as a decisive on-page turn. Closure is solid: the world’s options have changed, and Kael’s disappearance into dawn reads as an earned new stasis/charged poise. The primary weakness is how smoothly the execution goes—no meaningful complication in the gearwork scene—and the cost of success (personal risk, collateral stakes) is mostly implied rather than concretely dramatized. Still, for this length, the drive lens (causal) holds and the ending lands.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rock placement → dust activation → aurora ring and voice → water-mirror threat → push and restoration, all under one continuous scene. Causality is legible and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—she moves from trying to read the pattern to becoming its anchor and accepting the ongoing burden. Stakes around “harness it, or it will unmake you” and “something…wanted the promises broken” are clear enough, though the exact consequences of failure stay a bit abstract. Orientation and lens remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight: one continuous storm-scene with interleaved, well-anchored flashes to the darkroom that always return to the observatory and timer. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is clean—storm + timer + poem + scars → decision to let the storm “edit,” then to destroy and release the poem. Closure is strong: a resonant reconfiguration where his stance toward his work and scars decisively shifts, with felt cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the through-line never wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: the wait for the verdict → fencing as negotiation → deciphering the sundial → revealing the Council key → choosing to bypass the Council’s authority. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and mild Conceptual Repricing: they reframe the verdict as irrelevant and reconfigure their relationship from rivals to collaborators. The cost is mostly conceptual/political and somewhat underplayed, as we never glimpse direct consequences of defying the Council. Structure is tight and linear, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single night in the library that moves from arrival under the awning through shared work to dawn, with the tin, violet, and name-itch acting as spine. The drive is largely accumulative/textural—each small act (sorting, adding to the tin, the lie, the violet’s transfer) layers meaning rather than triggering sharp turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: by dawn, his stance toward staying is reweighted, the itch quiets, and the library’s collective “we” feels newly foregrounded. Stakes and the threat of the guards stay mostly abstract, so the causal pressure never tightens as much as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: years of preparation with compasses and film lead to a single-night execution that opens the door and consummates the wait. The structure is essentially one continuous escalation from arbor/station to refuge room, with no confusing jumps or unkept setups. Closure is solid—a Reunion / Resonant Reconfiguration where time’s rules shift and her options are reweighted—but the story never makes the cost of failure or delay bite as hard as it could. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric texture, and it holds consistently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: monsoon coming → dreams turning dangerous → Manik’s loss → discovery and use of the seed → Liora’s transformation. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the ridge/monsoon clock provides a simple but effective structure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the island is not an archive but living memory, and Liora becomes its voice at the cost of her identity. The only slight limitation is that the critical tactic shift (biting rather than planting) arrives quickly, with minimal on-page testing of alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene accumulating toward the compass activation and the planting decision, with backstory anchored and sparingly used. Causality is clear (compass found → pattern read → magic activates → emotional reconfiguration), and the closure—the bonsai embracing the compass, Elias’s stance to the horizon reweighted—lands with felt cost. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural with a light causal spine, and that lens holds through the end. Stakes remain purely internal, but the change in his options for living with loss is legible and earned.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative arc, effectively using the "week passed" compression to show gradual change. The closure—a decisive email and a shift in worldview—is earned and legible, though the pacing of the realization feels slightly rushed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative establishes a Causal drive (finding the ledger leads to the brother), but the ending breaks this logic for symbolic convenience. Navigating a specific smuggler's route via breath and frost patterns rather than the salvaged data defies the established reality. The closure relies on a lyrical "Conceptual Repricing" that bypasses the practical difficulty of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is cohesive, moving from stasis to action to a new equilibrium. The magical causality is consistent within its own logic, though the resolution—where the storm simply welcomes her—feels slightly convenient, bypassing a deeper complication or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from disruption (package) to resolution (lighthouse) with a clear resonant reconfiguration at closure. The "impossible space" logic holds well enough for fable, though the mechanics of the swim versus the library's interior state create minor orientation friction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on broad summary over a long timespan, violating the short story scope default of a continuous scene or braided shards. The resolution breaks causality; the soldiers, established as ruthless enough to torch the arbor, retreat solely due to a sentimental assertion ("You don’t arrest a man for feeding the hungry") that contradicts the established threat level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression where success is immediate upon performing a ritual, lacking causal friction or cost. The closure provides "symmetric satisfaction"—the environment cooperates fully and the jade vanishes conveniently—rather than a resolution born of difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is sound, moving clearly from the inciting incident with the fragment to the climactic escape via geometry. However, the resolution—where throwing the fragment "unravels" and resets the garden—feels slightly convenient, resolving the physical threat a bit too neatly alongside the philosophical realization.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The climax relies on a cartoonish convenience—a piano key triggering a trapdoor under a guard—which shatters the gritty tone and causal credibility. The puzzle-solving aspect is handled in summary, skipping the struggle of decoding in favor of instant success.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ritual structure provides a functional arc, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of trust. However, the physical threat (rising water) and the emotional quest (hearing trust break) run on parallel tracks that only loosely converge, softening the causality of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story suffers from a "rule of cool" resolution that breaks causal continuity; the stationmaster's gun is introduced but immediately rendered irrelevant by magical light. The logic of the ending—breaking a mirror to "break time"—feels like a convenient escape rather than a derived consequence of the heist mechanics established in the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured, moving from the inciting return to a decisive, irreversible climax (turning the valve). The discovery of the second bookmark serves as a solid causal hinge that recontextualizes the "failure" as a planned collapse. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change that permanently alters the setting, followed by a thematic shift to the observatory.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands with a tangible discovery (the ledger), but the path to it relies on a "magical GPS" beat where the shell dictates the exact location ("Third shelf, behind the atlas"). This reduces the protagonist's agency in solving the puzzle herself.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyric structure is legible and coheres around a clear closure unit (Conceptual Repricing: the map is erasure). The pacing works well for the scope, though the "twist" is somewhat intellectual and low-pressure rather than dramatically urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path of discovery, but lacks a "middle" where the protagonist faces a complication or failure before success. The "void" sequence dissolves the scene's grounding too easily, effectively teleporting the character to the answer, and the closure relies on a purely conceptual realization without a demonstrated price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic art" resolution where abstract doodles instantly fix a complex relationship conflict. This lacks earned causality; the couple's immediate recognition ("That's— Us") strains credibility and skips the necessary struggle for reconciliation. Closure is unearned because the protagonist pays no price for the intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the central conflict evaporates immediately upon the elders seeing the vines; this is the "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern. There is no cost paid for the resolution, and the sudden acceptance by the elders lacks causal grounding in the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident and a legible conceptual closure (time as sideways). The causality holds under a Situational lens, though the "sideways" mechanics are soft; the ending lands a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration of the specimen's state.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible, but a significant loose thread undermines the climax: Elias finds a "rusted key" alongside the program, pockets it, and never uses it. Introducing a physical key in a scavenger hunt setup that resolves purely through music violates the principle of Chekhov's Gun and distracts from the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is decisive and costly; the choice to abandon the station creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the oracle archetype with irreversible consequences. The drive lens (Situational/Hybrid) holds firmly, with the storm’s arrival acting as the inevitable, pressure-cooked answer to the inciting radio call. The "unraveling" creates a legible before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and driven by a coherent causal chain: the father's confession drives the entry, the valve turns the pressure, and the release yields the ghost and the resolution. Closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elias's purpose. The inciting incident (confession) is backstory, but it effectively charges the present-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure functions as a situational loop, effectively showing a ritual of endurance. However, the narrative lacks a decisive turning point or pressure that forces a reconfiguration of the status quo; the ending feels like a reset rather than a closure with a freshly paid cost. The "inciting incident" for this specific moment is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative structure is clear, but the resolution relies on a "magic fix" (the ridge literally singing, the song curing the stroke patient) that bypasses earned causality. The closure lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, offering a "gain-only" happy ending that reduces narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    The closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing (the "trade" revealed), and the logic holds within the dream-like lens. However, the specific causality—burning a diary to mechanically animate the tapestry—feels like an unestablished magical convenience rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative relies on a slippery tense shift at the climax—moving from the conditional ("The train would leave at dawn... The men... would find") to simple past ("Chen closed his eyes")—which creates momentary confusion about whether the departure is real or imagined. The "ticket in the pocket" reveal resolves the central tension too conveniently, reducing the causal pressure of the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The loop mechanic integrates well with the narrative structure, creating a coherent causal chain. However, the extended epilogue with the novice explains the resolution and theme rather than letting the priest's sacrifice stand as the definitive closure, softening the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from routine to resistance under the Accumulative lens. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Li Wei reframes the noise of the ice as a symphony he controls, satisfying the setup with a legible conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound; the move to go "sideways" rather than backward is a clever causal pivot that feels earned by the established rules of the tablet. Closure is decisive and resonant, with a clear cost paid (the destruction of the artifact and the physical burn) leading to a distinct new status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scene flows with a clear arc from isolation to connection, and the closure effectively reconfigures the meaning of the broken needle. However, the resolution relies on a "magical object" handed to a passive protagonist rather than an outcome earned through active tactical choice or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving from atmospheric tension to a decisive shift in the protagonist's stance (Charged Poise). The causality is clean—the arrival of the message forces a recontextualization of his role from passive observer to active witness—and the closure lands with resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is strong: the scent triggers tears, the tears physically feed the plant (observed on page), leading to the realization. Closure is decisive and costly (abandoning his trade and home). The epiphany is dramatized through action rather than just internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a coherent Conceptual Repricing (rope to ladder) with thematic resonance. However, the climax relies on magical convenience ("snapped... from resonance") rather than protagonist agency, and the final line contradicts the physical grounding established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational/Accumulative drive, moving from isolation to connection through the catalyst of the girl. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration ("hush... learned to sing") that feels earned by the prior scene work, though the cost is largely conceptual (abandoning the father's melody) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight, utilizing the static sensing mechanic to pivot the plot naturally from a commercial transaction to a moment of ethical correction. Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the "Resonant Reconfiguration" requirement by permanently altering the client's emotional state and the protagonist's understanding of her role.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure collapses under the weight of the central coincidence: Elias just happens to carry a misdelivered locket that belongs to the exact woman he is watching. This contrivance *resolves* the primary tension (trust) instantly, violating the rule that coincidence should complicate, not solve. The ending dissolves into summary ("By dawn, they'd drafted a plan") rather than a dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative sets up a search for an elusive figure but resolves it with convenient immediacy; Reed finds Syl simply by walking to the crater's lip. The "search" lacks structural weight or complication, deflating the tension promised by the "ghost story" setup. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the resolution robs the final image of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The resolution relies on a magical object (the jar) revealed only at the climax without sufficient prior establishment, which weakens the causal chain. While the "echo's leash" is a beautiful image, its function as a problem-solver feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a climax that forces a Conceptual Repricing. While the closure is distinct, the final "workshop" coda drifts into summary, slightly diluting the immediacy of the cavern exit.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers a catastrophic causality break in the climax: a fragment of ferromagnetic tape cannot play audio "clear as a bell" simply by spinning in a draft; it requires a playback head and amplification. This "physics amnesia" invalidates the central mechanism of the revelation. Additionally, the coincidence of the protagonist having the exact tape and photo of the stranger below is contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path under an Accumulative lens, but the turning point rests on a convenient microscopic observation. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wild garden), but the lack of resistance or complication makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the closure relies on a "magic fix" where the sacrificed brooch returns and the rain straightens, negating the necessary narrative cost. The resolution explains the mystery ("brooch... had been an offering") rather than letting the ambiguity resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" encounter where an entity clarifies the plot and theme in dialogue. While the renunciation of the pearl provides technical closure, the causality is weak because the protagonist is guided to the conclusion rather than arriving there through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Word spread... By the time") to span years, which dissipates the immediate scene tension expected in short fiction. While the closure (giving the valve away) is resonant and structurally sound, the montage middle creates a gap in the causal chain, replacing dramatized struggle with generalized success.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear, with a solid orientation and a distinct causal chain leading to the vault. The closure—marking the map with a crease instead of ink—is a strong example of Conceptual Repricing that grounds the internal change in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from resistance to acceptance, and the closure (letting the parchment go) functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The resolution, however, feels somewhat soft; the realization that "the magic was in the trying" reads as a familiar trope that resolves the tension without a sharp, irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, but the causality is soft; the amulet functions as a magical key that solves the protagonist's boredom without a tactical tradeoff. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the cost (losing the hiding place) is negligible since the protagonist already disdained it.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative drive is strong, with a clear causal chain leading to the climax. Closure is achieved through a "Conceptual Repricing" where the rigid rules of the world soften into chaos, though the physical escape ("funeral home didn't stop them") feels slightly less earned than the thematic resolution. The cost—the loss of Lira's ordering principle—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    Spatial orientation is contradictory; the protagonist presses his ear to a desktop dome while simultaneously occupying a "pavilion between twisted trunks," creating an unresolved scale paradox. The closure is a soft cyclical reset that maintains stasis without a decisive change or legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is executed with precision; the gathering of fragments builds coherent pressure toward the release. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical act of submerging the ledger provides a definitive end-state with felt conceptual cost. The timeline and causal links are seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dissolving journal creates excellent causal pressure, but the climax relies on a "deus ex machina" where the grandmother's voice explains the plot's resolution ("You were meant to add to it"). This "explain-everything" moment resolves the tension without requiring the protagonist to solve the problem through fallible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (embedding the chip) creates a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the stakes. However, the causal mechanism—a graffiti mural effectively instructing a chaotic city to reorganize overnight—relies on a convenient "dream logic" that strains plausibility under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tightly structured around the shrinking window of time (dawn/drones), creating effective situational pressure. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration—the physical crater is lost, but the "lie of permanence" is secured. The pacing matches the "accumulative" lens well.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure that lacks a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration"; the ending is a return to stasis with no felt price. The resolution is mechanically efficient but dramatically inert, as the problem is fixed instantly with a convenient tool ("sliver of iridescent film").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causality follows a coherent dream-logic suitable for the genre, with a clear inciting incident and a Decisive Change at closure. The narrative loop is closed effectively, though the "you have always been" revelation relies on circular fate rather than active causal compounding.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path with no meaningful causal turns or deviations. While the closure—a realization that maintenance is eternal—is conceptually sound (Resonant Reconfiguration), the journey toward it lacks resistance; the town yields immediately to his tools, and the "late" voice dissolves without forcing a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ellipsis ("three days later") elides the causal mechanism of survival, relying on a "miracle" that functions as a soft reset. While the conceptual closure is clear, the reliance on an epilogue to deliver the resolution dissipates the scene's accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a clear goal through rising action to a resonant closure where physical failure (death) is reconfigured as narrative survival (the name). The coda effectively cements the "Conceptual Repricing" of the ending, validating the cost paid in the main scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully executing a Situational loop where the protagonist pays a heavy cost to maintain a precarious stasis. The causality of the magic system is legible, though the ending's explicit confirmation of the cycle ("Liora... would answer. Again.") softens the climax's finality, trading decisive change for fatalistic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative logic where obstacles yield instantly to magical intervention, lacking causal friction or setback. Closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the transformation renders the outcome inevitable rather than earned by the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is coherent but lacks tension; the narrative is a smooth, linear progression from arrival to success without complication or setback. The dream sequence bridges the gap to the climax too conveniently, removing the need for a decisive, high-stakes action in the waking world.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and creates a complete "job" cycle with clear orientation and linear causality. The closure (mailing the letter) functions as Earned Stasis, but the cost is largely abstract ("weight of the future") rather than a visceral or dramatized price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story builds a tangible political threat (coup, bullets) but resolves it with an abstract magical broadcasting mechanism that feels convenient. The pivot point—"stories stop everything"—functions as a thematic assertion rather than a causal mechanism, softening the climax into a metaphorical victory that sidesteps the physical danger established by the courier's warning.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from hesitation to a decisive action (sending the message) that provides closure. The "soft reset" of the immediate magical healing slightly undercuts the physical stakes established by the cutting ritual. The causality is functional, driven by the spirits' prompts, though the ending leans on a summary of the resolution rather than lingering on the fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean situational vignette, and the closure (giving the coral) lands with genuine cost. However, the final image of the glowing cast risks a late genre break into fantasy that jars against the established psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path (find, develop, project) with legible closure in the form of a Conceptual Repricing (the orchard recontextualized as a promise). However, the progression lacks a "micro turn" or meaningful obstacle; success is immediate and essentially guaranteed, making the structure feel more like a procedural sequence than a plot under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The loop structure effectively builds the surreal logic, but the coda ("The nickel, now, is yours") breaks the narrative frame. This shift to direct address dissolves the specific tension of Liora's fate into a generic invitation, weakening the closure's finality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.9)
    The "three weeks later" transition dissipates the scene's accumulated pressure, flattening the narrative arc into a summary. Crucially, the resolution relies on a logic break: a Ministry of *Cognitive* Revenue inexplicably searching for contraband produce rather than coded syntax, undermining the story's central premise.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure follows a clear dream-logic progression, but causality is soft ("singing turns ghost to kelp") rather than earned through hard choices. The closure—sealing herself in—is a resonant reconfiguration, but the "soft resets" of magical healing lower the causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from stasis to inciting action (lighting the chime) to a high-cost resolution (total ruin) without wasted motion. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the destruction of the library is a felt, irreversible price that recontextualizes her life's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story relies on a "magic solves the plot" resolution where singing causes the antagonists' torches to simply extinguish, a soft causal link that bypasses confrontation. While the "loom" realization is clever, the lack of a felt price for such powerful magic (beyond a broken inkwell) weakens the closure's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative builds tension effectively but resolves it with a "soft reset" ending where the antagonists capitulate immediately upon seeing a blueprint. This lack of resistance invalidates the established threat of the elders (who exiled her father) and robs the climax of causal weight or earned cost. The resolution feels unearned, relying on a convenient change of heart rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight, leading to a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to his past. The timeline of a pigeon flying at night and returning by dawn strains biological credibility slightly, but the structural pacing is otherwise flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a "scavenger hunt" logic where clues (logbook, grain, husk) are found via convenient intuition rather than active deduction or struggle. While the closure (climbing down) is physically distinct, the transition from a survival search to a mystical lesson deflates the causal tension. The inciting incident promises a rescue thriller, but the structure delivers a low-stakes allegorical drift.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vignette structure is legible, centering on the "luminous respite," but the narrative arc relies on a "meet-cute" logic that bypasses causality. The closure—Elara remaining below while Kael leaves—works as a resonant image, but the emotional shift relies on the assumed weight of the moment rather than developed narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "because I said so" climax where the central conflict (missing pieces) is nullified by a sudden, convenient realization rather than solved through causal action. The link between cutting a thumb and understanding the universality of memory is tenuous, making the closure feel unearned and the stakes irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is solid, tracing a clear arc from preparation to execution to a reaffirming closure (Earned Stasis). Causality is driven by the internal logic of the performance, which holds together well. However, the lack of significant external obstacles or consequences makes the trajectory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear ritual, but causality operates on soft dream logic where obstacles are nonexistent. The "nostalgia ban" and the mechanics of the "anchored dust" are under-explained context that doesn't pressure the plot, making the successful outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece operates as a beautifully rendered vignette rather than a story with a structural turn; the ending ("He always did") reaffirms the status quo without a legible cost or decisive change. The narrative is a ritual loop that lacks the required reconfiguration of stakes or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is strong and resonant; the decision to leave the box and send the image functions as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost. The pacing works well within the single scene, effectively using the flashback to the call to drive the present-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where the pressure of the tide forces a magical breakthrough, offering legible closure via Resonant Reconfiguration. The transformation of the grotto effectively externalizes the internal realization, though the mechanics of the resolution rely on dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The mechanism of the climax—opening a sealed door with a single match—lacks established causal logic, reading as convenient magic rather than an earned breakthrough. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the door simply vanishes and is replaced by a glowing threshold, bypassing the need for a concrete resolution to the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette rather than a developed story, lacking the structural deepening required for this length. Closure is weak; "she vanished" dissolves the tension rather than resolving the causal stakes established by the illegal transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and the situational pressure (the history, the clipboard) effectively forces the closure. The ending line ("Next time, bring stronger ink") is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that acknowledges the cycle while accepting the current peace. The pacing works well for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal obstacles or meaningful deviations; the protagonist executes his plan exactly as intended. While the closure provides a clear image, the lack of resistance or complication makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fable logic with a clear beginning, middle, and end, satisfying the basic requirements of the form. However, the progression is mechanical: she approaches, solves three knots without failure, and leaves. The lack of causal complication or unexpected obstacles makes the structure feel like a checklist rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story operates in a reflection-led mode that exceeds the standard allowance (>50% backstory/interiority) without sufficient on-page micro-choices to drive present momentum. The structure is static; the inciting pressure (the miner) is distant, leaving the present timeline devoid of urgent causality until the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative lens functions well, building pressure through the ritual construction rather than external plot turns. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the destruction of the art reaffirms the artist's purpose—lands with felt cost (the lost effort) and thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative flows smoothly to a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "magic fixes everything" causality—where the rope becomes seamless and regrets melt—lacks mechanical resistance or stakes. The connection between the punched card and the ancient rope relies on dream logic rather than established causal rules, softening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic consistent with a Situational/Textural drive lens, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible. However, the resolution relies on the environment dissolving in response to an internal epiphany, which bypasses causal friction and lowers the sense of earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's worldview—lands clearly. However, the central complication (decoding the tile) is elided ("For three nights"), and the "lock" mechanism feels convenient, reducing the sense of earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible under a situational/hybrid lens, but the resolution relies on a symbolic "magic therapy" logic where fixing the pin instantly heals the relationship. The closure lands, but the cost of "years unsaid" is stated rather than dramatized in the final beat, making the reconciliation feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path of magical success without setbacks or genuine cost; the ritual simply works because the plot requires it. The resolution—walking through a sky-door—is a "magic feather" ending that dissolves the central conflict (grief/loss) rather than resolving it through agency. Causality is soft, driven by dream-logic rather than tangible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from discovery to action to realization. The magical realism element (instant sprout) functions as a fable-like accelerator for the climax, fitting the tone well. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mender adopts the daughter's philosophy—lands with clear conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The surreal causal logic holds together well under an accumulative lens, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The transition from the bathroom epiphany to the orchard creates a cohesive narrative arc despite the dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "rescue mission" trope is subverted with precise causality, and the trade (name for entry) drives the climax logically. The closure—Elias becoming a "gap" himself—is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is coherent but linear, relying on the swatch as a master key that resolves obstacles without failure or adaptation. While the closure is legible, the lack of causal complications or setbacks flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is distinct (Conceptual Repricing supported by the wax seal artifact). However, the central confrontation relies on familiar "magic library" tropes, and the climax—merging by exhaling—feels physically soft, resolving the tension with a dream-like reset rather than a sharp causal snap.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    A clean Situational arc that lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift from storm to conversation recontextualizes the threat effectively. The resolution relies on the antagonists’ rapid acquiescence, which feels slightly convenient but fits the fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "lock-and-key" resolution—the prism mends itself upon contact—relies heavily on coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. The lack of a visible, felt cost or obstacle undermines the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the pivotal turn relies on a convenient supernatural intervention (the "offered" memory) rather than causal pressure. The resolution is a Conceptual Repricing, but it feels intellectually delivered rather than earned through the struggle of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on unearned causality where a single firework magically resolves a decade-long supernatural curse without complication or sacrifice. The closure is symmetric and tidy ("the world had been waiting"), lacking the requisite friction or cost to make the resolution felt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands effectively via a Resonant Reconfiguration; the transfer of the cicada shifts the weight of grief from the fisherman to the object, and the final dream sequence crystallizes the lingering cost. The narrative drive (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistent, using the grotto's atmosphere to pressure the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The three-inversion structure provides perfect causal escalation within the word count, leading to a decisive, earned closure. The transition from observation to action is well-paced, and the cost of leaving is felt in the father's final state.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear vignette describing a successful process rather than a causal plot with reversals or cost. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the passenger is healed by magical props without a decisive choice or trade-off from the protagonist. Closure is achieved through atmospheric assertion rather than earned structural change or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is solid, and closure is decisive. However, the climax relies on an unestablished property of the ruby flake (melting the throne), which functions as a convenient resolution rather than a logic-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a coherent lyric arc (Stasis → Intrusion → Release) with a legible ending under a situational lens. However, the resolution relies on a convenient magical shift—a door appearing where there wasn't one—which bypasses the "cost" of the threshold fading. The narrative compression (due to low word count) rushes the deepening phase, making the acceptance of the past feel abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative logic follows a coherent surrealist arc where conceptual weight literally translates to physical change. The closure is a strong example of Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist alters the rules of the engagement (unthreading the pressure) to secure a payout, landing with legible cost and thematic satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on "tutorial" letters to drive the plot, creating a linear fetch-quest structure (read letter -> do action). The causal link between striking a floorboard and the mirror appearing, then tuning the mirror to find a theorem, operates on dream logic rather than established ground rules. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the mechanics remain opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a static atmospheric opening to a decisive transformative act. The "unsnap" moment functions as a clear Decisive Change, altering both the protagonist's state and the reality of the setting. The logic is surreal (dream/alchemical), but the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the knight's trauma into performance—lands with visible cost and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, adhering to a clear Accumulative lens that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the mailing. Closure is solid, with Elias shifting from passive observer to active guardian. The research sequence ("By noon...") is a bit convenient, compressing the investigation without significant obstacles, which smooths the texture too much.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative builds a causal chain (the call, the decision) but skips the climax (the heist/fire) entirely, resolving via summary aftermath. The shift to an omniscient historical overview in the final section deflates the tension and explains the outcome rather than dramatizing the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The circular structure is effective, and the ending reconfigures the narrative into a loop of eternal vigilance (Earned Stasis). The "finding a note written by himself" beat is a familiar genre trope, but it successfully forces the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mythic structure is solid, moving clearly from the inciting discovery to the transformative closure. The "hush" and the arbor's reaction create a coherent causal logic, though the ease of her ascent reduces narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fable-like logic holds together, but the climax relies on a deus ex machina—the waterfall explicitly telling the protagonist the answer ("You’ve been collecting the wrong kind of time"). This reduces the causal weight of the protagonist's own agency in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the inciting discovery to a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's worldview. While the "coin answering" relies on a convenient magical response to propel the climax, the structural integrity of the scene remains solid and the ending lands with conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible. However, the climax hinges on a pun ("other snide") that, while solving the immediate puzzle, feels tonally lightweight and lowers the gravity of the resolution. The causality holds, but the obstacle yields too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative drive leans on a "guided tour" structure where the forest actively pulls the protagonist to the shrine, diminishing his agency in the inciting phase. The closure acts as a rapid thematic fix—the "body whole" outcome resolves the physical peril too cleanly given the severity of the established injuries ("carved into his ribs"). The ending satisfies the prompt’s philosophical arc but bypasses the necessary struggle and cost required to earn such total healing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where causality is loose (e.g., fitting a lens into a coat clasp triggers a lighting change across the market). While the sequence flows, the closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" that feels unearned due to the lack of prior mechanical rigor or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence: a horological tool found in a separate location (clocktower) perfectly fitting a specific crack in a circus ceiling. While the "seams not cracks" realization creates a strong closure effect (Resonant Reconfiguration), the reliance on a convenient "magic key" solution external to the setting weakens the causal satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where causality is asserted rather than dramatized; the connection between printing the page and the protagonist realizing he is the simulation is opaque. While the closure (dissolution) is decisive, it feels like a "soft reset" ending common to the genre rather than a consequence generated by the scene's specific mechanics. The inciting incident (frost) leads to the climax via a linear path with no complications.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scene is tightly constructed, with the storm and shard acting as clear causal drivers for the climax. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, altering the protagonist's relationship to the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and linear, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive closure event (the unwinding). The ending lands a Decisive Change that reshapes the world, fulfilling the "publishable" standard for structural integrity. The causality between the stone's hunger and Elias's action is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is robust, leading to a legible Decisive Change (burning the notes) and Conceptual Repricing (collecting silence) that satisfies the prompt's closure requirements. The transition from the magical phenomenon to the philosophical realization is swift but causally linked to the psychometry premise.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic where understanding history unlocks the path. The closure lands with a tangible cost—the loss of the slide and GPS—creating a distinct “before and after.” The magical causality (carving changes the wind) fits the fable mode but feels slightly convenient in its immediate resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative structure is functional and the closure is legible under a Situational lens, but the climax relies on a convenient, unexplained supernatural element (flowers inside the glass) to force the resolution. The "magic window" mechanic solves the central question without requiring active agency or ingenuity from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear inciting incident and closure via Conceptual Repricing (archiving vs. releasing). However, the climax relies on a reactive environment that resolves the threat too easily, making the causality of the antagonists' defeat feel external to the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal arc is solid, pivoting on the distinction between wishing and conception, and the closure is decisive with the restoration of the town. The "cost" is primarily the mental burden of "working memory," which is stated ("crucible") but feels slightly light on the page; the success comes smoothly once the method is understood.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts his role as a &quot;hinge.&quot; The closure is earned, with the final decision to listen carrying a felt cost of isolation and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight and the magic system ("decreasing entropy" via memory) is established early, serving as a functional mechanic rather than a deus ex machina. The closure is an excellent Resonant Reconfiguration; the transformation of the antagonist into a sapling permanently alters the board with legible conceptual cost. The narrative drive holds the Causal lens firmly from the inciting hatching to the final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal: preparation, discovery of the flaw, technical intervention, and successful test. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the corrected bell speaking true). The resolution feels slightly convenient—a quick reweaving fixes a critical system minutes before the storm—but it holds together logically.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path of validation where the climax (alarms blaring) is resolved by a magical healing of the lantern, removing any felt cost. The closure—leaving the station—feels like a reward rather than a price paid, weakening the causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fable-like structure works well, providing clear closure with the return of the rain and the restoration of the oasis. However, the turning point relies on external permission (the ghost pressing the glass) rather than a protagonist-driven causal shift, softening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) recontextualizes the silo effectively. However, the climax leans heavily on expository interiority to explain the mechanics of the "unraveling" rather than letting the action carry the weight of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a functional lyric arc, but the resolution relies heavily on a convenient coincidence (the kite falling) rather than character action. While the closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, it feels unearned because the external world aligns too perfectly with the internal state without generating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is efficient, moving clearly from the established conflict to a resolution that carries cost (Elira’s life, Tomas’s assumption of the burden). The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "heresy" becomes the new tradition. The time jumps are handled cleanly with section breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured with decisive closure (departure) and visible cost (the empty lab). The &quot;test&quot; at the terminal feels slightly low-pressure given the stakes, but the causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative flow is smooth under an Accumulative lens, but the closure relies on a summary time-jump ("Years later...") to validate the action rather than crystallizing the change in the scene's present moment. This "epilogue" approach weakens the immediate structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear Inciting Incident and Closure, but the middle section suffers from a lack of friction; Rook travels from A to B without encountering resistance or tactical setbacks. The "video game logic" of the key-leaf opening the door resolves the plot conveniently, though the final conceptual repricing ("garden war") offers a satisfying resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative moves clearly from observation to departure, but the causality relies on dream logic (the sketch causing the compass to react) rather than mechanical or character-driven necessity. The closure is legible, but the "magic key" resolution softens the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is legible, but the resolution relies on the antagonist's instant capitulation, which softens the causal chain. The "magic system" of the ending works on dream logic rather than established causality.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative suffers a severe causality break: the story establishes "pain" as the sole weakness of the antagonist, then resolves the climax by asserting "silence" is the "one thing" it cannot digest, without explaining the shift. This contradiction makes the resolution feel arbitrary rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the climax relies heavily on a *deus ex machina*: the specific book needed ("Shape of Home") literally falls at his feet to provide the solution. This convenient coincidence undercuts the protagonist's agency in solving the final puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from exile to integration through a specific task. However, the resolution relies on a "soft reset" mechanism where the tapestry and labyrinth magically absorb the weight of the past, reducing the causal density of the character's own actions in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal arc: the mechanics of the "echo" magic are established early, making the spire's destruction an earned consequence of Liora's action. The Inciting Incident (ritual start) leads logically to the Climax (carving the fissure), resulting in a Decisive Change closure that permanently alters the world state.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The urgent constraint of "three breaths left" is broken by a lengthy backstory block and a three-part soliloquy, disrupting the narrative clock. While the final conceptual repricing (surrender as healing) lands, the suspension of time during the climax weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (suicide/reunion) is a decisive change with visible cost. The causal link between the "cracked mirror" backstory and the specific mechanics of the cave feels loose, functioning more as atmospheric set-dressing than structural necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear success sequence where the protagonist’s intent translates instantly to results without significant complication or tactical setbacks. While the closure (Harkin’s acceptance) is legible, the lack of a "try-fail" cycle or visible cost flattens the causal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative functions as a well-composed vignette under a Situational lens, establishing a ritual and executing it. The closure (finding "raw solace") is tonally coherent but structurally soft; the story does not dramatize *why* this specific iteration of the routine triggers a breakthrough that years of identical nights did not, leaving the epiphany relying on authorial assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is decisive and resonant (burying the eye), earning the Renunciation beat with a visible, irreversible cost. The causal chain from the virus’s nature to the specific method of occlusion (truffle paste) is tight, and the "reveal" of the eye's true danger logically motivates the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative momentum is stalled by a substantial summary block ("Elias had spent the last seventy-two hours investigating...") that distances the reader from the immediate scene. This reliance on retrospective telling rather than active dramatization flattens the inciting pressure. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the structural sag in the middle weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative drive is strong, utilizing the rising water to force a decisional crisis at the fissure that feels earned. While the "doorway of decisions" leans heavily on fable logic, the closure—a decisive change of trajectory—lands with the legible cost of abandoning his previous life and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is clean and linear, moving strictly from the inciting dream to the climb and final transformation. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen's state is irrevocably altered with a visible cost (loss of humanity), holding the drive lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is coherent as a vignette, leading to a legible Conceptual Repricing at the closure. However, causality follows dream logic—the shell transforming into a "key" and the boots gaining light happens by metaphorical fiat rather than earned mechanical or causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative operates on a cohesive dream-logic where destroying the record alters the reality (the empty grave). The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the physical act of burning the scroll pays off the setup of the "lie" about soaring, transforming it into a truth. The time-loop mechanics are communicated clearly without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable vignette structure: entry, problem presentation, wisdom dispensation, exit. While the orientation is clear, the scene lacks causal tension; the woman accepts Elias's interpretation immediately, removing any narrative friction. The closure is a "Conceptual Repricing," but it feels unearned because the preceding pressure was minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is coherent with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, but causality is soft. The magic system solves the central problem without a concrete mechanical cost or logical mechanism beyond symbolic association (rune healing the scar).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear, and the "current" functions well as a catalyst for the necessary emotional confrontation within the scene. However, the use of parenthetical flash-forwards at the end ("Later, when the city asked...") diffuses the immediate power of the closure beat, explaining the aftermath rather than letting the image of the planting stand on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from investigation to a decisive act of closure (tearing the dictionary) that resets the world. The causality follows a dream-logic consistent with the genre, and the ending delivers a clear Decisive Change. The link between the "spiral arbitration" and the dictionary as an anchor is established well enough to make the climax satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain where the protagonist's specific action (counting/winding) directly triggers the anomaly's escalation. Closure is excellent; the physical manifestation of the cost—the notch in the key—anchors the metaphysical experience in reality. The reversal where the clock turns the key, rather than the inverse, effectively dramatizes the loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear path, but the closure relies on a symbolic gesture that neatly cures the protagonist's trauma without a commensurate cost. The link between the laser pulse and the cessation of grief is thematic rather than causal, weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative moves cleanly through a linear arc with a clear closure unit (Decisive Change). However, the causality relies on "instruction manual" plotting (the scrawls dictate the next move), which reduces protagonist agency until the final decision to "not choose." The closure is legible, but the mechanics of the lantern feel convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.6)
    The vignette structure is coherent and the ritual logic holds, but the closure relies on a soft reset ("Try again tomorrow") rather than a decisive change in knowledge or stakes. The lack of visible cost to the protagonist limits the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is a coherent, linear vignette with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the covenant breathes). However, the narrative lacks causal tension; the ritual proceeds without obstruction or surprise, making the outcome feel inevitable from the start. Orientation and pacing are handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from arrival to investigation to revelation and departure with clear causality. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the nature of the "cure" is repriced, though the ease of the protagonist's acceptance lowers the dramatic tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, relying on a convenient celestial event ("constellations paused") to enable the resolution rather than protagonist agency. The discovery of the bone feels arbitrary—a prop inserted to force an epiphany rather than a causal result of the dowsing logic. The ending explains its meaning ("stillpoint had never been the end") rather than letting the structural change speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (deciding to plant again), effectively tying the backstory to the future. However, the climax relies on a deus ex machina mechanism where the universe/pen literally writes the thematic realization ("The seeds were never wrong") for the protagonist, bypassing the need for him to actively solve the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic arc (Acculumative/Situational) with a clear beginning and end. However, the climax relies on "magic system" opacity (signing "now," the camera flashing "truly") rather than causal logic, and the resolution comes easily with a symbolic rather than visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the narrative arc is complete and ends with a Decisive Change (burning the ledger), the causal logic of the "clues left for himself" is muddled. The story claims the "vandalized self-portrait" is a map, yet the actual instruction ("Find the third pillar") comes from the tapestry's border text, creating a disconnect between the prop and its function. The backstory logic—burning libraries to save a promise, then realizing the burning was the promise—feels circular and abstract rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the protagonist decides to act and immediately succeeds, lacking a complication that forces adaptation. The climax relies on a convenient mechanism (drumming the water) that resolves the central conflict without a legible cost or trade-off, resulting in a soft reset where the problem simply dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the transition from the climax ("stepped through") to the resolution ("Back in his bunk") acts as a soft reset, dissipating tension without explaining the spatial logic or cost of the exit. The "challenge" inciting incident feels staged to prompt the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on a "magical fix" (the mirror's reflection) to resolve the central conflict, bypassing character agency. The epilogue (the father finding the mirror) breaks the single-scene tension and resolves the ambiguity too neatly, reducing the story's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative violates the short story scope by presenting a summary montage of a week ("By dawn," "On the seventh day," "The next morning") rather than a dramatized scene. The resolution is unearned; the conflict dissolves via a magical deus ex machina (singing filings) followed by an off-stage bureaucratic capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is solid, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing (the island was a cage). The causality of the scrimshaw acting as a key is legible. However, the pacing is rushed, skipping the deepening phase of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing a Situational/Accumulative lens that effectively builds tension through the intrusion of the happiness tin. Closure is distinct and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration), with the burning of the tin and the sharing of the wood marking a clear, costly shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (the "unfolding"). The causality is consistent with the established magic system, though the progression feels frictionless, lacking the distinct "because/therefore" setbacks that heighten narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scene is coherent and legible, but causality is soft; the "barter" with the old woman resolves via convenient arrival rather than active negotiation or pressure in the moment. The closure feels like "symmetric satisfaction"—a pleasant, frictionless affirmation of connection without the "meaningful tightening" or visible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible before/after state via the transformation of the lens into the bell. However, the pivotal transition ("The next morning") elides the actual journey "deeper in," skipping the dramatization of the climax in favor of a summary aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from stasis to action via a clear inciting incident (the crane). However, the timeline of the crane's discovery on exposed steps is convenient, and the ending dissolves into a summary montage ("By winter...") that rushes the resolution instead of dramatizing the final connection.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure is clean, functioning as a tight consultation scene with a clear inciting incident (visitor arrives) and a conceptual closure. The pacing is steady, though the "action" is largely internalized or metaphorical, relying heavily on the strength of the dialogue and imagery to sustain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.5)
    A significant logical contradiction undermines the plot: the protagonist claims to have "no key, no ritual," yet immediately follows the "way the old texts described" to perform a specific ritual action. The resolution feels unearned as she enters with the solution and executes it without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the shadow trade) qualifies as a Decisive Change with visible cost. However, the reliance on the video archive beat to deliver exposition slows the middle section, telling us about the shadow's nature rather than dramatizing it in the present moment. The orientation within the library is solid, and the causality holds, though the path to the ending is linear and lacks complication.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative structure (Track B Mosaic via "layers") is legible, but the timeline creates a logic break. The sequence implies Elias applies salve, visits the market, and writes letters all within a single night ("mist began to lift"), yet the chameleon's tail shows "new growth" by morning—a biological impossibility that clashes with the story's grounded realism ("real medicine" vs. "enchanted charms").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the narrative arc is lucid and the "tunneling" conclusion resonates, the plot relies on a significant convenience: the archive door opens and the specific file slides out on its own. This passive acquisition of the central clue undermines the protagonist's causal agency, resolving the search phase through supernatural coincidence rather than effort.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, moving from sensory investigation to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. While the "spatial gaps" logic functions as a convenient bridge rather than a rigorous causal link, the final action of turning off the projector lands the ending effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear progression of convenience with no causal friction; the protagonist has the exact tool and method required to succeed immediately. Closure fails the cost requirement: the "stardust in her veins" functions as a reward rather than a price, and the resolution ("paintings sold for fortunes") is purely additive.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative moves clearly from discovery to resolution, providing a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the causality relies on "dream logic"—winding a clock magically restores the ecosystem—which asserts the solution rather than earning it through narrative mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the closure is structurally sound (a renunciation of the gear), the climax relies on a passive dream sequence to resolve the central question. The causal chain is weak; the protagonist listens, and the story simply delivers the answer via vision without requiring an active forcing move.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the inciting discovery to a decisive act of renunciation (discarding the punch). The pacing supports the "situational" lens, though the resolution comes with relatively low friction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from the discovery of the bolt to a resonant, decisive closure. The internal logic of the fable holds firm, and the final beat delivers a profound, earned change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from the inciting warnings to the decisive act of sundering. The closure is clear and resonant—a Decisive Change in the world state. The connection between the "sacrifice" (speaking the name) and the mechanical breaking of the scepter operates on poetic logic which fits the tone, though it slightly softens the hard causal linkage required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain to a decisive closure where the protagonist abandons her station. However, the specific mechanic of assembling three items to "unlock" the road feels slightly gamified and convenient. The shift from scientific observation to magical realism is smoothed by the orientation, but the "puzzle-solving" causality creates a minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.7)
    The resolution relies on a deus ex machina (magic stones fixing morale and engines) and a coincidental arrival of the scout, breaking causality. The ending lacks an earned cost; the rebellion is saved by an external force rather than the protagonist's agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on the convenient discovery of the kite (backstory coincidence) to drive the plot. The closure fails to enact a felt cost; the conflict dissolves via a "magic fix" where opposition evaporates instantly, resulting in symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the release of the photo and the return to pruning mark a decisive shift in stance with visible emotional cost. The pacing is controlled, moving from internal stasis to external friction (the tourists) and back to a changed internal state. The drive lens (Accumulative/Situational) holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that works for the genre, but the pivotal moment—redesigning the box—is summarized ("hands moved without thought") rather than dramatized. This creates a causal gap where the solution feels effortless despite the crushing external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    The scene flows with clear focus, and the closure (stepping through the portal) acts as a decisive change. However, the central epiphany—deducing that the thief is "repairing" time based solely on a "spiral with a broken center"—is a significant causal leap that strains credibility. The mechanism of the ink is functional but relies on asserted knowledge ("Kael knew it was the key") rather than demonstrated discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and creates a clear Decisive Change with fatal cost. However, the resolution relies on convenient "hacker magic" where dormant networks instantly override secure systems, and the pacing accelerates too rapidly into the climax without earning the systemic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    The situational lens holds firmly, delivering a clean moment of Earned Stasis. The causal loop is elegant: the sandbag that cracked the dome is repurposed to support life, physically manifesting the theme of repair within the scene's window.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    A masterfully structured causal arc. The inciting incident (sleepwalking stars) leads directly to a specific, cost-laden intervention (voicing silence). Closure is definitive: the acceptance of the "hungry" dark is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels inevitable yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a severe *deus ex machina*—the caretaker announcing a visitor with the crucial evidence—to resolve the central conflict immediately after the investigation begins. This coincidence breaks the causal chain and robs the story of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from an attempt to silence memory to a necessary confrontation with it. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the "debt" of witnessing—lands with clear emotional logic, though the mechanics of the "folding time" sequence feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident (the flake) and a resonant closure that reconfigures the village's relationship to memory. The narrative arc is coherent, though the causality is driven more by the magical object's instructions than organic progression.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure image lands, but the causal chain relies on thematic convenience rather than psychological realism. The resolution hinges on a "speech act" where the antagonist yields immediately to a moral argument, bypassing the necessary struggle that gives a climax its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative achieves closure through a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the mechanism—orchard magic triggered by a timeline pull—is soft and convenient. The resolution relies on a mystical vision that dissolves the central conflict instantly, bypassing necessary causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with legible closure, but the causality relies heavily on the convenient, intuitive function of the sliver ("sudden knowledge") rather than the protagonist's active problem-solving. The transition from the real world to the portal feels smooth but lacks a palpable cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is a linear discovery rather than a causal chain of pressure and consequence. The protagonist enters, observes, and succeeds in communion without a significant reversal or obstacle testing their resolve. Closure lands as a "Charged Poise" (committing to the map), but without a demonstrated cost or risk, the resolution feels convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the climax hinges on a *deus ex machina*: the ledger solves the puzzle automatically once the button is found, bypassing the protagonist's effort. The closure—time flowing backward—resolves the crisis without a clearly dramatized cost or consequence for Elias, making the victory feel too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving causally from the inciting message to a decisive closure (leaving the pillbox). The "ledger" metaphor effectively bridges the backstory and the present action. Orientation is immediate and grounded. The closure lands with a clear renunciation of her hiding place, satisfying the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is legible and resonant, but the climax suffers from split agency: the coachman spends years "learning to listen," yet the decisive moment is triggered by a burning parchment. This redundancy weakens the causal link between his skill and the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is severely damaged by "physics amnesia" regarding the pottery process; firing a damp bowl in a kiln within hours would cause it to explode, breaking the story's internal reality. The narrative relies on convenient summaries ("By evening... the bowl would emerge") to bypass necessary obstacles, resulting in a low-stakes linear progression without a genuine turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and tight, utilizing a Hybrid Accumulative lens where the exchange of the gauge tooth creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure feels earned, though the final image of the "open door" leans heavily on the metaphor established earlier rather than a concrete physical change.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on a "magic library" trope where the environment manifests the exact answer the protagonist needs (*On the Independence of Forgotten Things*) at the climax. This removes the burden of discovery from the character and resolves the central mystery with a convenient prop, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (shifting from ghostwriting for others to writing for herself) is sound. However, the coda—a dream sequence where a physical object manifests from a dream—blurs the reality established in the main scene, creating a late-stage genre ambiguity that softens the impact of the bridge scene.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is legible, with Liora's interference directly impacting the campus environment and the signal's response. The closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting her role from observer to participant, though the mechanism of the signal affecting arguments is asserted rather than demonstrated until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct inciting incident, rising action, and decisive climax. The mechanism of the final test—the compass turning on him—is resolved abruptly via symbolic logic (stabbing the table) rather than mechanical setup, but the resulting closure (Rewriting/Freeing the city) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the goal shifts from justice to witness. While the "lance" functions as a highly efficient tool that bypasses investigative friction, the emotional logic of the closure remains sound and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The plot follows a coherent Causal line from the inciting discovery to the climax at the window, holding the lens well. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (burning the evidence while internally reframing the sky), though the climax relies on the storm conveniently shattering the glass (situational) rather than a purely agency-driven exit.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative moves linearly from observation to departure without causal friction; the obstacles are nonexistent as the world cooperates (inviting wind, answering mountain). While the closure acts as a Decisive Change, the lack of prior resistance makes the breakthrough feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, gathering observations that lead to a coherent Conceptual Repricing of his father's legacy (spirals vs. circles). Closure is legible and meaningful, though the inciting pressure is low, making the movement feel more like a guided tour than a forced confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a *deus ex machina*—the star literally speaking to explain the theme—breaking the causal chain. The resolution (the ledger filling itself, the telegram dissolving) happens *to* Elias, rather than resulting from his actions, weakening the closure's earned impact.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive lens, moving from the planting of the seed to the extraction of the truth. Closure is achieved through a strong Conceptual Repricing: the lake is revealed as an archive of choices rather than a predator, and Eldrin's decision to "let the silence win" creates a resonant, costly stillness. The ending feels inevitable yet recontextualizes the inciting mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent portal-quest loop with a legible inciting incident and resolution; the return to the start with the transformed object provides structural closure. However, the climax relies on a static vision rather than an active choice to resolve the central tension, making the protagonist's agency feel secondary to the environment's script.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is strong, moving from the inciting ritual to a decisive closure. The specific cost paid—the erasure of the child's name—creates a valid Conceptual Repricing that feels earned and permanent, satisfying the closure requirement under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative relies on a high-magnitude coincidence—Liam finding a scrap from his own obscure band in a random storage unit—which strains credibility in a realist frame. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the path to it feels gifted by luck rather than driven by inevitable causality.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain from translation to climb to ritual is clear and compelling. The closure offers a distinct "Conceptual Repricing" of death as "reestablishing" rather than undoing. The precise mechanics of his "going back" at the end retain a slight, perhaps intentional, ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clean Situational/Accumulative arc, utilizing the "lost tomorrow" constraint to frame the encounter effectively. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—the realization that the woman belongs to the creel recontextualizes the entire exchange. The "three weeks since tomorrow vanished" rule is established early and pays off in the smelting of the "first second" of tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery path that relies on dream logic rather than causal friction; the protagonist faces no genuine resistance from the environment or the "higher-ups." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transcendence), but because the "walls" dissolve via magical epiphany rather than effort or sacrifice, the ending lacks weight.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the stasis of the station to the active journey and resolution at the bridge. The graffiti functions effectively as a causal driver, guiding the protagonist’s physical movements and framing the final closure choice without feeling overly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the watch's mechanics to create a clear inciting incident and climax. The transition from the dream-logic library to the waking world is swift but functionally legible. Closure is definitive, satisfying the causal chain established by the watch's limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal arc is flawless under the Causal lens; the inciting arrival leads directly to the climax via established constraints. Closure is a textbook Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the smashing of the violin irreversibly alters the world state and the protagonist's status with visible, accepted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear vignette that moves smoothly from inciting action to resolution. However, causality is low-friction; the chip functions essentially as a magic key without complication or risk of failure, resulting in a predictable sequence. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of obstacle softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is strong, moving from a clear inciting desire to a mythical climax and a resonant resolution. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maren returns to her labor with changed understanding—lands with weight. The transition from the grotto to the village square is swift, relying on fable-logic compression, but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is strong, with the altered lighthouse signal serving as a perfect objective correlative for the internal change. However, the sudden physical manifestation of the metaphorical cloak in the sand relies on unexplained dream-logic that weakens the causal chain of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The situational/lyric structure works well, using the meditation as a frame for memory and insight. The ending lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration regarding the nature of the lesson, though the sudden awareness of a student &quot;somewhere&quot; watching feels like a convenient bridge to closure rather than an inevitability earned by the scene's prior isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear path with a legible closing shift in status (becoming the anchor). However, the resolution relies on "whispering old words" and a convenient magical effect rather than active problem-solving or a causal turn derived from the protagonist's ingenuity. The victory feels unearned by the narrative setup.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear causal chain leading to a resonant closure. The transition via "mist walking" speeds the return but fits the established logic of forgotten magic. The ending serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Marlin recontextualizes his failure as a form of mastery, effectively paying off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative moves through a clear causal chain with dream logic that fits the genre well. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the world is perceived differently. However, the mechanism of the "frozen time" resolution feels slightly deus ex machina, resolved by the figure's instruction rather than the protagonist's ingenuity alone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing the "coins as mirrors" mechanism to drive the resolution. The ending lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "soft reset" (where she returns whole and the others wake up) mitigates the felt cost of the sacrifice, leaning on a "magical fix" trope rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the inciting discovery to the ritual and its consequences. The closure is a valid Decisive Change (monsters released, world altered) with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the reaper's status (now hunted). The causality of the magic system is consistent within the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with minimal complication; Elias applies a theory, and it works almost immediately. The closure lands on a resonant image, but the lack of on-page setbacks makes the resolution feel convenient rather than conquered. The connection between the dripping rates and the cosmic cure is asserted rather than proven through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The inciting incident (the chime's silence) acts as a symbolic rather than causal trigger, making the sudden decision to alter a twenty-year habit feel unmoored. The closure lands via a convenient hallucination ("saw it... whole") that bypasses the necessary struggle to earn the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative is a linear ritual sequence lacking causal friction or unexpected obstacles; the reliance on symbolic logic (starlings revealing the method) removes tactical difficulty. The climax happens *to* the character rather than resulting from a hard-won decision in the face of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear execution of a task with no significant on-page obstacles or reversals; the "fail-safes" are mentioned but never tested. While the closure works as a completed mission, the lack of causal complication flattens the arc into a vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is achieved via a Decisive Change (the merge), but the external resolution—the Emperor's banners burning and history stopping its rewrite—lacks causal logic. The internal ritual magically fixes the macro-political threat without a localized mechanism, resulting in an unearned "symmetric satisfaction" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mosaic structure effectively spans the six-month timeline, creating a coherent narrative arc. However, the pivotal consequence—the cessation of business—is handled in brief summary ("Business slowed. Then it stopped"), which robs the climax of dramatized weight. The closure is resonant, but the reliance on montage for the final act creates a sense of synopsis rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is resonant, utilizing a valid Reconfiguration of the protagonist's role. However, the climax relies on the leaf blower breaking down (coincidence) rather than Elias making an active choice to stop, which softens the causal chain and agency at the deciding moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a high-impact Conceptual Repricing where the reality is revealed as a text/story that Lyssa chooses to close. The causality holds under a Situational lens; the arrival of the Figure and the return of the pendant logically trigger the "unraveling" established by the "thinning walls" setup. The cost—the dissolution of her world and self—is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc to a Decisive Change, but the resolution lacks the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands; the protagonist heals himself and the antagonists simply flee. The climax relies on a high-risk gamble that pays off with total victory, smoothing over potential narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic that successfully transitions into a "Conceptual Repricing" closure where gravity becomes an assumption. However, the causal leap to physical flight feels slightly abrupt, relying heavily on the surreal premise rather than earned momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and the mechanics of the world are legible, but the resolution relies on a convenient magical ritual that fixes the problem without a clearly defined cost or consequence for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, utilizing an Accumulative lens that builds pressure through the construction of the illusion toward the inevitable eruption. The cyclical closure (the reset implied by "Again?") works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis, reinforcing the Sisyphean nature of his art. Causality is clean and the transition from construction to dissolution is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative structure is competent, but the reliance on a summary epilogue ("By the time the aliens returned") diffuses the tension of the scene, replacing a dramatized resolution with a montage. While the conceptual repricing of the horizon works, the closure lacks a felt, on-page cost, making the breakthrough feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.0)
    The scene is structurally sound and linear, delivering a clear closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the central twist relies on the "smudged face" trope to withhold information artificially, and the causality of the mist/glove mechanic is dream-logic rather than defined.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, following a clear descent-discovery-return structure under a Situational lens. The mechanism of the "phase seam" relies on dream logic rather than established causality, and the escape feels slightly too easy given the buildup, but the closure (a vow to return) lands as a legible Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc moves cleanly from isolation to communion, and the closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of her identity. However, the physical softening of the shard blurs the line between metaphor and reality a bit too abruptly for the established physical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the extended denouement ("Some say... Others say...") dissipates the climax's impact, drifting into a summary-style fade-out that weakens the closure. The "why now" factor is thin; the catastrophe feels like an inevitable fable outcome rather than the result of a specific, unique error in this attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The multi-shard structure (discovery, nightfall, aftermath) is legible and effectively builds mythic weight, satisfying Track B requirements. The closure is decisive and costly, transforming the protagonist ontologically in a way that feels earned by the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the protagonist succeeds without encountering genuine resistance or paying a cost; the statues "melt" instantly upon hearing the music, rendering the conflict trivial. The physical logistics of playing a violin while pressing a shell to one's chest are confusing and break causal immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative establishes strict rules for the drone threat (motion-tracking, specific gaps) but discards them at closure ("walked straight through") for a thematic exit, breaking causal consistency. The detour to the "haunted" post office feels like a convenient workaround rather than a solution driven by the protagonist's ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative operates on dream logic, which fits the tone, but the transition via the "wrong turn" feels convenient rather than causal. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of silence—is legible, though the arrival there lacks significant narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to ritual to resolution. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (he becomes a "crease"), but the causality relies on "magic system" mechanics that function without resistance or unexpected cost, lowering the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on vague dream logic that obscures causality. The mechanism of the "Stay" command—and why it results in the dream vanishing from the beach but remaining in the photo—is unclear. The closure feels thematically disconnected from the physical action of filing the photograph away.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear situational arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) at the end, recontextualizing the lock as protection rather than prison. However, the antagonist (the man) vanishing instantly upon her realization removes the potential for external consequence, leaving the closure feeling slightly soft and reliant on dream logic rather than causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving seamlessly from discovery to realization to confrontation. The closure (Decisive Change) is powerful, with the restoration of the stars and memory carrying a tangible, heavy cost. The mechanism of the pedestal feels slightly convenient, but the structural integrity of the ending is high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative structure is tight and efficient, moving cleanly from atmospheric setup to the inciting shadow-pulse and resolution. The concept of "reversible exile" provides a satisfying causal logic for the climax, where the abstract magic becomes concrete action. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo, effectively signaling Kael's entry into a more dangerous world.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear fable logic with legible transitions between the layers of reality. However, the protagonist's disappearance—the ultimate cost of the exchange—occurs off-page via a time-jump ("By dawn, he was gone"), which softens the causal impact of the climax and leans on convenient myth-making rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure—unraveling the net knot by knot—perfectly matches the narrative drive. Closure is decisive and resonant: the physical shattering of the prisms and the release of the spirits mark an irreversible state change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, successfully executing a Conceptual Repricing (map as boundary → map as key). While the closure is legible, the "cost" is abstract—the rejection of Guild rules—rather than viscerally felt on the page. The leap from film overlay to the map glowing feels slightly convenient, bypassing causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational line: discovery leads to anomaly, which forces a stance crystallization (the lie). Closure is excellent, with the decision to suppress the finding acting as a Decisive Change carrying a legible emotional weight ("sediment"). Causality holds firm, integrating the supernatural element without breaking the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight; the "ghost" responds directly to the encoded provocations, leading to a clear climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the immediate threat is silenced, but the ending image of the child implies a cyclical cost. The "server room" metaphor effectively bridges the magical and technical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The elevator structure provides a functional pacing mechanic, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the spire from prison to lens) works logically. However, the climax relies on the convenient instruction "Look up" and a coincidental break in the weather rather than earned deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on a literal Deus Ex Machina—a thread of light that physically saves the protagonist from a fatal fall—which breaks the established realist/scientific frame without earning the genre shift. The closure is a "Realization" ending with zero cost; Elias gains safety and enlightenment without sacrificing anything or making a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, but the central action beat—constructing a complex glass ceiling in a tree hollow overnight—strains verisimilitude. The logistics of sourcing and installing glass panes in a demolition zone are glossed over, creating a "dream logic" gap in an otherwise grounded causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution relies on unearned "dream logic" (hopscotch repairs engines) and extreme coincidence (the phrasebook map) rather than causal progression. The ending lacks a Decisive Change with visible cost; the problem simply vanishes when the pattern is performed.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from diagnosis to repair to resolution with a legible drive lens (Hybrid Causal/Symbolic). The closure is definitive—the world unlocks—but the causality is somewhat dream-logic (fixing the mirror summons the child). The conceptual repricing at the end ("shape of time's absence") is strong, though the physical mechanism of the climax (the water "didn't resist") lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a sweeping summary bridge ("For weeks...") to resolve the central problem, bypassing the necessary scene work of building community. This summary mode undercuts the causality of the ending, making the "nebula" feel like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned result.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and circular, successfully landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clock’s purpose transforms. The inciting incident (the clock "coughing up" a specific symbolic object) functions as a *deus ex machina*, which is acceptable in a fable but limits the sense of causal inevitability. The closure is strong, with a clear conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story relies heavily on a flashback structure (saving the girl) to generate interest, turning the present narrative frame into a lower-stakes aftermath. While the transition is legible, the timeline removes the protagonist from the immediate danger, reducing the ending to a reflective coda rather than a dramatized climax.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to a decisive act of release (Decisive Change) that earns the Resonant Reconfiguration of his worldview. The arrival of the child near the end acts as a thematic mirror rather than a deus ex machina, confirming rather than solving the arc. The pacing is efficient, though the realization beat is dense with internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative structure is a linear transaction lacking causal friction; the request is made, understood, and fulfilled without complication or risk of failure. The closure (Liora waiting for the next customer) is a soft reset that relies on the "bottled moonlight" as a token of exchange rather than a consequence that visibly reconfigures the protagonist's status or options.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure (relief/cleansing) is legible and thematically coherent. The structure is linear and lacks a significant complication or twist; the resolution comes too easily, with the hard work ("sandpapering") having occurred off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on fable logic where a physical token (the weight) and index cards instantly resolve deep-seated ethnic tensions ("thirty years of grudges") overnight. This rapid, frictionless resolution undercuts the narrative weight of the conflict, resulting in a tidy ending that feels unearned. Causality is present but simplistic; the transition from discord to harmony lacks a necessary middle beat of struggle or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from physical manipulation of the mirror to a metaphysical realization. Causality follows the story's established soft sci-fi logic. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts the entanglement—lands effectively with the cost of losing her solitary self.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution: failing to grab the seed in the grotto but extracting it later by burning the paper is a causal disconnect that unearths the reward without an established mechanic. While the closure (planting the seed) is thematically resonant, the logic bridging the climax to the resolution is convenient dream-logic rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is effective, building resonance to a clear closure point. The decision to leave the valuable insulator behind serves as a legibly costly Renunciation (Earned Stasis), reweighting the character's values from survival utility to artistic offering.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    The climax relies on the external magic of the nexus ("aligning them into a pattern") rather than a decisive protagonist choice with paid cost. The narrative is a low-stakes encounter that resolves through atmospheric shift rather than causal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the coda provides a decisive change in status (opening the shop). However, the primary obstacle (the locked diary) yields too easily to the device, reducing the causal weight of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative builds well but fails at closure due to a "soft reset" where the theft has no consequences and the vault is simply left unlocked. The causal link between Liora showing her doodles and the Elders’ complete forgiveness is tenuous, lacking necessary friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear quest structure, but the causality relies on unexplained magic (the arrow tip crumbling "purpose fulfilled") rather than logical progression. The closure arrives via the acquisition of a superpower (moss infection) rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice, resulting in a low-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from investigation to realization to escape. The closure (writing "Listen") effectively acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, marking a permanent shift in her methodology from data collection to primal wariness.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear 1-2-3 escalation (three chimes) with immediate success at each step, lacking a "try/fail" cycle or complication to generate tension. While the causality is clear—ringing the bells frees the aurora—the victory feels unearned due to the absence of active on-page resistance or unforeseen costs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias abandons his post—is legible and carries the cost of his identity ("They would not know his name"). However, the plot relies on the driftwood magically rearranging itself to direct him, which diminishes his agency at the pivotal moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight Accumulative/Textural lens that resolves into a powerful Conceptual Repricing: Elias realizes he is the medium, not the maker. The causality of the magical elements (stars, halo, press) follows a consistent internal logic, and the closure—where the vanishing stars are revealed as an invitation rather than an erasure—recontextualizes the entire plot. The ending feels inevitable yet surprising, satisfying the 9+ closure standard.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent but relies heavily on the "guide figure" to explain the magic and resolve the conflict. The shift from physical magic (vines, bridges) to meta-fictional magic (seeds turning into "stories") at the climax blurs the established rules for thematic convenience. Closure is achieved, but the protagonist's agency is secondary to the magical instruction he receives.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line: intent leads to ritual, ritual provokes a supernatural response, forcing a Decisive Change. The climax (shattering the prism) acts as a functional closure with a clear before/after state. The link between the car’s frost and the prism works well within the established genre logic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a convenient coincidence (finding the magic bead just as the thread runs out) to resolve the inciting obstacle, which weakens the causal chain. However, the closure lands with a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration where the lover receives the message and initiates a reciprocal act, validating the spinner's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" path where the solution (magic silk + touch) resolves the central problem instantly without complication. The "Years later" coda diffuses the immediate impact of the closure, creating a soft, summary-heavy ending rather than a resonant stop.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where a physical obstacle (the seam snapping shut) is resolved by a purely internal, abstract shift (closing eyes/smiling) without established rules. The antagonist introduced via the intercom provides no actual resistance, resulting in a low-stakes linear progression.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds to the closure of abandoning the skiff, a clear Decisive Change. However, the physical mechanics of the letters (appearing in crates Elias presumably loaded himself) rely on a fuzzy dream logic that slightly undermines the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    The "accidental prophecy" creates a massive causal promise ("next sunrise will be the last") that the cyclical "earned stasis" ending ignores; the narrative treats the prophecy as atmospheric flavor rather than a plot driver, leaving a significant loose thread at closure. The drive lens is Situational, but the causality of the climax is muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.4)
    The scope violates the short-story default, compressing weeks of travel and a life-changing journey into summary montage rather than a pressurized scene. The arrival of the guide is a convenient plot device that resolves the inciting uncertainty without cost. The reliance on synopsis-style narration ("The villagers gasped, then wept") distances the reader from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent accumulative arc, effectively moving from the inciting discovery to a legible closure. The pivot from the sextant’s memory to the sudden realization about trees feels associative and asserted rather than causally earned by the scene’s specific pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot follows a linear "ritual-to-success" path without significant setbacks or reversals. The arrival of the villagers ("They didn't ask... They knew") relies on convenience rather than earned causality, creating a "symmetric satisfaction" ending that lowers the sense of genuine difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid with a clear causal chain leading to a Decisive Change (leaving the library). Orientation is effective, and the closure lands with a legible shift in stance, though the resolution relies heavily on external guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("By morning," "By the third day") to bridge the inciting incident and climax, bypassing the necessary scene work of the struggle. The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" reset (the bakery simply returns) which erases the problem's weight rather than exacting a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magic tool" Deus Ex Machina; the lantern slide, established as a measuring device, conveniently projects a physical bridge at the climax without prior causal setup. While the library's collapse provides linear momentum, the resolution lacks a structural pivot derived from the protagonist's earlier skills or mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene has a clear arc, but the causal logic of the climax is convenient. It is unclear why the "tide" waits to punish Veyne for a past betrayal only after Lena tricks him in the present; the mechanism of justice serves the plot rather than internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the progression feels inevitable rather than caused by agentic choices under pressure. The "election" concept provides a clock but operates largely in the background until the convenient reveal that she was "chosen," removing the burden of active attainment from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is complete, but the resolution hinges on a convenient magical inheritance (paint tubes inside a rock) that resolves the conflict without a significant tactical struggle or cost. The causality shifts from grounded grief to dream-logic mid-scene, and the &quot;gift from the grave&quot; ending lowers the narrative tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a physical inciting incident to a decisive change in behavior. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias rejects the external validation of the Archive to integrate its practice into his daily life. The refusal of the second fragment cements the transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear structure that functions well as a vignette or prose poem but lacks a decisive narrative turn or complication. The accumulation of sensory details builds to a clear closure moment, yet the absence of an obstacle makes the progression feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a dramatized event.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structural arc is clean, utilizing the "controlled burn" as a decisive change that effectively bifurcates the timeline. However, the overnight regeneration of the roses ("By dawn... New roses pushed through") strains credulity even for bioengineered flora, reading as convenient symbolic timing rather than a coherent causal mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on unearned coincidence—the letter arriving in a rusted-shut mailbox exactly when the locket is found—without establishing a causal logic, even within a magical realist frame. The resolution, where the entire neighborhood fills the box with letters by noon, feels rushed and unmotivated by the preceding action. The bridge from the mystery of a missing girl to a community therapy session is abrupt and lacks dramatized steps.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the dice roll to the dance to the escape. The closure is decisive—flooding the lab and erasing the physical evidence—and the cost (leaving empty-handed but changed) is legible. The "dance as password" logic holds well within the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the "whale" timeframe providing excellent compression for the ritual. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist moves from seeking a specific memory to hunting the mechanism of storage itself, accepting the lethal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible as a vignette with a clear attempt at a Conceptual Repricing closure (scream to sigh). However, the "success through apparent failure" resolution relies on convenient magical physics rather than a causal link to the summoner's specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative loop creates a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration; the ending recontextualizes the opening "sugar" beat with chilling causality. The mosaic structure (Track B) effectively manages the passage of time, and the "trap" mechanism provides a distinct, earned closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure lands with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (she is captured, but the memory virus is released). However, the "resonance structures" function as a convenient, resistance-free magic system that solves the problem exactly as intended, reducing causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (unlinking the history) is structurally sound, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the inciting pressure (the guard/Emperor arrival) resolves through an unearned cooperative shift, weakening the causal chain between the threat and the resolution. The fable-logic holds, but the lack of resistance flattens the structural peak.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is solid, moving logically from the descent to the confrontation and resolution. The closure is strong—Veyra’s decision to discard the shell is an earned renunciation with clear thematic cost. The climax relies slightly on a rapid explanation of mechanics ("echoes weren't memories... they were answers") right when needed, but the setup holds.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (widow healed, Lena resigned) lands with resonant cost. However, the logic of the reveal—specifically why the widow would need to be told her child survived, or if she knew and simply ignored it to chase the ghost—relies on slightly ambiguous phrasing ("dreams had been showing her the wrong ghost") that creates a momentary stumble in causality.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "lesson" structure provides a clear beginning, middle, and end with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure (Liora picking up the whisk). However, the causality is linear and low-pressure, lacking the tight turns or costly trade-offs that create gripping momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative drive is strong, but the climax relies on a "vision dump" triggered by touch to explain the mystery, which bypasses active deduction. The closure is a decisive transformation, but the "You're next" radio tag shifts the ending toward pulp horror tropes, slightly undercutting the literary resonance of the "garden" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift from sealing the crack (defense) to feeding the glass (offense) works well to assert dominance. The causality of rejecting the voices only to immediately trigger their prophecy requires careful reading but holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The scene possesses a clear beginning, middle, and end with legible causality. However, the inciting incident (the child's arrival) and the resolution hinge on coincidence and external catalysis rather than the protagonist's active pursuit of a goal. The closure is distinct (Resonant Reconfiguration) but feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is strong, with the engineer's actions directly influencing the outcome. The closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation/buying time), though the shift from "bomb" to "stabilizing beam" relies heavily on asserted technobabble rather than established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent situational arc (waiting for the event), and the closure (the viaduct rising) is legible. However, the protagonist lacks causal agency—he observes the event rather than instigating it—and the resolution arrives without a visible or felt cost, reducing the ending to a predetermined arrival rather than an earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from investigation to realization and flight, but the climax hinges on the unmotivated lantern-smash. The conspiracy logic (flooding to erase history immediately post-drought) is thin but serviceable for the length. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (running to the archives), though the causal trigger for the wall's failure is muddled (impact vs. water pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid, leading to a legible Decisive Change where Elias moves from passivity to action. The structure effectively uses the repair process to mirror the internal arc, though the resolution feels slightly linear and predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative creates a tight, resonant loop where failure is recontextualized as data ("the first draft"), meeting the criteria for Conceptual Repricing. The destruction of the workshop serves as a Decisive Change, irreversibly altering her status while the drive lens (Accumulative/Iterative) holds firm. The causality of the workshop's collapse feels earned by the "conducting" frequency, merging plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" at closure. However, the mechanism of the numbers appearing in the physical world (frost, coffee cup) clashes with the established "neural lace"/server farm sci-fi reality without sufficient grounding, reading as a convenient genre shift to horror logic to force the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is a clean, coherent movement toward a state of Charged Poise. The closure—stepping forward while mirrors shatter—effectively dramatizes the internal decision, satisfying the requirement for a decisive change even within a preparatory scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    The plot relies heavily on coincidence to achieve closure, specifically the dog sniffing the heirloom and the convenient reinterpretation of the initials. This "message from the universe" acts as a deus ex machina that resolves the central conflict without requiring the protagonist to make a difficult, pressure-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    The inciting incident relies on a severe breach of physical credibility: a paper letter cannot survive five years of "harvest winds" and "damp earth" in an open vineyard to be found intact under a boot. This "magic object" causality break undermines the narrative foundation and the timeline's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a clean example of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, where the protagonist buys time against entropy with a visible conceptual cost. The causality is tight, with the interaction with the Voice serving as a necessary pressure to crystallize Lysan's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions with no causal pressure or resistance; the "healing" is asserted by the narrator rather than dramatized through struggle. Closure is a "mission accomplished" moment that feels unearned because no cost was paid and no risk was taken.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scene orientation is solid, but the climax relies on a coincidence: the woman enters exactly at the moment of breakthrough to provide global context ("It’s not just here"), which functions as an explanatory deus ex machina. The closure works conceptually but feels structurally convenient, reducing the protagonist's agency in the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and tightly structured, moving from a ritualistic search to a confrontational climax and a decisive resolution. The closure (breaking the arrows, leaving the chalk) functions as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, as Elias abandons his identity as the "finder."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative relies on poetic logic ("syncing" with a clock stabilizes a mountain) rather than established causal rules, making the resolution feel like a magical "soft reset." However, the closure—leaving the tools and the life behind—provides a legible Conceptual Repricing with an acknowledged cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scene flows linearly from the diagnosis (blood work) to the death, but lacks significant causal resistance. Mrs. Calloway’s hesitation is resolved instantly by the music, making the "flawless" outcome feel inevitable rather than earned. Closure lands via the vinyl release, a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the preceding lack of struggle lowers the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, with a clear causal chain from finding the key to opening the door. However, the term "The Spooning" (likely derived from a "spoons bend reality" prompt) creates a distracting tonal pothole that undermines the gravity of the event. The pacing is extremely staccato due to the line-by-line formatting, which prevents the accumulation of narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the causal chain (tooth to confrontation to bargain) is clear. The closure, however, lacks the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands. The resolution—trading wounds for stars and receiving the brother back "unmarked"—resolves the tension too neatly, effectively externalizing the price and leaving the protagonist largely unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is legible and the closure (passing the torch) works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the arrival of the child is a convenient coincidence that resolves the narrative need without active pursuit. The cost of giving up the stone is low, described with a smile rather than felt loss, making the "passing" feel easy rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with exceptional clarity via Resonant Reconfiguration; the physical exchange of the amber for the moss externalizes the internal shift. The pacing is tight, and the "bonfire to embers" causality holds perfectly under a Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a legible arc of surrender, but the resolution relies on a "magical fix" where the story rewrites itself once the author yields. The ending—a manuscript found with the author missing—is a genre cliché that resolves the plot without requiring the protagonist to navigate the consequences of his realization in the real world.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path of low resistance (problem identified, solution applied, immediate success) without meaningful complications or setbacks. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, as the "cost" of the remedy is nominal and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative procedural arc (preparation, ritual, success), and the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible. However, the progression is strictly linear; the climax fulfills the initial goal exactly as planned without a complicating turn or reweighting of options.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is significantly softened by the "Later, he would take the mechanism home" exposition, which removes the necessity of sacrifice and deflates the final image. The ending attempts to have it both ways—success in the cavern and future possession—ignoring the established dependency of the echoes on the cavern's specific architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear arc of escalation to a Conceptual Repricing (accepting the "loom" role). The closure lands with the cost of her eventual disappearance, recontextualizing the central conflict effectively, though the transition to the epilogue summary is slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a distinct closure unit (keeping the carving), but the causal link relies on a dream sequence to provide the solution rather than waking agency. Orientation and pacing are solid, though the brevity rushes the emotional pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a tactile inciting incident (the camera) to a surreal confrontation and a decisive closure event. The ending functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, locking the character into a cycle with a palpable sense of cost and inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure—repurposing the terminal as a bridge—is a strong Conceptual Repricing that lands with clear meaning. However, the mechanical plot hinge (a carnival sextant perfectly fitting a spaceport hydroponics valve) relies on convenient "dream logic" that strains the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the scribe fractures the status quo with visible cost (the broken floor). The transition to dream-logic—where scattered gears chime without assembly—fits the fable-like mode, though the causality is lyrical rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear choice (marsh vs. docks) and a decisive closure act (dropping the ledger). The causality at the climax is soft, relying on the sundial's sudden magical behavior ("pointed inward") to trigger the realization, but the structural closure lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic (discovery -> decoding -> ritual action), and the closure creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the harbor. However, the plot relies on a convenient revelation handed to the protagonist by the object rather than earned through varying tactics or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on a "magical" thread acting as a compass to conveniently locate the locket, which breaks the established reality's causal logic. While the closure (reframing the narrative) works conceptually, the mechanism to get there (divining the locket) is unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from preparation to action to a resonant closure via Conceptual Repricing. The ending successfully recontextualizes the "failure" (the mechanical bird) as a new, necessary form of beauty. The pacing supports the weight of the moment without dragging.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a convenient coincidence (the boy appearing exactly when needed) to trigger the protagonist's action, lacking causal groundwork. The resolution is immediate and low-cost; the wound is bound with thread already in hand, bypassing genuine struggle. Closure lands on a resonant image, but the path there feels constructed rather than earned by the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting image to the climax at the fountain. The reinterpretation of "sidereal patience" as decisive action rather than waiting is a satisfying causal pivot that earns the opening of the door. Closure lands firmly with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the city's state.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from the inciting problem (dying garden) to a decisive resolution (departure). The logic of the "cost" is slightly inverted; giving up the memory that the garden is a "cage" feels like removing a burden rather than paying a steep price to leave. The closure is distinct, but the lack of friction makes the journey feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing the "spectral mentorship" as a taught mechanism to resolve the inciting incident (the cracked stone) without breaking causality. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the concept of grief, though the linear progression feels slightly safe and the solution arrives a bit too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure tightly frames the specific moment of the pendulum's pause, effectively utilizing the prompt's timeframe. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where the clock's altered rhythm forces the village to confront its guilt, landing with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is excellent, using the three knots to escalate tension in a tight accumulative design that holds the Causal/Accumulative Hybrid lens perfectly. The closure—resetting the chessboard as a "Resonant Reconfiguration"—lands with clear conceptual cost and recontextualizes the opening image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of low resistance: arrival, process, success, departure. The ending lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the "numb fingers" are a physiological detail, not a price paid for altering reality. It reads as a vignette of competence rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear fable-like structure, and the Accumulative lens successfully builds the "magic of the dust" logic. However, the transition to the ending ("That night... By dawn") telescopes significant action into summary, bypassing the immediate tension of the raid to deliver the aftermath. This reduces the visceral cost of the climax, relying on a soft ellipsis rather than a dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece functions well as a situational vignette, using the rocking chair’s deceleration to frame the scene’s duration and create a natural closing beat. The closure—leaving the ephemeral work to dissolve—lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing of the artistic act, though the lack of external pressure limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative holds a clear Situational drive that resolves in a powerful Conceptual Repricing: his death proves the Archives' lie. The summary bridge ("spent the next week") dissipates scene tension slightly compared to a fully dramatized sequence, but the closure lands with undeniable impact and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative arc, gathering the remnants of the choir to a singular point of focus. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; they do not fix the music but find a new way to inhabit the silence ("listening to the cracks"). The transition from the backstory of conflict to the present stillness is smooth, though the vibrating rosette at the end risks a touch of unearned sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative breaks the single-scene container, dissolving into a summary montage ("By the time the Alignment passed...") that glosses over the actual conflict with critics and elders. This lowers the cost of the resolution, as the results are told in synopsis rather than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative flows logically, but the inciting object (the matchbox) is a convenient mystery gift found off-page, and the riddle offers no resistance, being solved instantly in thought. This creates a linear path with minimal causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on expository reflection to generate significance, stalling momentum in the middle. The climax hinges on an unearned external validator (the disembodied voice) and a "realization" paragraph that explains the resolution rather than dramatizing the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative drive is strong, utilizing a Situational-to-Causal lens where Liora deconstructs the intruder's mission to force a Decisive Change. The "three truths" structure ("first revelation," "second," "third") provides clear escalation but feels somewhat formulaic and list-like in such a short space. Closure is excellent, with the rising city and the repurposing of the poison offering a resonant, costly reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the dice mechanic to drive the climax and unlock the surreal logic of the sideways leap. Closure is excellent; the decision to close the door creates a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that recontextualizes the climb not as a prison, but as a valid choice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Lyric arc, moving from stasis to a moment of connection that triggers release. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the disappeared leaf, the return of sleep), though the causality is driven by magical logic rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure relies on synopsis-style leaps (e.g., "That morning," "That night," "That winter") that violate the single-scene scope required for this length. The resolution is unearned; shattering the lens triggers a utopian fix (bees return, bread is perfect) through "magical thinking" rather than causal on-page action, dissolving tension into a summary epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The surreal mechanics follow a consistent dream-logic that holds firm through the climax, creating a stable Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens. The closure—a decisive exit from reality—lands with the tangible cost of erasure, satisfying the requirement for a "meaningful tightening" of fate with an unambiguous final state.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a convenient prop (the dictionary found right on the table) to solve the central conflict, weakening the causal chain. While the surreal "dream logic" of the resolution fits the setting, the victory feels unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal trajectory where each strike elicits a specific, escalating response from the environment. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the relationship between man and storm is fundamentally altered from opposition to collaboration. The inciting incident (the blue hour's arrival) and climax (the sea's vocal response) are distinct and well-paced.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong, effectively linking the inciting shell-crack to the climax through the protagonist's expertise. Closure is decisive and legible, though the sudden disintegration of the whistle reads as a convenient magical disposal rather than an earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is functional, but the escape strains credibility; Elias slips away into shadows despite police proximity and a physical lunge from the antagonist. The "Parallels" reveal is a strong beat, but the lack of a realized cost for the escape softens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an atmospheric opening to a clear inciting incident (finding the note) and a resonant closure (the library exchange). The transition from the pavilion to the library is swift but effective, creating a cohesive accumulation of meaning. The closure successfully reconfigures his relationship to his work without forcing a false victory.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality relies on a leap of convenience: tilting a lamp to instantly reveal coordinates hidden in a stamp strains credibility. The narrative moves from discovery to resolution without significant obstacles; the lock opens easily, and the secret chamber is found without a struggle, reducing the earned sense of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is distinct and resonant, utilizing a Conceptual Repricing where "sinking" is recontextualized as "unfolding" into a new state. The causality is consistent within the story's dream logic; the placement of the gem acts as a clear trigger for the climax. The backstory of the detached shadow provides a functional ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is tight, with a clear drive lens linking the heist-like backstory to the present crisis. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist reframes her trauma with visible emotional cost, though the logistics of her transition from "finding coordinates" to "Subject 7" are slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on a soft reset of conflict; the pilgrim’s resistance evaporates instantly (“voice lacked conviction”) to facilitate the ending. While the mechanics of the drone and chip facilitate a causal chain, the emotional causality—friendship forged instantly after theft—lacks sufficient groundwork. The closure lands on a resonant image, but the path there feels paved by convenience rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (the decision to go) is a clear Decisive Change. However, the inciting incident for the resolution—driftwood spontaneously splitting to reveal a dry note—relies heavily on unestablished magical convenience or coincidence, which undercuts the gritty noir realism established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The resolution hinges on a high-coincidence sentimental trigger (the general's brother happened to carve a similar drawer) rather than an earned tactical maneuver. The logic of the trade is muddied by the dialogue ("information you already have?"), and the causal link between the drawer pull and the release of a prisoner is melodramatic and tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is solid with a legible Decisive Change (turning inland) that feels earned. The pivot from sea to land is causally linked to the internal pressure, and the closure—admitting lateness rather than being lost—provides a satisfying resolution to the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The closure unit is a decisive change, marked by the sacrifice of the baseball and the choice to "start." However, the mechanics of the timeline (the newspaper dates relative to the setting) and the convenient "parting of the water" rely heavily on dream logic rather than established causality. The transition from the collapsing tunnel to the city street feels slightly disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from inciting incident to escalation and resolution without wasted motion. The closure lands as a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora integrates the magic rather than wielding it, paying a conceptual price (her former humanity). The logic of the spice magic and the "thin veil" holds up well under the story's own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing a hybrid situational/causal lens where the magic ritual forces a decisive confrontation with the past. Closure is excellent; the "unfastening" serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the physical act of opening the satchel into a release of grief. The causality of the ritual—using ink to track lost time—is inventive and clearly established.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clear, driven by the "Try again" reveal which cleverly implies a time loop or accumulated effort. Closure is definitive and resonant ("Resonant Reconfiguration"), though the climax relies slightly on external assistance ("hands reaching") rather than a shift in Lien's own tactics, softening the agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and external forces (the tide pulling her, the prophecy appearing "accidentally") rather than character agency to drive the plot. While the closure is visually resonant, the causal chain is soft, dependent on convenient prompts rather than earned decisions. The resolution feels inevitable rather than the result of a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line from opportunity (blackout) to action (heist) to resolution (signal), with a legible decisive change at closure. However, the explanation for the blackout's timing—"spent months ensuring it wasn't [coincidence]"—is vague and convenient, bypassing the mechanics of the inciting incident. The closure lands a Charged Poise, but the progression feels inevitable rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central premise—a world stripped of friction—is immediately contradicted by the protagonist's ability to walk, crouch, and place stones without difficulty. This fundamental inconsistency in the story's physics breaks narrative causality and suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear build from the vigil to the release of the poem. However, the inciting mechanism—the darkroom timer "counting down from an hour he’d never set"—creates a causality break. Unless the story is supernatural (which isn't established), a mechanical timer ticking without being set confuses the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain of the duel revealing the code is strong, but the closure logic wobbles. Liora's line that the "lock's been broken for decades" undermines the mechanical necessity of the key they just spent the scene retrieving, turning the climax into a symbolic gesture that softens the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is legible as Earned Stasis (choosing to stay despite the urge to flee), and the scene holds together under an Accumulative lens. However, the turning point relies on a soft prop exchange that feels thematically convenient rather than causally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where "splicing film" conveniently solves the physical separation without established ground rules or cost. The ending creates a "happy reunion" that explicitly bypasses consequence ("above the rules of endings"), missing the required felt cost for literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is solid, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear change in status. However, the mechanism of the ending relies on a conceptual leap ("dreams were the island trying to remember her") that feels slightly convenient rather than causally rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Accumulative logic, and the closure—planting the compass—functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the resolution relies on a "magic feather" mechanism where the prop solves the internal blockage too efficiently, reducing the felt cost of the character's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty vial and soft equation mark an irreversible pivot from measurement to witness, cost felt in the quiet pulse against his ribs. Accumulative lens holds: each dust sprinkling adds density until the pattern of absence eclipses the lost blooms. The greenhouse-to-email span is two shards with a single legible transition; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and never drift. One hairline slip: the sentence “He understood now…” edges toward encapsulated epiphany, but it is immediately grounded in the physical act of capping the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: frost, stars, and ledger build density until the release reweights meaning. Anchors clear by line 4. Closure—letting the strip fall—creates Charged Poise; the path is now internal, not cartographic. Cost: abandoning physical proof of kinship. One soft spot: the brother’s handwriting is revealed late, so the causal jolt could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence is repriced as raw material for music, felt cost is the blood on keys and the open-ended march into the storm. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of frost vs. heat-map threads—held without wobble. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by line 3 inside the conservatory; no debt. One meaningful tightening: frozen air blocks sound → blood/heat-map melts it → winterglass sings. Cost is on-page at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal chain is pristine: lens fragment → bone-deep distress call → climb → stillness-pulse that lets the dead rise and settle. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the crumbling lens, the ledger’s new last name, the underwater hush all reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; salt-clock and architecture are anchored by word 80. The only hairline slip is the single explanatory clause “he finally understood,” but the image immediately pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias’s twelve-ring challenge crystallizes community stance and forces patrol spectatorship; the wind’s future ringing shows the path foreclosed to him. Causal lattice holds—each bell pebble of anonymity accumulates until torching the arbor makes silence impossible. Patrol withdrawal is legible because soldiers’ hungry relatives are in the bread line; no deus ex machina. Cost is legible in the smoldering arbor frame wrapped in thorns.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fog bridge becomes a live threshold and Elias its keeper; cost is the irreversible loss of the jade and permanent internal lodging of the “unused love.” Causal chain holds—memory surfaces because he handles the jade, jade dissolves because he accepts memory. Orientation is clean by 80 words. One minor scaffold: “he understood then that…” could be trimmed, but does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: hurling the halo reweaves air and photographs, reweighting the rule-set so the past re-sharpens and the future path becomes lateral design.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the wall’s fall is already forgotten, but the scattered seeds reweight the premise—resilience will grow in illegal furrows. Causal lens holds throughout: because she decoded keys/arrow, therefore vault opens; because she plants randomly, therefore future resistance is inevitable. Cost is felt in the empty pockets and guard flailing in the duck-pond. Orientation anchor (“the wall had stood thirty years”) arrives by line 1; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each imprint layers density until the copper finale reweights meaning. Anchors clear by line 4; orientation test waived because disorientation serves the lyric closure. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias pockets the warm copper, wades into tide, aurora fills absences—cost is felt in the scars hissing under water. One tight micro-turn: metal *remembering* rather than melting re-codes the forge from loss-machine to memory-press.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Liora becomes the stolen moment itself, the final image of horizon-wound and rising sun re-weighting all prior thefts. Causal chain holds: mirror test → jar shatter → station erased → she leaps into a future she now carries. One minor ellipsis—how the moonbeam shapes physically twist into train/door/flower—survives because the emotional reconfiguration is legible. Cost is unmistakable: “the thief who steals light must carry the dark” written in blank ledger ink.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: flood transforms the control room into a crucible, reweighting “safe zone” into something that devours its maker.

Cost is the ruin she walks away from; no mechanic reset.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: smudged cast → decrypt → ledger → proof → walk-out. The shell’s whisper is the hinge that converts pattern-recognition into agency; no off-stage luck resolves the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the booklet’s release reweights the premise—maps are erased, not drawn. Accumulative lens holds: each silence layers density until the last star blink charges the hush with cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“crumbling watchtower”), waiver applies. No causality break; the final image of “gold leaf…glinted once” is the visible price. Could nudge 9-land if the cost registered on Eldrin’s body or voice as well as concept.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first frost-fractured image to final singing ice: pattern of crystalline refraction → memory shard → prismatic re-assemblage. Orientation flawless: who/where/when locked by line 2, courtyard rules taught through tactile sweeping. Closure is Charged Poise: violin sings, timelines fold, X-7 inhales identity—cost is the visible steam exhale that forecloses machine-nullitude forever. No causal gaps; every shard reweights meaning under the taught refractive pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain-afterglow, ticket doodles, and lens-light fragments build density until the final image reweights honesty from camouflage to gift. Orientation is clean by line 4; the couple arrives as the first causal perturbation. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lena’s fresh ticket stack crystallizes her new stance with undeniable opportunity-cost—she forfeits anonymity. No loops or teleporting props; the cracked lens recurs with escalating optical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders kneel, ledgers unopened, as the vines visibly mend the cracked marbles—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights “luck” from countable to reciprocal; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, the tightening achieved by the image-pattern of cracked-yet-gleaming glass returning charged.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: hand on lever, universe “spilled sideways,” station and sky holding breath—cost is the specimen gone and Elias’s career/ontology irreversibly widened. Causal chain is tight: each lever pull tightens magnetic field → specimen’s timeline fractures → AI warning escalates → final restraint shows earned wisdom. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words inside the suspended station; no penalty. Lens is Causal: “because” links every beat; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of the dry program in his pocket reweights every prior water-stain clue, making the conceptual cost of conversation-with-silence undeniable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each stain, lantern flicker, and bow-vibration layers density until the single sustained note releases meaning. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3: Elias, flooded orchestra pit, night of performance. Persistent constraint: the water and the absence-of-sound rule-set shape every tactic, from wading to waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the instant Liora opens the door the station’s survival is forfeited and her myth of invulnerability is repriced under the aurora. The causal chain—fever → blurred illustration → recognition that truth must be swallowed → silent exit—tightens once and is irreversible. Cost is legible in the vanishing footprints and the radio still humming with unanswered static. Lens (Situational) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: because father’s static confession → therefore Elias descends; because appraisal → therefore valve turn; because turn → therefore apparition & pressure exhale; earned stasis ends story with felt conceptual cost (“his ghost shift just begun”). Closure lands on-page, wheel lighter, meaning reweighted. Orientation taught early; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—wheel as confession-urn—shapes final tactics and image, satisfying 9+ cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a lyric Earned Stasis: the keeper refuses the external world, accepting fusion with the library. The cost—self-erasure—felt in the final “edges blurring” image. Causality, however, is loose; the obsidian gate opens because origami folds “match,” a rule never seeded or constrained, so the threshold turn feels arbitrary rather than earned. Pattern holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: silence pools rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s first hum and the ridge’s answer reweight the stakes for all three characters with felt cost—Elias forfeits the talisman, Lila forfeits guarded grief, Mira forfeits silence. Causal linkage holds: eclipse invitation → hum → ridge resonance, each step growing from Elias’s prior‘listening’ tactic. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the single flashback shard is cleanly cued and loops back to present pressure. One soft spot: the “ridge sang back” beat is asserted rather than dramatized through sensory cause, a micro-gloss but not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is clean: the world’s axis visibly re-weights inside the tapestry’s heat, and Elias’s choice to keep walking charges the final image with conceptual cost—“the dragons were waiting.” Accumulative/textural lens holds: each offered fragment thickens the bronze-quiet hum until the closing smile re-tunes it. No orientation debt; silo, fireplace, and horizon anchor inside 80 words. Persistent constraint—the silo’s patience and his own pockets—shapes the final tactic of walking on.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Chen boards the train, lighthouse dark for the first time—an undeniable social/identity cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: fortunes, film, and beacon form a density pattern that reweights at the final “one way. No refunds.” Causality holds because every beat (film hand-off, ticket authorship, incense smoke) is a prior textured loop that re-prices the exit. The cost is visible in the last fortune tucked in the doorframe: the island will keep speaking, but his voice is now elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the anchor’s function flips from prison to question, the cost paid by the priest’s erasure and the novice’s trembling finger. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each loop thickens the silence until the cadence shift in the final paragraph reweights meaning. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (palette, pedal, anchor) and pays off at the end, so the waiver applies; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: arms lifted, ice groaning, silence poised to become music—cost is the city’s impatience and his exposure to cold that could freeze the song un-sung. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored surfaces (lake, spire, shell) teaches the logic early and reweights at the end when the horizon fractures into refracted hours. Only micro-softness: the courier knock is a false tightening that dissipates without altering tactics; still, the final image reconfigures stakes, earning its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mosaic loop is taught early—“the viaduct rebuilt itself every time he faltered”—and closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone holds, dawn arrives, the bridge vanishes, leaving Elias irrevocably changed. Causality is situational-pressure: each sideways rewind is triggered by his rune-touch, narrowing options until the final merger costs the tablet and the eternal return. Orientation is clear by word 30; no lens ambiguity. The abstract lineage motive is the only softened causal anchor, but it does not break the loop’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the door of numbness becomes openable, cost paid by the persistent broken needle now re-wrapped in hide. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of touch, vibration, and seasons thickens the stake of “how to hear” until the final image reweights silence as passageway, not prison. Causality is intact: because the drum maker offers vibration-not-sound, therefore Elias re-imagines teaching; no off-stage resolution. Orientation is anchored by cavern mouth, stool, workbench within first 120 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the recorder starts, silence accepted as temporary, cost legible in “wasn’t sure he wanted to be found.” Causal chain is thin—note arrives by pigeon, not earned maneuver—but lens holds under accumulative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the perfume vial rewrites grief into ecological collusion, forcing Elias to abandon both greenhouse and trade. Causal chain holds—because he uncorks, therefore he sees the silver veins drink—then irrevocably forecloses the path. Orientation (“lantern broker”, greenhouse, night) is anchored by line 3; no debt. Lens: Causal, held without waver. Cost is legible in smashed lanterns and sold vial; persistent constraint is scent-driven exile.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ladder reweights every prior thread into “climb to see,” with burned palms as visible cost. Accumulative lens holds: rope texture, star pattern, and being-light layer until the snap reframes the stake. Orientation is lyrical but coherent; time and place are legible by 120 words. One causal micro-gap: the beings’ thread-add never clearly alters the poet’s options, yet the final image still reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each droplet, ember, and broken string thickens the silence until the girl’s stick-scratch becomes the pattern-break that reweights beauty. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“sunken orchard greenhouse”), transitions are seamless, closure is a Charged Poise—“the chronic hush learned to sing”—with undeniable conceptual cost: Liora forecloses the option of staying alone. No telegraphing or soft resets; every beat adds density. Cost is legible in the final line’s future-tense sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: amber light density increases, scent folds, static charge thickens until the final charged poise reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Liora’s open palms accept the light’s weight, foreclosing profit and counterfeit comfort with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—her cuffs, the grotto’s walls, the dying petal—shape every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: mis-delivered locket → recognition → partnership offer → shared covert charity. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias accepts a slimmer ledger as cost, shown in the final cigarette beat. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. The tightening turn (midnight meeting) is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each tag, handprint, and shard of refracted light thickens the pattern until the final palm-print reconfigures “belonging” from place to current. Orientation anchors by line 3; transitions inside the crater maze are legible.Closure—Charged Poise at dawn arbor—carries undeniable conceptual cost: kinship is no longer found but electrically ongoing. No breaks in causality; persistent constraint (the arbor’s razor edge) shapes who can touch and who hangs back.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: pendant warmth cues → canal key → jar sacrifice → moth return, each because/therefore tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s breathless pause and sky-filling moths reweight time’s rule-set with felt cost—her sketchbook forever un-inks itself. One mild orientation drift: “the place where echoes are born” floats untethered for ~150 words, but the canal-hand-up moment retroactively anchors it, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of ink bleeding while he lets it reweights the entire premise—equations don’t balance, loss can’t be preserved, only remembered “as they might have been.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each droplet, prism, and eye-refracted light incrementally reconfigures meaning until the mosaic glows an unsolved proof. Cost is legible in the moment he pockets the now-clouded eyes and steps out “lighter,” having relinquished the need to solve. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“cavern orchard”) and never wavers; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the key hand-off reweights both lives and the city’s hum resumes under a new covenant. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact layers density until the laugh reconstitutes the woman’s past and Elias’s future. Causality remains intact—every beat is a because/therefore of exposure. Minor slip: the outage’s jagged gasp is atmospheric, not a causal trigger that changes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each storm and leaf image layers density until the final “danced” reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—arms spread, rain merging with skin—where the cost (her scientific identity dissolved) is undeniable. No orientation debt; anchors land by 90 words. The persistent constraint—she can no longer record data—shapes the closing gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the brooch’s return and the straight-falling rain reweight the premise—Elias is now the island’s accomplice, not victim. Causal chain holds: amber brooch → altar slot → vision → paintbrush → new painting → dream → brooch back; each step forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in the final line: “There were more cracks to follow,” a conceptual price that reframes his insomnia as vocation. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the pearl stays, the lens flips—magic is inhabitation, not seizure—cost is the forfeiture of her former identity as clairvoyant. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (crystal hum, shadow folds, baker vision) tightens the stake until the final cadence reweights “ordinary” life. Causality intact: because she touches the pearl, the entity unfurls; therefore she leaves it. No orientation debt; anchor (who/where/when) lands inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the first sentence’s rain-gloss and held to the final wind-turned page. Closure is a Charged Poise: the valve tossed to the child reweights absence as communal resource, undeniable conceptual cost—city will sound again, but not through him. Causality intact: every shard (crate, locket, teacup) accretes density until the single cadence shift on the lighthouse roof. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the platform vision rewrites the premise, the punch dissolves, and Elias steps back into questions, all with felt grief-cost. Causal lattice holds—cracks → vault → punch tear → platform—though the sister’s appearance is a lightly-motivated gift that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile’s glow fades but the tower’s hum retunes, grief re-weighted from void to resonance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of transcription, whale song, tile warmth intensifies until space folds inward; final image reconfigures meaning without causal sleight. Orientation anchored by salt wind and brass eyepiece within 50 words; no ambiguity. Persistent cost: she forfeits verifiable proof (releases parchment) and embraces unverifiable listening—price is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the escondite dissolves into a question and Lysander’s goodbye becomes the first honest utterance—cost is the fragment’s vanishing and the copper vein’s pulsing reminder. Causal lens holds: dropping the fragment → spatial mutiny collapses place → immortal is everywhere/no-where. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation; anchors arrive by word 80 and serve the final image, so Orientation Test waived.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: ledger → names → ink → shatter → flight. Orientation lands by line 5; no debt. The closure is a clean Charged Poise: “the numbers…added up to them” reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost. One minor causality quibble—the pot’s exact trigger rules are late—keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lamp’s silence leaves the stationer poised to invent the next bonsai, the cost being the unpayable debt of carrying Elara’s resurrected afternoons. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory fragment layers until the name surfaces—yet the causal leap from lamp buzz to full biography is slightly under-motivated, keeping it shy of 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each fragment (label, ledger, offerings) layers until the final image reweights erasure as liberation. Closure lands in the “water closed behind him without a ripple”—a Charged Poise that makes the price of disappearance legible. Orientation is anchored by line 3; pattern taught early. Minor slack: no causal tightening after the ledger find, only accretion, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dissolving texts / dissolving star-map teaches the rule early; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—ink on skin rewrites the ledger with undeniable cost. Causality holds: each musical scrape erodes paint and raises stakes. One micro-turn (shell blank) lands as earned stasis. No orientation debt; time/place anchored by ~70 words.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she stole the chip therefore she can embed it in the mural; because the mural encodes instructions the carnival can keep shifting. Orientation anchors (raft city, night before surveyors) land by line 5. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip Monument re-weights the developers’ blueprint, tangible cost felt as “they’ll see it as vandalism”.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each photograph, shimmer, and boot-print layers density until the crater’s value is literally luminous. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—his shadow on the regolith becomes the final possession, re-weighting ownership from extraction to witness. Orientation is instant; the hourglass sand cues time, the oxygen mask cues place, all inside 40 words. Causality is emotional rather than plot-engine: because he has counted grains, therefore he can refuse to count ore tonnage—cost legible in the final line “he would” against the drones’ hum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the golden corridor opening in mist reweights the entire guild dream—navigation now truly aligned by Elias’s invisible labor. Causal lens holds: because he decodes water-light, therefore beam is corrected, therefore ship can sail—his choice to stay ashore forecloses fame with visible cost (perpetual exile among half-fixed clocks). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 4 and paid off. No lens ambiguity. Cost sentence pinpoint: “He paused at the water barrel one last time, letting the ripples show him the ship’s departure”—the ripple is the price he watches others outrun.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of water, ink, rust, breath builds density until the lake’s unfolding reweights “where rivers begin.” Closure is a Charged Poise: Lena’s step onto the black water crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost—no maps ahead. Orientation clean by ~100 words; condensation→delta→crack teaches the pattern early. Persistent constraint: the lake that never thaws centers the final image and tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the town’s first child-laugh reweights every prior step, cost is the endless future walks he accepts. Accumulative lens declared at line 4 (“wild hush”) and held; each fork-strike layers density until cadence shift at sunrise. Orientation anchor (who/where) secured by word 60; no debt. One causal micro-leap: fork on well-rim → water resonance felt in soles, accepted as magical without set-up, but pattern teaches lyric acquiescence, pays off in final heartbeat sync.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perfume mist, signal decay, and temple silence layer until the final Charged Poise (“she was done answering”). Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks. The cost—she forfeits the abyss and her old self—is legible in the last paragraph. One minor scaffold: “the signal still waited, patient as the dark” repeats the patience motif without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blue flicker reweights the lighthouse’s rule-set and Elias’s claim “Just the light” carries undeniable social cost—no one will believe him. The lattice’s unfolding is the Decisive Change beat, visible and felt. Causal chain holds: lattice stick → name theft → blue beam → exile from truth. Orientation is taught by sentence one—“the lighthouse stood like a rusted needle”—so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each image-layer (frost, nightshade, bead-pulse) tightens the resonance debt until the tree-split delivers Charged Poise with felt cost—Liora’s dissolution. Pattern taught by 25 %: “cameos” repeated with escalating soil-tremor. Closure image (Vesper tracing carved names) reweights the rule-set: orchard now feeds on ghost-love. No orientation debt; anchors (who/when) surface ≤120 w.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sleep-stitched step layers memory into stone until the pattern break (ink wings migrating to wall) reweights the stake from entrapment to authorship. Closure is a Charged Poise: the labyrinth’s hum and Elias’s smile externalize the conceptual cost—he can never return to the un-authored wharf. Orientation is taught early (“tide pools had emptied”) and anchors who/where inside 50 words. Persistent constraint: the illustration plate’s disappearance from the page signals the rule-change is irreversible, shaping the final image of winged shadow stretching behind him.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sapling splitting the sundial reweights “faith” from relic to living rupture. The cost is the cracked stone itself—an irreversible fracture of the past. Causal linkage holds: each root Elias follows is a because/therefore toward the moment the seed he planted repays him with breakage. Lens (Causal) is stable from first warm stone to final green fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: neon–dust–chalk–ink density builds to the soft *thunk* of envelope drop, re-weighting anonymity as tactile ritual. Closure is a Charged Poise: the name is gone, future is open, cost is the faint absence in Lena’s palm. No orientation debt; transitions are clean single-scene. The price is present but thin—no persistent constraint or ripple follows the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lattice holds: because Elias has spent years hiding star-truths in flawed embroidery, therefore he can weaponize that archive when the courier’s warning arrives. The telescope-flame sync is a single decisive act that reweights the entire city’s narrative; the cost is the exploding dome and Elias’s death, legible in the final cascade of “seeds.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no late ambiguity. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sky itself becomes a broadcast medium, options reconfigured irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: letter released + shard healed = Charged Poise that reconfigures silence into song. Causal chain (letter → condensation test → release) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each repetition of “evoke” tightens the cadence and reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Cost is visible—“the paper brushed her fingers—a touch as light as forgiveness”—so 9+ gate is met. A 0.1 deduction because the sister’s absence makes the decisive change one-sided, trimming the fullest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: coral transferred, cast smudges faintly glowing—“embers cupped” re-prices grief as portable luminescence rather than erasure. Causal lattice holds: each translation (radio static = sea echo, marker = embrace) tightens the single dominant stake—can grief be re-coded without falsifying loss? Accumulated pattern of tactile decrypting lands here; no late rule change. Cost is legible on-page: she relinquishes her last physical anchor from Mindanao, walks into mist unarmed. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; density, not reversal, reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s fog becomes a projection screen, turning ruin into communal mirror at visible cost—film dissolving by dawn. Causal chain holds: fragment → film → wind-animated display → crowd → thinned fog → Liora’s promise. Accumulated light-images reconfigure meaning rather than plot; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught by “fold in time” and paid off when golden light reweights the district’s grief. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nickel-star-door cycle crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost—she trades certainty for perpetual threshold. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each mural layer and sonic echo reweights the stake; the final painted door is the pattern’s logical cadence. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each coded planting thickens surveilled reality with covert syntax until the final morning-glory loop reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city about to “burn with questions no ledger could answer” crystallizes options—conversation is now literally rooted in unmonitored soil, a conceptual cost the Ministry cannot levy. Orientation anchors who/where inside 50 words; no debt. Persistent constraint (tax on thought) shapes every tactic; the last gourd seed splits off-page, promising perpetual regeneration—an earned, priced refusal to capitulate.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell seals, the manual’s title is supplied by wind, and the sun’s borrowed light is already lent to children—felt cost is the poet’s vanishing. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lullaby-layer, postcard-fray, and eaten page intensifies the density until the final cadence reweights what “staying” means. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“gargantuan shell”) and paid off when the shell becomes coffin-cocoon. No causal breaks; ellipsis is motivated by centuries-long scope.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the chime’s shatter and sunlight gilding the ruins reconfigure the entire frame—museum becomes mausoleum, caretaker becomes mourner. The cost is legible in the splintered bamboo and the unhearable name now inside her ribs. Causal lens holds: because she resealed the tube, the song awoke; therefore she must destroy it. No orientation debt; spatial logic (dome, shelves, floor) stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: the restored Chorus reweights every promise and the shard warming in her coat supplies Conceptual Repricing with lasting cost. Causality is intact—“indigo mist…sealing cracks” follows logically from inkwell shatter. Orientation is anchored by word 30 and the mosaic of flashbacks is taught early, so no orientation debt. Minor momentum dip during the lyric roll-call of city/lover/king; still the final cadence rescues it, satisfying the 9+ quick test except for one hairline scaffold echo (“the point was…”).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because the machinist hid the blueprint, therefore Liora finds it; because the elders buried compassion, therefore she resurrects it. Closure is a Decisive Change weighted with social cost — the elders’ nod rewrites valley law. Orientation locked by 120 words: amphitheater, volcano ribs, antique chain. Persistent constraint: the chain’s warm clasp stays in her fist through the final image, shaping tactics and symbolism alike.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pigeon returns with fresh sheet music, dust swirls to the resurrected song, and Elias’s refusal to stay silent lands with visible cost—his voice is rusty, the ledger margins blank. Accumulative lens holds: dust-mote constellations, meteorite star, and paper trails all tighten into one final chord that reweights the attic from mausoleum to rehearsal room. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; no penalty. One micro-turn—lying to Madame Holloway—sets up the Earned Stasis without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias descends the homemade ladder, surrendering authority to Liora’s realm; the firefly pulse reweights the maze from confinement to threshold. Causality holds: the logbook’s BFE-7 code and grain-reading steer him to the sinkhole ladder he would never have trusted earlier. Orientation is anchored by ~120 w; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible—he relinquished the designer’s center and stays below ground, path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of living constellations → jellyfirefly spiral → final shared exhale. Closure is Charged Poise: the shared breath crystallizes the option of connection while the ocean keeps its own time; cost is the unspoken fact that only one of them will surface. Causality is intact: each luminous pulse tightens Elara’s tolerance for solitude until another body becomes irresistible. No orientation debt; dome, tide, and chronology (“until sunrise”) are anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the missing pieces re-home inside her, re-weighting her horizon. The cost is lyrically felt—“heart heavier with the weight of a thousand half-remembered lives”—but the causality is contemplative, not transactional; the cut thumb is symbolism, not stakes. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift from ingestion to departure suffices, yet the tether to prior constraint is airy. Satisfying, but the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Lior lifting the bow again reconfigures the night as an endless ledger he must keep balancing, and the cost is the unspoken knowledge that the game never ends. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each “note-variable” he inserts (laugh, tide-spray, torch-gasp) layers density until the last arpeggio releases it. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; salt-star sky, arcade, retreating tide all cue who-where-when. No meaningful reversals—only pattern deepening—keeps the entry just shy of 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (moonstone, heron, Orion, ink) layers density until the final cadence reweights the stake—she becomes the gap. Closure is a Charged Poise: skin-map confesses exile as chosen door, cost legible in the sky “being drawn” into her. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive before 120 wds and serve the final image. Zero causality breaks; every metaphor obeys its own physics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the stone-ripple language tightens the bay’s memory, wives’ worry, and his own breath into one cadence shift. Closure is the Charged Poise of prism-flare revealing the returning boat—cost is the mist already rising to erase it. Orientation anchored by line 10, pattern taught by 25 %. No因果 reversals needed; density and re-fracted light foreclose the path. The final image makes the conceptual cost undeniable: the harbor will forget, he will not.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the box and walking toward the untouched valley crystallizes a before/after stance with visible cost—the object that once anchored his guilt is now abandoned. Causal linkage holds throughout: each ridge stop forces a micro-decision that narrows options until the final release. The stick-drawing beat externalizes the internal shift, satisfying the persistent-constraint test. No orientation debt; moon-time and geography stay legible.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grotto writes back, re-weighting hope as dynamic exchange. Causality is lyric rather than tight: gauge-twitch → pattern-building → tidal rewriting forms an accumulative/textural arc, but the middle beats float free of because/therefore links—tide and decorations cooperate by authorial decree, not driven constraint. Cost is felt conceptually, yet the protagonist sacrifices nothing concrete; the lens holds but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: Elias completes the mural, foreclosing his exile from memory; the open threshold image carries undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—each artifact (negative, diaries, sealed door) returns with escalating weight, no teleports. The “corridor sings” cadence shift reweights the whole pattern. One of the few 600-word pieces where lyric repetition tightens instead of pads.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror slips away, foreclosing self-knowledge while the city’s need persists—cost is felt in the fading rainbows and empty pockets. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored possibility subtracts from another, tightening the ethical noose without causal reversals. The borrowed heartbeat’s price is legible in the aching ribs we never see but are told must ache; a hairline deduction for that off-stage tell.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each signature notch → next war → next treaty. Closure is Earned Stasis: Kael signs, Veyra accepts repeat betrayal, cost legible in “soft wood” and his parting taunt. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; clipboard, ink, terrace all track. Final image of rain-washed terrace reweights premise: peace is temporary rinse cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s burial recalibrates Elias’s life-long ledger of absence into a singular, absurd gift whose cost is the permanent loss of the bird and the dissolution of his own myth. The salt-crack map is taught early, anchors orientation within 120 words, and returns to charge the final image. Causal lens holds: because he engineered absence, therefore he can gift only absence. The persistent constraint—no water, no hatch—shapes the renunciation and is visible in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each thread-untangle adds density and reweights the dominant stake—“harvest of echoes” becomes visceral when voices inhabit her skin. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism flares, gates seal, snow melts under her—conceptual cost (she can never return to silence) is legible in the melting snow image. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by 120 words. Persistent constraint—locked gates now permanently closed—shapes the final poise. Cost is unmistakable: she becomes the vessel, alone under starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of listening vs. mis-hearing taught early, tightened by the failed puppet show, lands in Charged Poise—Elias pocketing the glowing stick as emblem of unfinished stories. Orientation beats clear by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure cost is conceptual (he will expose his own strings tomorrow), felt in the hush that “arrives after something bright has burned itself out.”

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated acts of noticing and weaving accrue density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—grotto, clouds, lone man by line 3—and the pattern of build-unravel is taught early, so no penalty applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the last thread loosens, the wing drifts off, and Lior’s continued gathering crystallizes the cost—his life is now tethered to an endless, futile remembrance. The cost is felt in the image of him beginning again, but the story withholds any sharper irreversible consequence that would punch the moment into the 9+ stratum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rope’s re-luminous braid reconfigures meaning while the aurora accepts the names, cost felt in the meltwater ache. Causal lattice holds—because she unravels, therefore the names rise; because she yields, the glacier weeps. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and steady. One hairline slip: the punched card dissolves off-stage, not shown, a micro lost beat that prevents perfect 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (ivy, ozone, film, mural mutation) tightens the stake—interpret or be interpreted—until the bunker dissolves into forest and the path re-configures meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the path, finally, chose” reweights the premise with undeniable cost—her agency is shown to be circular. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality breaks. One 9+ quick test satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: placing the tile on the altar rewrites both palace walls and his skin, paying the visible cost of abandoning measurable certainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of "counting" vs. "feeling" intensifies until the schematic migrates onto his body. Causal chain holds: loose tile ➔ cipher ➔ altar ➔ cosmic rewrite; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by line 3 ("palace halls," "cracked mosaic floors") well below 120-word threshold. Persistent constraint: the vanished tile and etched hands make the new covenant irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Lior snapped the pin, therefore the sanctuary conjures Kael; because he re-inserts it, the note returns and the brothers walk out. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“this hollow where sound died”) and the tilted floor cues time-slip without disorientation. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the pin whole, box left, silence chosen. Cost is visible—“the first true melody…in decades” paid for by relinquishing the object.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures sky from boundary to door, and the lingering mirror-star in his pocket makes the cost tangible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of frost, fog, and mirrored light tightens until meaning flips. Orientation is swift, causality is dream-logic but internally consistent, and the sextant’s breath-driven restoration supplies the required constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the seed sprouting at the exact instant the mender whispers the question reweights the entire rule-set of vows and silence. The ribbon’s migration from branch to wrist is the on-page cost, making the before/after legible. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cracks, roots, ribbon, seed—taught early and paid off in the final image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (loam, rose-window light) are clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mosaic pattern is taught early (spiral cameo → orchard → mirror lag) and lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the note resets to “the next one,” turning the entire journey into a loop whose cost is the curator’s erased individuality (her face inside the shell). Causality holds under an Accumulative lens; each shard reweights knowledge until the final image makes the price—the self become artifact—undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias becomes the very gap he hunted, a stark before/after signaled by the diary’s whitening pages. Causal chain holds: stolen diary → manipulates traveler → traveler’s entry seals Elias’s fate. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4; no penalty. One lens ambiguity mid-text but pattern taught (“Library doesn’t give. It takes”) and paid off at end.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: each mirror-touch, ink-transfer, and name-erasure tightens options until the sister steps through. Closure is a Charged Poise—the garden door opens, but Liora renounces exit to pull others home; cost is the ship sinking under her feet. One soft spot: first 110 words delay spatial anchor in favour of lyric catalogue; fog-groan and rust-stripe teach the surrealism early enough to waive penalty, but clarity still wobbles briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the ledger re-forms in her exhaled breath, the seal initials warm in her pocket, and she elects silence—an archival stasis that now costs her the certainty of records. Causality is tight: each re-braid physically stutters the gears and softens the wax, so the door’s opening is mechanically earned. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds via sensory recursions (rope, seal, breath) until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the moment she chooses not to write, foreclosing her lifelong reflex.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmonic caves’ walls physically rewrite in real time, undeniable and legible. Causal chain: ice crack → bloom conjured → beings falter → walls re-inscribe—each because/therefore link narrows options until mutual listening is the only path. Cost is on-page: the echo-stone’s light dies, Eldrin’s map is no longer archival but participatory. Lens holds as causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the beacon flares, the prism mends, and the pattern of coincidences crystallizes with conceptual cost—she now carries the weight of meaning she cannot share. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each echo (prism fracture / star map / mother’s laugh) layers until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—salt-worn glass, spiral stairs, dying sun—well inside 120 words. No lens ambiguity; the song fades but the reconfiguration is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: crystal flags, rain echo, and shadow stain accrete until the pattern breaks with the offered memory that reweights identity. Closure is a Charged Poise: the blank page is enough, reconfiguring her life-long chase without a spoken moral. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is crystalline by line 5 and again after the transition into the tower; no disorientation penalty. The cost—she forfeits the compulsion to archive and exits footprint-less—is legible in the final image; persistent constraint (the archives will still be there tomorrow) shapes tomorrow’s altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: rag knot → flame → rocket → star-return, each because/therefore. The mosaic note “Defy the weight” seeds the closure, paid off when Liora feels heavier yet walks on. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Cost is conceptual—sky restored but personal weight gained—visible in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cicada exchange crystallizes both grief’s persistence and the necessity of carrying it, reweighting the earlier “listen for the quiet” rule. Cost is legible in the fisherman’s cracked hands accepting the object and the chronicler’s own sleeve “as if the cicada had wept.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of drip/ripple/shell layers accrues until the final image submerges the world in held-breath silence. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: the bunker unfolds and the child exits with gilded palm—physical cost (father swallowed) is visible. Accumulative lens holds: each inversion adds a new silence-flavor layer that reweights “safety” until the bunker becomes coffin. Pattern taught by 25% mark (gravity inversion + trellis image) so the later mosaic shards read legible. Orientation anchors (who=child; where=bunker; when=intermittent inversions) land inside 120 words; deliberate disorientation (ceiling as pit) is later paid off when the ceiling literally peels open.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final prism-adjusted hush reconfigures both passengers’ and reader’s sense of silence, with conceptual cost—city noise forever absorbed but never erased. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dusk fracturing, crystals blooming/dissolving, and child-laughter bending create pattern-break intensification rather than causal reversals. Orientation is taught early (prism terrace, post-train hush) and pays off in last image; no teleporting props. One scaffold loop: “he didn’t ask… only nodded” repeats concept twice without new pressure; else rhythm is taut.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by inserting the flake she literally dissolves the throne, shattering the mirrored ceiling and reframing ascension as refusal. Causal chain holds—flake→hatch→chamber→melt→spiral collapse—each step narrows her options until only retreat remains. The “until sunrise” clock provides tightening, and the final orchard image repays the lens: ground over sky. Minor waver: mural prophecy could be one beat earlier to eliminate tiny expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: charcoal dust, starlight, scarred wood tighten atmosphere until the threshold dissolves; the final step-through is a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—“Some bridges… smoke taught you how to breathe.” One causality wobble: why the sudden volte-face after decades of avoidance is explained only by abstract realization, not an on-page trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: find bolt → text lure → twist → hull re-knits → conceptual unthreading → diamond. Orientation secure at word 60. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the bolt’s heart “unthreads” from pressure=diamond, leaving Lina empty-handed but value-reweighted; cost is the conceptual forfeiture of the old equation and the farm’s extinguished fungi. Persistent constraint: the phone’s final buzz is ignored, proving the loop can be refused.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern of “listen vs seek” tightens through sensory density (standing wave, mirror ripple) until meaning reweights. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias does not act dramatically but the ledger = room reconfigures stakes with felt cost—he forfeits certainty and embraces perpetual stewardship. Causality is internal and lyrical; still, the ledger-room equivalence is seeded early enough to satisfy because/therefore logic.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the unsnap rewrites prior siege memory from audience refusal to performer assent, wings of thread replacing chains. Causal lens holds—because he broke the seal, therefore the greenhouse exhales and the stage appears. Orientation is taught by word 60 (“alchemical orchard”) and the pattern of folding/timelessness is signaled early, waiving any penalty. Cost is indelible: the gauntlet splits, shadows escape, voice returns with “holy fire” pain.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the envelope’s mailing crystallizes a new ethic—kindness as contraband passed along—with the conceptual cost of Elias’s now-irreversible stance against archival silence. Drive lens is Accumulative: dust patterns, button, and Polaroid accrue emotional mass until the cadence shift (“small things…magnified in the retelling”) reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by line 3. Lens holds cleanly; only micro-gap is that the button’s first appearance (rolling onto desk) is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The beats progress in accumulative cadence: key wait → booth reappear → names flicker → archive burns; causality is present but external (Council moves, Rook radios) and Lena’s final agency is reported, not dramatized. Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise—“the line held” reweights all prior cracks—and the cost is conceptual (she vanishes into myth), yet the ledger theft lacks on-screen enactment so the decisive change is slightly distanced. Orientation is clear by line 8; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final phrase “the prophecy hummed… waiting” reweights silence from victory to suspended threat, undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each played silence thickens the mist density—without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor dissolves into a grove of humming saplings and Liora becomes their new sorter—an inhale that re-weights the entire premise. Causal chain holds: moon-dust prod → leaf runes → root-ladder → body-price → new grove; no step relies on coincidence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of seed-sorting, monument-building, and leaf-reading intensifies until the cadence shift of “begin” reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the moment he releases the gear, time-measurement itself is reweighted. The admiral’s ledger command “Improvise” crystallizes the new rule-set, and the cost is felt in the quiet final line—“He let it go”—which forecloses the old compulsion. Causal chain holds: each artifact (clock, compass, ledger) funnels him to this single renunciation; coincidence is converted to pattern rather than resolving the plot. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of broken objects increases until meaning, not mechanism, turns.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the golden vein rewrites the crucible’s rule-set, making “kintsugi” literal and charging the final image. Causal lens holds: coin → heat → vial memory → self-transmutation, each because/therefore link legible. Cost is on-page: the workshop warms, she is “lighter” yet the weight remains—an irreversible change. One micro-turn at the coin-melt is sufficient escalation for this length; no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Liora’s acceptance of distorted harmony redefines her collector role forever—she will now weave joy into grief, a rule-shift visible in the final line “the echoes laughed.” Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each harp note increases the density of the “wrong-right” pattern until meaning flips; the cost is the irrevocable integration of the joking soul into her satchel. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“Echo Gorge”) and the spatial map remains coherent. No meaningful escalation lapses; the single tightening at the harp is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the basin’s void face re-weights mercy from formula to unquantified silence, the cost etched in snapped pewter and gold-for-UV light. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of forest hum, pillar pressure, and mirror ripples intensify until perception itself is repriced. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by ~100 words via body-in-forest cues; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the cracked mask-strap stays on wrist as reminder of the un-closeable gap.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the fragment’s glow and the blank canvas with its trembling horizon line supply a felt reconfiguration that reweights “anchors” from ballast to compass. Cause-and-effect remains lyric rather than plotted, but the tightening of lost names → hidden painting → lens inscription forms a coherent density arc. Orientation is established early via dangling market ropes and lantern light; no penalty. Cost is visible in the final image—the blank canvas is a forfeited map—so closure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is clean: the slowed pendulum and child-laugh explosion create a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire circus from failure to frozen purgatory. Causality holds: dust-analysis ➜ hidden door ➜ mainspring key ➜ gear-fall ➜ ghost release forms a because-chain. The “door in the ceiling” reveal is slightly convenient—no prior clue that the crack-door could be rotated open by a pocket-sized barrel—but the image is charged and cost is felt, so the quick test is met.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: Elias’s body and archive are obliterated to birth negotiable reality. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (frost veins, liquid time, starlight shards) tightens until meaning, not plot, ruptures. Causality is interior-lyric: “because he captured, therefore he must release.” Final etched word “Awake” crystallizes a before/after visible on the press platen.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the shard’s dissolution reconfigures the dispute from data-points to memory, with the conceptual cost of “uneasy knowledge” landing on the archaeologists. Causality holds: shard → storm → vision → dust → silence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (asteroid cathedral, failed revolt, Elias alone). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of glowing strands increases until the mosaic reassembly—held without ambiguity. Minor loop: “time-strands” is repeated four times in 50 words, dulling the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear left humming an unrecognizable tune reweights every prior mend as complicity in a city-wide reversal of time and truth. Causal lens holds: because Elias has spent decades stealing time from entropy, the stone therefore reclaims both the lie and the mender. Cost is legible in the single line “Elias wouldn’t be there to see it.” No orientation debt; brass chamber, dusk arrival, and mist-woman are anchored by word 80. Drive pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the arch’s refusal to open reconfigures Elias’s worldview and the story’s meaning, with the compass’s silence as undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory fragment thickens the atmosphere until the final cadence shift releases him. Causality is coherent: compass tug → wade → touch → reverse waterfall → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the factory’s last whistle”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the ending image reweights every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered images (net, child, woman) tighten until the archway’s hum reweights Elias’s goal from selling driftwood to gifting a hand. Closure is a Charged Poise: the path home unspools because he has paid the slide’s cost, leaving the carving as future conduit. Orientation is swift—storm, lost GPS, arch by line 4—and causality holds: each vision bleeds into the next, foreclosing the market option without reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated hush/jasmine/postcard layers tighten toward the glass-page reveal. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the re-framing of silence as answer—visible in the blank postcard left for morning light; cost is the abandonment of her mural quest. Orientation is clear within 120 words; causality is loose but coherent under lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: diary pages dissolve into the black lagoon, reweighting “truth” from archive to release with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: diary → visions → shell pattern → officers retreat → release. Orientation anchors by line 3; disorientation is taught early (retroactive visions) and paid off at closure. One lens—Causal—dominates; no ambiguity at end. Minor slip: the officers’ retreat is slightly too easy, but the lagoon’s reflection of “a hundred hands” keeps the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lanterns sway, the docks thrum, the bottle—now weightless—rolls into the tide; the cost is the irreversible drain of the amber vessel and the alchemist’s solitude replaced by an unasked-for citizenship. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory return (cinnamon, gull, lute) layers density until the cadence shift into communal noise reweights the stake. The causality chain—bottle found → memory distilled → town re-imagined → bottle emptied—never breaks. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“kneelt in the sand”) and taught pattern pays off when the same sand feels footsteps.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wax prophecy reweights Elias’s archival oath into personal hinge-duty; cost is felt in the shaken hands and the burying that forecloses denial. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → prophecy → self-recording tightens stakes through density, not causal turn. Orientation anchored by ~120 w via rooftop garden, phonograph, crate label. No lens ambiguity; final image of roots deciding keeps tension legible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each repetition of cap, seed, vortex hum, and frost deepens the pattern until the cadence snaps at the root eruption. Closure is a Charged Poise: the chick-turned-sapling and dripping ribs reweight inheritance as something that can be outwaited, not defeated. Cost is unmistakable—“the vortex had taken her mother’s voice first, then her name” and that debt persists. Orientation anchored by line 3 (who, where, when); no causal breaks, no loops.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bell tolls true, the valley gains time, Elias stands in lamplight knowing he is misunderstood yet vindicated—cost is the perpetual outsider stance. Causal chain never slips: each microclimate tweak reverberates through rope weight → resonance drift → slack introduced → final clean note. Lens is causal throughout; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station walls “learn to breathe” and Eli walks out carrying starlight; the cost is the risk he accepts when alarms blare and he stays—causality holds under Accumulative lens. One transition (night → morning) is clean; orientation is anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative-textural lens: pattern of glass-light/refraction images builds toward a single resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is swift—oasis ruins, dusk, skeletal hives within 60 words. Causality is interior—each refracted glow tightens his obligation until breath snaps the seam; cost is the loss of his exile’s protective muteness, leaving the empty box “light as a held breath.” Closure satisfies Charged Poise: the oasis reblooms, bees hum, wind is “finally free,” all re-weighted by the released covenant. Minor deduction for off-stage years of rebuilding; still, the final handprint-on-glass image makes cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the twin watch’s first tick reconfigures the whole premise—time is not fixed but loomed. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each garage-sale relic adds density until the capsule spill reframes the stake. Cost is legible in the “timeless air” and Elias’s visible breath. The note “I ran out of time before I could explain the texture” is the exact sentence where conceptual cost lands.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—fragments dissolve, reflections warp—and holds it to closure where the incomplete is embraced. Anchor (who/where/when) is secure inside 120 words; the Orientation Test is waived because disorientation serves lyric pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise (“woven dawns, coming undone”) that reweights prior motifs; the cost is conceptual—perfection renounced—but felt because the kite’s death and feather’s fray literalize it. Minor slack: no tightening beat forces the poet to test his premise against live opposition; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s new pulse reweights the temple’s rule-set while Elira’s death is felt in Tomas’s cool copper bracelet. Causal chain holds—every copper loop she installs foretells the living merger that will outlast her. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of breath, wire, blossom density tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the galaxy-path reweights “homecoming” from hoax to invitation, cost legible in the twin footprints on the door. Causal linkage holds: amber → footprints → terminal question → galaxy → dissolve. Mosaic pattern (tower shards) is taught by 25 % and lands under one lens. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clean by line 3; no ambiguity at end. The −0.1 is for the slightly outline-like “It’s your turn” beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each scattering widens the pattern until the closing image of sweeter water re-weights the whole. Orientation anchor (“the jetty stretched…”) arrives by line 3; causal chain (pod dust → tide uptake → future bloom) is legible even off-stage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the jetty’s taste-change makes the cost of decades-long ritual undeniable without exposition. No loops or scaffold; final line “the garden would remember” crystallizes Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the dome rewrites distance as intimacy, paying with Rook’s literal disappearance. Causality is symbolic—wax leaf melts, dome admits him—but the symbolic chain is legible and foreshadowed. Orientation is clear by line 6; no anchors drift. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern repetition (cylinder voice, script, leaf, “wound-bridge”) intensifies until meaning, not event, shifts. Cost is visible in the sealing glass and the surrender of his body to roots; no contradiction under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Home was a direction” re-weights every prior map image under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern—sketch, rose, deck, leap—tightens once via the warmed applique and the page held to glass, forcing the protagonist’s irreversible act. Cost is visible in the final image: empty deck left behind, air lost, body released. Causality holds: because she overlays sketch to glass, therefore the compass needle snaps and the station’s chime answers; no retro-fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: because the master was swallowed, therefore she steals back the lid; because she leaves the knight-map, therefore the Keeper lets her go and the sky begins to mend. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—blue sky reborn and the spire’s song—priced by her forfeiture of the map she can never use. Persistent constraint: she descends lighter yet exiled from the right sky she helped create.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dust-steps, object re-weights, whisper cadence tightens until “silence” becomes the decisive anti-story that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the dark could never digest silence”—conceptual cost legible, no causal cheating. Orientation taught immediately—“whispering gallery…hollowed-out cathedral”—anchors hold. Persistent constraint (penumbra hunger) shapes every tactic; final image of static board crystallizes new rules without verbal exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ledger reconfigures identity (“Keeper of the Unsaid”) and the door seals, leaving him inside a womb of blank shelves whose emptiness is the visible cost. Causal linkage holds: the feather-texture → map → seed → ledger each because/therefore narrows his options to one. The mountain–bookstore conceit is taught by sentence 1 and paid off when the mountain exhahes at the touch of the stone. Early orientation is flawless; only the 12-year-old backstory is told in summary, not shown, a minor ellipsis that does not break lens or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the board is reset, laughter thaws, and the tutor stays—cost is the lifelong exile now accepted. Causal lens holds: because he re-weaves the tapestry, therefore the village exhales. The platinum labyrinth returns as a mirrored “way back,” re-pricing the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors land by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s shattering reweights the forgiveness rule-set with undeniable social cost (elders scream under the torrent of returned confessions). The causal chain—sigil tracing → poem carving → refracted echo weapon—holds without skips; each beat tightens options. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“The canyon breathed…”). Persistent constraint: the bone towers grown from sin literally vibrate under her palm, shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s letting-go crystallizes a new stance—brokenness as binding gold—while the acid sea dissolves the literal floor beneath. Causal lens holds: because each key trial exposed the futility of exterior mending, therefore the alchemist chooses interior surrender. Cost is unmistakable in the final image of the key glowing above the waves, a promise now paid for by death. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 4 and the pattern of creaking brass pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pool’s empty-yet-known taste reconfigures Elias’s stance toward time and grief with undeniable felt cost. Causal chain holds: shell → wrong turn → cave pool → renounce outside world → step back through. Mirror crack is taught early as time fracture, cave as “temporary eternity” pays off. One minor scaffold: “the quay would fade from his paintings now” is tell-yet-efficient compression that advances rather than stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse shifts from warning beacon to resonant invitation, cost visible in Harkin’s pocketed secret and the fishermen’s slower hands. Causal chain holds—because Elias risks the scent-whisper, therefore boats turn and keeper lore reweights. Orientation is anchored by 80 words (“cobalt lighthouse,” “lantern room,” “first fishing boats”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative pattern (vibration → scent → return) teaches itself early and tightens at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Lena’s final candle and exhalation reconfigure her endless building into an anchored, forward ritual; cost is the acceptance that the station will keep eroding while she keeps answering. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each call and map-layer thickens the density of loss until the patina itself seems to breathe. The patina bronze object cues and participates in the final beat, satisfying the 9+ cost-proof test. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (cliff-edge station, midnight, single POV), no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: burying the eye reweights “truth” itself—revelation becomes the new violence—at visible cost (he forfeits potential leverage). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mention of scent, soil, and storm adds density until the final image crystallizes option loss. Orientation is taught early (“the orchard hung like a broken chandelier…”) and pays off when the ravine swallows the secret. No causal breaks; every beat tightens the noose around honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the beam’s arc re-weights the premise—keepers are not hoarders but channels. Causal chain holds: because the boutonnière is preserved, therefore it can be returned; because Elias is last willing vessel, therefore he must release. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensate fragment layers until the final image crystallizes the social cost of endless memory inheritance. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) land by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: door seals, creek excluded, Elias accepts the sob-path—cost is the foreclosed safe life of maps. Causal chain—chip → ants → fissure → door—holds under the Causal lens. Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The motivating promise is revealed late, a mild structural gamble, yet payoff reweights prior beats cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she ignored the warning ∴ the grotto collects its debt, and because she kneels ∴ she is transfigured. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—her shadow on the wall is literally rewritten in crimson—so the price is on the page. Orientation is anchored by word 43 (“the ridge a jagged spine above the clouds”) and the pattern of returning dreams is taught early; no penalty. The final image reconfigures the throne’s meaning without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its lyrical pattern early (“suspended bridges glowing like veins”) and deepens by accretion until the shell’s glow is woven into clothes and ribs, reweighting the stake. Orientation is clean—who/where/when locked inside 50 words—so no penalty applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the jump-through-the-moment is a crystallized image whose cost is the forfeiture of the extraction paradigm; the conceptual price is legible in the city’s recognition-exhale. One causality wobble: the furnace-roar that roars “somewhere below” right after they jump feels like coincidence rather than consequence, blunting the tightening that would lift this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the scroll’s ash on the desk and the empty grave reconfigure the entire timeline-rule; cost is the audible scream of a thousand misquoted voices and the elder’s obliteration. Causal lens holds: every beat is “because/therefore” driven by scroll-handling (trace glyph → dream-revision → confrontation → surrender). No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 80 (“mountain ranger cabin”). Persistent constraint—the scroll’s mutating ink—shapes every tactic; its silence after immolation is the final price.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each object accumulates emotional density until the screw reweights meaning in the final beat. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias winds the clock while “measuring life in the weight of what people carry,” a crystallized stance whose cost is the perpetual absence of scent he has just accepted. Causality is intact: the screw arrives → memory → pedagogical gift → new metric for time/life. No orientation debt; fog, harbor, water-clock anchors are in by line 4. The persistent constraint—smell gone forever—shapes every micro-choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the platform descends, scars “sing,” and the storm’s held breath becomes her new language—felt cost is undeniable. Causality holds: each micro-shed (quill tip, frost lattice, feather) forecloses retreat and reweights the stake under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) crystallize within 50 words. The final image reconfigures meaning without exposition—publish-now caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty vial and sprouting tendrils reconfigure their options without erasing the orchard’s doom, cost fixed in the scent of sap and pavement. Causal chain holds—accusation → rupture → perfume → joint planting—each beat altering the next. One transition (archive to dawn) is crisp; orientation anchored by line 4. No lens ambiguity; the final hush satisfies the Accumulative/Textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: ship sight → key heat → Elias releases = because/therefore chain that reweights the premise. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: releasing the key forecloses reunion with the lost crew and leaves the notch in the bow as permanent price. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the black water vomit and the new notch—tangible, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: elliptical flashes build toward a single resonant reconfiguration—Lena trades hardware for permeability. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught in first 80 words; no penalty. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: red laser dot accepted into teal fungal net, crystallizing the new stance with felt conceptual cost—her life’s methodology abandoned. Persistent constraint—the cracked, untranslatable screen—literally shapes her exit, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s dying light fuses blue/gold paths into a subway-constellation that re-weights her world-rule "luck = readable code." Cost is legible in the cracked mica and burning palms; the new rhythm is felt, not lectured. Causal chain—scrawl→library→lantern choice→fractured exit—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each shard intensifies texture rather than twists plot. Orientation anchored within 120 w; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias coils the cord tight, a visible sealing of his vow to remain. The Accumulative lens holds—each wrong number layers density until the final note reweights the stake of endless repetition. Orientation is anchored within 50 words (“subway utility tunnel…folding chair”). Cost is legible in the candle stub’s reflection: he will keep paying in solitude. No causal break; the harmonica’s off-key hum is the because/therefore that lets the woman cry and lets him stay.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant is “breathing,” a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (“weight of small moments like a relic, like a weapon”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of steeping, ink, bloom repeats and tightens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality break. One shard, one transitionless scene meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each micro-exchange layers the reciprocity ledger until the rock’s final re-gift triggers a resonant reconfiguration. The causality is soft—Carter’s “cure = list of names” arrives as a bardic reveal—but the pattern is taught early and the closing image reweights loneliness as communal motion, paying conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stillpoint migrates inward, foreclosing further search with the ring’s cooling pulse as felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each absorbed note layers density until the final chord reweights the stake. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors (bark, loam, frozen constellations) are vivid by 120 words. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore, permissible under Accumulative/Textural track.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the soil—not the seeds—was wrong, reframing every prior “mistake” as layered data. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught by repeated unfolding images (ink, seeds, stars) and lands with undeniable cost—Elias pockets the vellum, walks toward bays he may still lose. Causality intact: anomaly’s sigh → unsolicited phrase → crystallized stance. No orientation debt; anchoring (who/where/when) delivered by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s silence is re-priced as *alive*, the camera’s heft the visible cost. Accumulative lens holds—each empty click layers density until the flash reweights the rule-set. Causality is clean: signing → waves rise → faceless thing unravels → camera drinks. No orientation debt; moon/tide anchors arrive by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s ash reweights “mercy” from sin to gift. Causal lens holds: each fire is because/therefore anchored to the promise. The tapestry’s whispered clue pays off the slashed-face map. Cost is unmistakable—empty pockets, unmarked hands—at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon’s surface holds “a sky that had never known grief,” a crystallized charged poise that reweights every prior memory-theft. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each drum-slap adds density until the pattern breaks into dissolution; the universe inhales with her, making the cost cosmic and felt. Orientation is taught by lyric disorientation early (no strict who-when anchors), then paid off by the mirrored sky image—waiver applies. No lens ambiguity; the final note is the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage is clean: storm scrambles compass ► maps rewrite ► woman appears ► coin offers a *quiet* counter-path; every step is because/therefore. Orientation locked by line 8 ("port city’s neon") within the 120-word guard; no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the slit-peel is not an exit but an *invitation* whose cost is the blank map—future navigation now unprinted. One micro-turn—metal sheet reveals new path—tightens stakes without breaking lens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirror on the windowsill reframes silence into listening, repricing both father and son with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: shutter rhythms and light nets tighten the stake (need to be seen without words) until the final star wink reweights the premise. No orientation debt; dock, guardian, boy located by line 40. Persistent constraint—the mirror’s return—shapes future tactics off-page yet is legible in the father’s softened posture.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the humming metal chains reweight the town’s perception of the library from “relic” to living circuit; cost is felt in council retreat and Elias’s anonymity. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural—pattern of quiet window installations intensifies until magnetic grotto reprises the image; transitions legible, pattern taught early, coherent at end. One shard, no orientation debt; prop track (pawn → filings → chains) never breaks; council retreat is off-page but the perceptual shift is on-page and undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: scrimshaw theft → carried guilt → whale-call summons → body answers → island-cage collapses. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Veyth’s disappearance rewrites the entire premise from landmass to prison, and the price is Elias’s human past dissolving in saltwater. The one micro-turn—carving slips from fingers—simultaneously frees whale and self, tightening stakes in a single beat. Orientation is anchored within 80 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence accumulates texture until scream breaks pattern. Closure is Charged Poise—scream swallowed by turbines, then shared bouquet—reconfiguring hush from imposed to chosen. Cost legible in “raw, ugly sound” and cracked mask. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: Mandate aftermath shapes every tactic; final image of split bouquet shows new social contract.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the lake’s mirror *answers*—a Conceptual Repricing that flips exile into authorship. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each spiral step thickens texture until the glyphs rewrite themselves. The “ban was never about keeping them out” reversal is earned by the humming quartz pattern taught from line 1. Orientation is swift; who-where-when anchored in first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final concertina note and clasped hands reconfigure stakes—Elias renounces sight, Liora renounces departure—cost is the thorn still in her palm. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of plant-messages + cracked vase + reed tongues tighten until the cracked-night image reweights imperfection as beauty. Orientation clean by line 3; transitions (dawn→evening→night) are legible shards under Track B. No lens ambiguity; closure cost legible in “Stay” / shoulder-brush / thorn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bell’s sound “unfolds” rather than travels, reweighting the premise that connection must be audible. The causal chain holds—lens → resonator → hum → bell → renunciation—each step a visible, textured consequence. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits external validation and embraces the unverifiable “space between.”

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the open curtain, candle-bearing crane, and stranger-to-strand diffusion of grief visibly reprice her prior silenced stance. Causality is accumulative/textural: each folded crane thickens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options (she can now teach/teach others). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 4; no penalty. The persistent cost—her relinquished monopoly on mourning—charges the final lens and satisfies the 9+ quick test, yet a hairline slip: the first black-feather return arrives off-stage, slightly diluting the on-page causality chain.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held to the last line: each returned card, each new measurement thickens the cultural sediment left by the crash. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Elias’s laugh reweights the entire premise: the game was never rigged, just written by someone; now he’ll rewrite. The cost is unmistakable in the brass click of the retracting tape counting down the next bubble. Orientation is immediate (loft, dawn, rain), causality intact, no loops or late rules.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the pagoda dissolves into light that conceptually reprices “to purify is to let go.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image adds density until the cadence shift—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s offer of her shadow crystallizes a new equilibrium—the poet’s hope is housed, the library breathes, Liora’s stance is permanently altered. Cost is legible in the final image: her “thin but present” shadow and the stone’s faint pulse. Causality is clean: the stone’s arrival → footage comparison → recognition → sacrifice. Accum/Textural lens holds throughout; each reprise of “softly deliberate” deepens the pattern rather than advances plot, and the final merging reweights the entire texture.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the translucent tail-tip reweights the whole moral ledger under the Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—because he withholds the real medicine, the con collapses; therefore each restorative act sheds a layer. Orientation is nailed in the first 30 words. The single lens holds; cost is visible in the apothecary’s silence and the locket he never retrieves. Reaches 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hourglass empties, the tower’s wounds stay open, Liora tunnels into question-bearing hush—cost is the ache she stops trying to decode. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frozen sand → thawing hiss → final run-out reweights the stake chronotope. Pattern taught early (frozen hourglass) pays off in last-line image. One causal tightening: archive file slides free, mother’s liver scar mirrored in Liora’s collar, forcing the pen stroke that forecloses closure-seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each reel touched adds density until the projector beam becomes the decisive reconfiguration—silence as Charged Poise with undeniable cost. Orientation anchor (“projection booth…rusted reels”) arrives by word 20; no debt. Closure is the exact moment the bulb dies and the dark speaks; no causal leap, only pattern culmination. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (the booth’s hungry dark) shapes every tactic and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine holds: star-path → archway → well → release, each beat pivoting on the brass instrument’s alignment. Closure lands with visible cost (“her body humming with the echo of a thousand unlocked stories”) and a persistent constraint (she is now the path). Lens is clearly accumulative/textural; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise: the green sand and ticking clock reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of blooming dunes / sparks / clock chimes accumulates until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is taught early by insistent lyric disorientation that later pays off, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: binary-leaves, fractal branches, gear-clicks layer into a cadence shift that reweights the stake from “understand the hum” to “become the hum.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the gear left glinting on the branch is a conceptual repricing—insight is no longer portable, it is ambient. Cost is visible in the relinquishing gesture; the lens holds without causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star-stamped ticket adds density until the un-stamped dusk itself becomes the final “ticket.” The punch’s release into the shallows is a decisive Charged Poise that reweights every prior crossing with the cost of choosing not to cross.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias hands over the bolt—Decisive Change—and chooses to stay, accepting the reopened sonic wound. Causal chain: bolt discovery → recognition → surrender → fortress answers. Orientation anchored early (fortress, snow, bellhop, 3rd-floor landing); no head-fake disorientation. Cost is visceral: air forgets silence, teacup shatters, Elias’s nerves re-fire, denoting irreversible shift under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each sigil acts as a because/therefore trigger that narrows Veythas’s options toward the final sundering. Closure is legible—his naming of Lirien splits the scepter and ends the lie—with conceptual cost etched into the dais inscription. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the library’s namelessness is purposeful disorientation that pays off in the stilling of drift. One minor causality bump: the pretender’s instantaneous relief feels slightly unearned because we never see his prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the station lights dying behind her while the road keeps humming reconfigures both world-rules and Lena’s stance with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern repetition (tide-gauge *clink-clank* morphs into road-pulse) reweights meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is anchored by word 90 (“station hummed”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. The only drag is the single paragraph of off-stage Collapse backstory; although under 20 % and anchored to the atlas page, it still momentarily pauses present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bay’s hum becomes a communal name, visible cost written in rust flakes and coughing engines. Causal chain: Lena’s palm → stones flare → glasses pass → scouts light up → ships lift; each beat tightens options under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors (“abandoned spaceport repair bay… margin of daylight”) arrive well before 120 w. One minor loop: “rebellion’s lull… forgotten how to listen” restates stakes twice; does not dull final image. Lens holds without ambiguity; qualifies for 8-band but lacks persistent constraint that would push 9.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.6)
    Causal lens: because she hears plants → disobeys Council → decodes kite → speaks name → amber opens → vines rebuild. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Council elder’s boot sings, forcing kneel. No teleporting props; kite symbols planted early, paid off in final flower script.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: salt wind, crumpled photo, cypress leaf accrue density until the final image reweights survival itself. Orientation anchors (Lena, cliff-side arboretum, present afternoon) appear by line 3; no ambiguity. Closure is a classic Charged Poise: photo suspended between earth and sea, leaf’s oil scent crystallizing the new stance—felt cost is the permanent loss of the static past. Causality is interior but coherent; each freeze/press ritual tightens the next, culminating in the release.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elara steps into the dark and releases the box, reweighting the premise from capture to self-canvas. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tarot fragment, shelf groan, and salt breath adds density until the final luminescent ache. Cost is felt in the body (“lighthouse exhaled… swallowed it entirely”), but the absence of a prior concrete stake-loss keeps the beat just shy of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is because/therefore—ink spill → pattern → threshold → disappearance. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Kael steps through, the spiral dissolves, and the twin clocks (one ticking, one stopped) re-weight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored in the first 50 words. Persistent constraint—his vein-altered blood—shapes the tactics at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: warm letter → keystroke → replication → bullets; each beat tightens options. Closure is Charged Poise—archives “speak back” with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no debt applied. The final martyr scroll is external confirmation; the protagonist’s decisive act is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she stays, the dome holds, the sandbag scrap becomes living suture—“a patch against the storm”—with conceptual cost (she forfeits escape). Causal lens holds: tower fall → airship wreck → ballast in dome → Liora’s choice to mend glass with cloth. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the fisher commands silence, reseals the sky, but forfeits the voice forever—cost is legible in blackened stems and the pocketed spike that “burned cold.” Causal chain holds: because he voices silence twice, the mouth obeys and the constellations snap back. Orientation is taught lyrically—garden, dock, forge—never breaking the accumulative lens. One micro-turn suffices; no beat is redundant; pattern taught early (soil hums → final hush) pays off in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lattice holds: because the journalist doubts → Lydia audits → plates arrive → she rewrites tomorrow’s front page. Orientation locked by word 80; observatory acoustics anchor who-where-when. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the *Chronicle*’s integrity reborn, her father’s myth burned. One hairline slip: the tin box arrives via off-stage stranger, a micro-convenience that keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: she refuses further erasure, accepts the cry forever, and the cost is audible—the mosquito wings now “singing,” the ledger permanently open. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second sentence and never loosens: each recycled sound thickens the guilt-density until the final cadence shift releases it into rain-like static. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“The laboratory hummed…”) and the payoff justifies any early disorientation. One persistent constraint—the firmware’s remembered cries—shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: flake whisper → mandala test → void hand-dive → village chorus released; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unfinished square-mural re-weights meaning for the whole village, cost visible in the child’s first illicit line. Orientation clean by word 80; mist, grotto acoustics, present-tense chalk place us immediately. One micro-soft spot: the elders’ fear is asserted, not dramatized, so the societal stakes feel slightly grafted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine holds: each name spoken → tessera answers → plaza rewrites itself; the commander’s surrender is the decisive change, paid for by the shared kneeling and the dropped sword. Orientation is secure by line 4 (“Beneath the shattered sky… Elias knelt”). The lens is causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the stand-off. Cost is legible in the final image: “the cracks filled with gold” — a permanent, irreversible memorial that will draw reprisal.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Lydia’s fade-out and Elias’s forward step reconfigure possibilities with felt cost to her. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; repetition of orchard echoes and coin reprises tightens meaning until the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when is signaled by line 3 and paid off by the garden’s rule-set at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static shock → geode arrival → somatic sequence → wall-breathing → painting a door, each beat thickens texture and reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the door pulsing “like a heartbeat” reconfigures options—she could still step through, but the painted light and cat in her arms manifest the cost of choosing to stay and remember. The final image (“the light remembered”) lands with undeniable conceptual cost under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the fossil lifts, amber pulse locks the new cartography, rain starts—world re-priced as now-speakable. Causal linkage holds: because leaf warms → cave answers → Lior accepts voice-cost. Orientation anchor (cave mouth, post-hibernation) lands by line 3. No lens break; accumulative texture builds to final re-weighting. Cost is undeniable—“skin prickling” rain is the price of staying awake.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—buttons, jars, whispers layer like sediment—then crystallizes meaning when the hourglass reverses, a Charged Poise that reweights all prior texture. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical: the ninth button’s retrieval doesn’t “solve” but reconfigures the prophecy, letting time itself spill backward. Orientation is anchored by ~70 words; disorientation would serve no closure purpose, so no penalty applies. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: communal time is no longer Elias’s to govern; the ledger’s code is obsolete the instant sand flows uphill.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine holds: message in snow → arrival → pillbox key → choice to go. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—she takes the key, leaves the empty pillbox, forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the relinquished relic and the footprints that can’t be recalled. Orientation is secured by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of fog lifts + gutter silence = crossing signal. Closure is a Charged Poise—needle passed, coachman drives on—reconfiguring the promise from personal talisman to communal relay. Causality is clean: parchment rule → two fog lifts → silent gutters → go. Cost is legible in the final image: girl lost to mist, coachman forever courier of someone else’s key.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the glowing bowl left in the fractures crystallizes the stake—memory versus erasure—with undeniable felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (honey ghost, kiln light, thrum) deepens the same dominant stake rather than chaining causal “therefores.” Orientation is swift—potter, ruined oasis, present drought—by line 4. The kiln’s final heat and the bowl’s inner light serve as the cadence shift that reweights meaning under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the two gauge teeth in dirt reweight “locked vs. free” with undeniable conceptual cost—she stays, heart open, no longer needing the lock. Causal chain holds: gauge teeth → scoring soil → shared gift → open-door final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. Micro-turn is the smooth tooth offered, tightening options. Cost is felt in the “quivering hush” that becomes “something like hope” on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial drinks the feather, the hum softens, and Lior’s stance flips from haunted to unapologetically alive—cost legible in the "brittle awakening" that no longer hurts. Causal chain holds: reflection-split → book of mirrors → insight → surrender of penance. Orientation is taught by line 4; no lens ambiguity at exit. One causal leap (book appears from nowhere) is genre-consistent and waived.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the second spiral’s release reweights the premise—possession → offering—with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the image of dissolving orbs carries the price. Causality is internal-pattern rather than external event, valid under the lens. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“floating walkway”), transitions are legible, no props teleport. The ending earns its stasis: she leaves with emptier pockets and a fresh sheet, the thread now externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the signal taunts campus fractures, Liora therefore retaliates with subsonics, which in turn forces the alien pattern to modulate from predatory to curious. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing—“I was just fixing the radio” reweights the entire power struggle under a new, wry rule-set. Cost is legible in her exile status and the building’s unsettled bones. No orientation or telegraphing issues; anchors arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: compass puncture → slab unfolds → descent → key theft → spatial mutiny → key redeems city. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options and raises bodily risk. Closure delivers a Decisive Change with felt cost: the city’s blueprint breathes while Elias keeps the now-warm compass, his claustrophobia unpaid—an earned constraint. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quarry keeps its secrets, but Elias now carries an undeniable witness-cost signaled by the ribbon brushing his fingertips. Causal chain holds—ribbon arrival → descent → lance resonance → echo confrontation → sealed memory → forward motion. Orientation is swift; the mist-mouth image anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity; accumulative density tightens once when the lance brands the memory into metal, reweighting the stake from “unsolvable” to “silently carried.”

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: find box → decode verses → copper nail → breach glass → glimpse alternate fleet → lose nail → burn journal/door feeling. Each because/therefore linkage tightens options until the final refusal to chase. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sky as waiting door reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The cost is legible in the ashes he smells and the hush Liora shares.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the pixel-road rewrites the rule-set and the fiddle becomes song-body. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each left-behind artifact layers density until the glass flake tips scale. The “threshold not rest-stop” reconfig meaning is legible and final. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—“the song was hungry.”

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lira in pocket and cigarette drop crystallize “leaving as proof,” reweighting the past without sentimental loss. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each shard (office, desk, cage, dusk) deepens the pattern of circling back until the stance shift lands. Cost is felt in the final image; the father’s spiral aphorism is the only slightly abstract node, but it is anchored by Elias’s prior micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mosaic of four shards (domes, desk, lens, dawn) is taught by the first 25 % and coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density to the “shared burden” pattern. The decisive Charged Poise lands when the thread spools through Elias and the ledger vanishes—visible cost is the dissolution of his hoarded words. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored in first 60 words). One causal micro-turn: pressing palm to telegram → ink warms → glyphs shift, narrowing his path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: stolen seed → plant → brother rises → truth swallowed → key offered, each step a because/therefore narrowing Eldrin’s moral options. The failed trick is the motivated ellipsis that seeds the vortex’s laugh and the plant’s hunger, paid off when the lake screams in recognition. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the key reweights “drowning” into “choosing,” forcing Eldrin to shoulder complicity. Cost is legible in the final image—warm key vs. cold lake—crystallizing the permanent shift in his vocation from finder to keeper of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: every maze twist is triggered by scar-pain, clipping contact, or elder-Liora’s warning, tightening options until the bridge seals. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 6 and is re-anchored after each hedge shift; no penalty. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the covenant stays eclipsed but Liora’s stance is re-configured—her scars glow, the leaf roots behind her ear, cost felt without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the white flower replaces the card, guilt re-priced as scar, cost smelled in “rain on dry earth.” Causal lens holds—each stitch tightens options until the root “pulls” the hidden name. Orientation is secure by line 15. No teleporting props; the card’s ashes are literally sewn and vanished. The persistent constraint is the orchard’s tithe system, which shapes every tactic and forecloses escaping unscathed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the road ahead reweighted by the cloth in pocket, uncertainty now space-between-notes rather than failure. Causal chain holds—cloth cue → memory → refusal to appraise → drive off—each beat narrows options under lens of accumulative resonance. Orientation clear by line 3; no penalty. Cost legible in final image: headlights cutting dark, quarry applause fading—applause itself priced as expendable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the inverted Arbor’s blooming flower reweights the entire premise, letting Elias inhabit both love and loss simultaneously. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of “transition” imagery and magnetic micro-choices thickens until the world literally tilts—so the final image’s cost is felt as a bending rather than a causal punch. Orientation is secure by line 4; no teleporting props or late rule changes; the seed’s physics is seeded early and paid off in the bloom. Persistent constraint: the Arbor’s magnetic pull hums throughout, shaping every tool and bodily gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the spoon’s trembling drop of light is a Resonant Reconfiguration—tomorrow restored as consumable ephemera—whose conceptual cost is felt. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every shard adds density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is swift (glass ceiling, brass dials) and the single transition (door-gust) is legible. The ledger’s prior function is slightly under-cued, so the causal leap to “you’re already in the creel” registers as poetic rather than materially foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shell deepens pattern and reweights stakes until the pearl’s crown dissolves the bunker/world barrier. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of spreading sky-light—paid for by her vanished pearl and abandoned name. Orientation is clean by line 5; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the right turn forecloses the path of perpetual penance and is paid for by the day’s walk and the silence of the dried riverbed. Causality holds: every beat (stopping meds, reading graffiti, taking the bellows, walking the tracks) is a because/therefore link that narrows options until the final image. The lens is causal throughout; no retroactive patches. Cost is legible in the last line—“For the first time in years, he didn’t look back”—where the price is the permanent relinquishing of the map and the sister’s gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the library’s amber glow, mist, and collapsing shelves accrete until the blank page in her sleeve becomes the decisive reconfiguration. Causality is lyric, not mechanical—each tick of the reversed watch thickens the texture of unspoken words until the final image (silent watch on sill) crystallizes the cost. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (impossible heights, mist swallowing path) is taught early and pays off in the folding library. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the library’s erasure makes her own veils irreversible currency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure: she smashes the violin—Decisive Change with conceptual cost (forfeits payment, invites outlaw status). Lens: Accumulative/Textural—image-density reweights stakes until the garden sings. Causality: coffee vision → violin whisper → propagation act; no off-stage cheats. Orientation locked by 40 words; moon-clock tightens to midnight.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the doorway dissolves but the static is “tuned to a new frequency,” reweighting stillness from wall to bridge. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each aurora shiver, breath pattern, and static code fragment layers until the mirror threshold appears. Orientation is anchored within 120 words via body, ledge, grotto, and aurora. The only minor slack: the chip’s rule-set is revealed rather than foreshadowed, but this is taught in-scene and paid off by the dull-green final image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative lens: the grotto sequence deepens pattern rather than causal reversals. Hairpin → soil → shoot → fruit lands a Conceptual Repricing: grief is re-carved as cradle, cost paid in the dissolution of the heirloom and the tremor that recoils vines. Closure is legible, felt, and completes the spiral image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reweights his lens from warning beam to invitation, accepting doubt with felt social cost—he waves to the smuggler, forfeiting moral purity. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each unraveled thread peels off borrowed guilt until only his voice remains. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—now a pulsing, questioning light—shapes the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pond’s memory reweights the premise, and the cost is the continuing backward shave of his years (“sixty-two now”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stones/ripples deepens meaning—but the story is still a single reflective loop; no causal turn inside the present scene narrows options further.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the skimmer’s shift from passive listener to active anchor reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens—the flock’s re-harmonization is the cadence shift that makes the cost legible. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3; canyon, twilight, bone towers instantly legible. Causality holds: because he endures stillness, the Hollow Maw passes unsated. One soft spot: the Maw’s “ripple of wrongness” is slightly abstract, but the beat still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because the candle won’t quit, therefore Marlin climbs; because he touches the keystone, therefore the spire flips into summer; because he hears the keeper, therefore he chooses un-mastery. One clear transition (summit mist) is legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the candle & keystone merge into living shadows that re-price “explanation” itself—felt cost is the chuck of authority he walks away from.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the frozen-sky lantern scene reweights every prior drowned-book image, and the cost is the irreversible substitution of Elias’s perception for reality. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory hue builds until the final ink-bleed dissolves the boundary between world and self. No orientation debt; anchoring (salt-crusted deck, festival below) is secure by line 40. One minor causality fuzz: why the key tag fits a door inside the wreck is unexplained, but the lyric pattern absorbs the glitch without breakingclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the observatory reset and single note reconfigure the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—“the universe that had not yet decided to begin.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (coins smooth, static resolves) reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught by word 30 (“universe that had already contracted”) so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a Charged Poise: the reaper pockets the now-blank atlas into the hollow where a heart should be, a literal Cost that fuses tool and body while the newly-named monsters ascend. Causality holds: because he named them, they become real; therefore he must walk on, shadow lengthening with a thing that “had not forgotten.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each fear-crystal added thickens the density until the final cadence reweights the world. One hairline slip: the atlas’s warning is disembodied voice rather than a beat anchored in physical cause, but the resonance still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias studies drip rhythms → therefore retunes bell → bay revives. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—sealing the fracture with a “vow kept” and foreclosing his old outsider stance. Orientation anchored by word 30; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Persistent constraint: the bell’s newly sealed seam remains a fragile weld, shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the burning photos re-weight memory from burden to buoyant current. Causal linkage holds throughout—each photograph nailed/burned tightens Elias’s stance until the final image of lifting hands. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no disorientation. Cost is legible in the sinking bottle and the ashes swirling into parental hands—felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the valley of glass trees and blue-flame door crystallize a before/after with felt cost—she forfeits footprints and the old orchard. Causal chain holds: crystal + fire → transit → door, all on-page. The starling epiphany (“equations only the sky could solve”) is the motivating pivot, but the transit itself is slightly abstract; the physical rules of the passage are implied rather than constrained, a hairline slip under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the city wakes to *“absence of a disaster it never knew was coming,”* a reconfiguration of meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (arbor, spores, buckle, radio static) tightens until the final image reweights trust itself. Causality holds: each beat—radio cue, muscle-memory revision, silent descent—flows *because/therefore* to the landing. The Orientation Test is waived; initial mist-disorientation is taught early and pays off in the final shimmer of spores.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the jars exist and custody looms, therefore he bleeds to merge. Each beat tightens options—arrival of second jar, threat of judicial dissolution, act of blood—until the Schism knits and history halts. Closure lands on-page: “the valley’s echoes didn’t change” is the audible cost, proving the merge rewrote reality. Minor warp: timeline of “three days” is announced then ignored; no tactical use of the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of quiet arrivals, failed solves, seed cracks, bloom stench tightens the dominant stake—keeping a space open for wonder. Closure is Charged Poise: “Now we see what grows” reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality intact—seed’s warmth → puzzle shift → community vigil → bloom → hand-hold. No orientation debt; transitions legible across months in two-shard design.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the blower is left pointing upward like an accusation, the household now produces its own laughter—an unmistakable before/after shift with felt cost to Elias’s identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each burst of off-key air thickens pattern until the engine’s death breaks it, forcing stance crystallization. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“mouth of the echo chamber”). Causality remains intact; no coincidence resolves the grief. Cost is legible in the final image—his fingers trembling, the empty tunnel—satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of thawing/unraveling intensifies rather than causal chains. Orientation is secured by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the thirsty light swallows her and reweights “boundaries of light” with undeniable conceptual cost—she pays with self-dissolution. Pendant hand-off is the visible beat that triggers the final image; cost is legible in the dissolving ground and her laughter of terror.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the healed crozier and glass petal garden reweight the rule-set—destruction is now generative, destiny interruptible. Causal chain holds: because he feeds the crozier doubt, therefore the nexus un-makes wounds and re-makes possibility. Persistent constraint—the crozier’s second heartbeat—shapes the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the dish’s groan → shard’s hum → city’s song form a tightening crescendo that reweights silence from absence to presence; the final image of reversed gravity is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the cost of un-learning undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: rising sand and sealed grotto reweight the rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern repetition (starlight, hourglass, radio) tightens until the cadence snap. Causality intact: hourglass fed over years pays off in the merge; no late rule changes. Cost is legible—“I remember both lives”—and persistent constraint (ferry still transient) shapes future.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens governs: density of woven moments escalates until the gallery’s “quiet eruption” reweights perception. Orientation is swift; by line 3 we know who/where/when and the disorientation is taught, not accidental. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias takes the woman’s hand while the thread reforms—conceptual cost legible, but the earlier causality (“they’re coming to dismantle it”) evaporates without on-page consequence, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the horizon is re-conceived as spiral, chain link re-weighted from anchor to ascension key, cost paid in elders’ resistance and the city’s tremor of identity. Causal chain—curiosity → chain test → chalk map → students’ uptake—holds without ellipses. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear inside 120 words and are spatially tracked through the Spire ledge and fungal light. No teleporting props; the rusted link is carried, slotted, warmed. The final beat is an image, yet it forecloses “the abyss as terminus” path with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph reappears in his palm with the child’s face now clear, reweighting his professional identity under the dead’s claim. Causal chain holds: curiosity → follow signal → touch glove → witness → accept witness role. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty. One shard, single POV, one tightening beat; cost is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias exits bearing the invisible drop, his life re-tuned to the drowned archive. Causal chain holds: codex margin → phase seam → junction box → carried droplet, each step paid for with rising physical/psychic risk. Orientation anchors by line 4, well inside the 120-word guardrail. The “because/therefore” linkage is intact; the facility remembers because he forced it to surface, and the tide-time gate cleanly limits return options.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the static flips from threat to shared pulse, reweighting her life-as-error into life-as-medium. Causal lattice holds: because the radio died, the voice arrives; because she fears the count stopping, she obeys “defragment”; because she accepts, the shard dulls and the snow outside re-patterns. Orientation is rock-solid—opal dome, 11:47 PM, frost-laced window—anchored inside 50 words. No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural drive taught early via aurora-heartbeat-ink motif holds to the final choral hum.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon reclaims its last translator, language dies, and the starlings inherit the script—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric but coherent: each breath into the diamond tightens the noose of echo, culminating in the towers’ answering song. Orientation is swift—Canyon of Endless Echoes by line 3—and the single-scene window holds. The turn from passive recording to active answer is the decisive tightening; the story could use one more beat of her conscious yes, but the ending image reweights all prior matter.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden absorbs Elias and reconfigures the stake from rescue to participation in the joke. Causal chain holds: arrowhead → phone → seed → garden claim; each step because/therefore. Cost is felt—“the garden swallowed him whole” with visible forfeiture of human form. Minor causal fuzz: phone’s prior existence in loam is revealed only at ring moment, but this does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: statues melt into rooted soil, bridge cables give way to locust wings—conceptual repricing of mechanical world into living one, cost legible in the vanished sentinels and her aching arms. Accumulative lens holds: each image (brass gears, petal, shell) layers until pattern breaks with green shoot. Orientation anchored by line 4 (“rusted cables,” “enchanted orchard below”). No telegraphing; final hush is earned. Minor waiver: “she whispered” line edges toward overt thematic echo but is saved by locust shell’s prior weight.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a charged poise: Elias steps through the median carrying the storm, a visible Conceptual Repricing of the border rule-set. Causal links hold—because he survives the delivery, therefore the border’s authority is symbolically punctured. The bottle’s stillness in the haunted post office supplies felt cost. One minor scaffold: “again. And again.” could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: silence re-priced as generative, halo pulsing in palm = visible cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of echo, dust, chime—tightening through sensory repeats until final cadence shift. Orientation waived: disorientation taught early by “shouldn’t exist” car and repaid in mirror expansion. No causal break; only mild late-rule wobble when woman fades without foreshadow.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scarf dissolves into the library itself, reweighting the premise—memories are not hoarded but inhabited. The causal chain is lyric but legible: scarf → hyperbolic reading → library reconfigured. Orientation is swift (“odd-hour librarian,” “scientific poetry library” by line 2). Cost is felt in the scarf’s vanishing and Elias’s acceptance of perpetual fold-status. Meets 9+ quick test but for a hairline slack in causal tightening mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the palette flares, the footprint half-erased by tide reweights the rule-set—dreams once catalogued can now walk free, and the librarian forfeits her custodial certainty. Causal lattice holds: each sunrise exposure narrows possibility until the final “Stay” forecloses return. Orientation is lyric-taught: “whispering archipelago still hummed with the hush of improbable beginnings” cues the reader to accept disorientation that pays off in the final salt-damp echo. The cost is palpable in the empty beach and dew-filled palette—no sentence where it is not legible.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly with conceptual repricing: “the greatest secrets…enveloped you” re-weights the premise under an accumulative/textural lens; the lens is taught early and the ribbon-map beat crystallizes options with felt cost. One causal micro-gap: the man’s vanish is accepted rather than caused, but it occurs post-closure and doesn’t rupture the because/therefore chain that drives the stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (mushroom glow, stone map flare, sky groan) tightens options toward the star-repair climax. Closure—Elias re-knits the constellation at the cost of confronting the eater—lands with visible price (ring crumbles, memory weight returns). Orientation anchored by line 3 (“sunken orchard”), pattern taught early. One micro-turn: thief = friend; reversal complicates but does not resolve, satisfying coincidence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “reversible exile” rule is taught early and paid off when annotation binds the shadow; the ending attains Charged Poise (map glows, options reconfigured) with cost legible in Kael’s tea-smudged fingers. Causality is causal under lens: because Elspeth annotates space, therefore the door is sealed—no arbitrary leaps. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3 and holds. One minor scaffold: “the kind of quiet that makes people lean in” tells the already-shown hush, but this loop does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the silver sapling outside + the villagers’ iridescent eyes reweight the rule-set with undeniable social cost. Causal链路 holds: because Elias gives the seed and paints the girl, therefore the veil allows return and a new tree exists. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in the single line “Elias—finally let himself wonder what might grow him,” a path now foreclosed to rest.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the dropped needle + wrist-wrapping reweights “mending” into “opening” with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure mounts via image density (splintered rainbows → shattered prisms) rather than causal chain. The final image of Elias as “a door” crystallizes the new stance without exposition. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors (altar, harbor, starlight) are legible by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the map becomes key, the silence becomes presence, the tear becomes threshold. Cost is legible in the image “no proof, only the quiet certainty.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of three films, three dawns, three seasons—culminating in cadence shift: “the vault exhaled.” Orientation anchor (vault beneath cathedral) arrives within 60 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis—she lies and pockets the notebook, paying the cost of silence—but the missing Orientation Test (who/where not anchored until after p.1) slightly blurs the lens, and the Electra’s “holes from something passing through” is a late rule change not seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the broken-line “rest” literally rewrites the courtyard’s graffiti OS, turning the entire premise—code as haunting—into a visible, felt shutdown. Causal lens holds: because he answers the ghost’s spiral-question with a rest-symbol, therefore the code unravels and the mist inverts. Persistent constraint: the radio crackles on, implying the next child-cycle has already begun. Cost is legible in the empty chalk and the print-less stone.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the same ice that imprisoned her now “burns” with refracted star-fire, reweighting the rule-set at undeniable visual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every numbered temperature/date intensifies the final rainbow burst. Orientation is clean—elevator floor counting anchors who/where/when by line 5. No teleporting props; diary, goggles, and frost trace forward to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the light-thread stitches gondola to sky while Elias accepts unbroken belonging; cost is the literal fall and figurative erasure of distance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of cloud-emotion cataloguing intensifies until the sky answers. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The single shard satisfies scope; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each beat layers density—failed portraits, coin indentations, glass cuts—until the collapsing beam refracts the sky, a cadence shift that reweights the whole quest. Causal linkage is present but subordinate: the coin’s spiral dictates the sun channels; the oak’s death schedules her finish. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sky inside walls shatters, proving the limit, and she “lets the limits hold her.” Cost is legible in the warped, indentation-less coin and the sap on her pillow—proof the tree’s death has entered her body.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the hopscotch grid’s light snaps into alignment and engines roar, making the before/after legible. The cost is the crew’s weeks of drift and Liora’s trespass risk. Causal linkage holds: each starling loop → phrasebook clue → grid sketch → physical jump → engine restart. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the watch-hands inside the pocket watch re-weight “time’s absence,” making the sister’s return legible as both gift and cost. Causal lens holds: each gear-slot tightens because/therefore logic until the water-mirror yields the watch. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“spiral staircase upward”) and 120-word mark is met. Cost is unmistakable in the final beat—“the watch warm against her ribs” externalizes the price of turning back time. Persistent constraint: the lunar eclipse rule shapes every tactic and is obeyed at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the nebula becomes communal labor, not escape, and the warm bell + chalked “We stay” make the reweighting legible. Causality is soft-lyric (Accumulative/Textural): each chalk message and bell-ring adds density rather than narrows options, but the final image crystallizes the accrued pattern cleanly. Orientation is swift—arches, orchard, ghost arrive by line 6—so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sets the puppet head into the clock’s maw, the beam collapses inward, and the hush *sings*—a conceptual repricing that turns the clock from countdown to breath. Cost is unmistakable: his own thread is forfeited, the hands stop forever, and the lighthouse beam never again wounds the dusk. The causal lens holds throughout—because he inserts the head, therefore the stolen minutes unspool—and the lyric pattern taught in sentence one pays off in the mirrored final cadence. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final nut pressed into dirt reconfigures the labyrinth from trap to potential door, with the cost felt in her return to cursed solitude. Causal lattice holds: blueprint discovery → years of nut trials → exception for girl → last nut withheld → future promise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within first 100 words. One persistent constraint—mechanical birds locked by frost—shapes the tactical timing of every move. Lens (Causal) holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens: every beat flows “because/therefore” from the found chrysalis to the riverbank release. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (water’s edge, present-tense kneeling). The Decisive Change—he relinquishes the last relic and steps into the current—carries unmistakable cost: the cold bite, the pocket now empty, the sister’s scar finally un-housed. No prop teleport; chrysalis, boots, notebook trace cleanly. Closure image (“where the ravine’s paths became one”) reweights the opening premise that separation is failure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fracture on the slate reweights the premise—stories start in silence, not inscription—at visible cost (the traded moonlight, the patron’s hunger). Causal chain holds: incise-listen-trade-fracture; no teleporting props. Orientation is swift and tethered to Liora’s counter; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) stays coherent as density and cadence tighten into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens: each sensory memory adds weight until the single act of pouring reverses the tide; the final “couldn’t taste a thing” is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; causal chain (ingest→refine→return→release) never breaks. No plot amnesia; vial, knife, pavilion track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is clean: the weight’s restoration + multilingual ledger arrival create a Conceptual Repricing of the elevator as a polyglot spine rather than a monolith. Causality is sequential—steal→engrave→return→ledger appears—each step shrinking options and raising social cost under a Causal lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 4; no penalty. The “borrowed starlight” motif and clock-tower geography are taught early and repay in the final image, so no lens ambiguity. The only hairline slip is the off-stage genesis of the translation ledger (appears ‘found’), but because it is the community’s answer to the weight’s prompt, the causality thread holds.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the canyon, mirror, and moon merge into one reconfiguring image that makes the entanglement irrevocable; cost is conceptual (she is now “cartographer of the entangled dark”) but undeniably felt. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each mirror-tilt accretes alien memories until identity folds; because/therefore links are present yet subordinate to density shifts—valid under Accumulative lens. One causality micro-slip: the nanite mechanics are declared, never constrained (no limit, backfire, or battery), so the final beat rests on an unchallenged super-power.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed in ash reweights the entire quest, making her future return inevitable with felt cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light, seed, and inversion culminates in the final reconfiguration. Causality holds: doodle → grotto → chamber → seed, each step triggered by her active choice. The inversion hour rule is taught early and governs tactics; no orientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias leaves the insulator behind, crystallizing the grove as living instrument. Cost is legible in the salt-clouded ceramic and his numbed fingers. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure mounts through pattern and cadence until meaning is repriced. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the worry-stone transfer crystallizes a new covenant between tutor and child, foreclosing Elias’s exile-loops with unmistakable emotional cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of gaps, pauses, magnetic shimmer accumulates until silence is re-weighted into breathable beauty. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“edge of the magnetic nexus”). No causality breaks; every beat enlarges the silence rather than explains it. Final image of the board “remembering how to breathe” recharges all prior gap-talk without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Elias’s shift from passive cataloguer to active re-builder is legible in the sign “Silence repaired here” and the open diary on the bench—Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Causal linkage holds throughout: the locked clasp → frequency device → diary map → fireworks trigger → guild ruins → new stall; each beat tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; pattern of elision (vibrations not words) is taught early and pays off at closure. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bridge strung with corpse-flower vines reweights “wisdom” into communal trust; cost is the irrevocable sharing of once-forbidden scent. Causal chain (seed theft → bloom → mirror → bridge) holds under Causal lens; each beat tightens options. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Final image reuses “sway” now charged with embrace, not threat—persistent constraint shaping future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the seed becomes a singing sapling, resilience is re-defined as something grown, not found, and the arrow’s dust is the felt price. Causal chain holds: inversion hum → arch fracture → moss/seed discovery → sapling birth → arrow forfeiture. No orientation debt; planet rules taught through flight and water reversal before they matter. Final image reweights mentor quest and planet lore in one compressed beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city itself is now a learning predator and she abandons the patch—cost is the symbolic surrender of past certainty. Causal chain intact (survey → flare → wind recoils → labyrinth exhales). Orientation beats arrive before 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the aurora stays, the cavern thaws, Liora steps into a new status quo. Cost is visible—amber sheet reduced to dust, elders’ authority voided, her own exile implicit. Causal lens holds: each chime escalates because she chooses liberation over control. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“At its heart stood Liora…”) and again at ~100 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each flute note thickens quiet density until the hush itself becomes the decisive pivot. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; the fissure image at line 9 teaches the pattern. Closure is Charged Poise—Elias stepping across with child’s fingers on his sleeve—reconfiguring the stake from seal to surrender; cost is the guardianship abdication visible in the uncased flute left behind. No causal gaps; driftwood realignment is the single micro-turn that pays off spatially and symbolically.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by line-1 sensory density, held to final “stars speak in feelings.” Closure is Charged Poise: the sky rewritten by every borrowed heart, Elias reconfigured as listener—cost is the irreversible dissolution of his emotional anonymity. Pattern of star vanish → return tracks the reweighting. No orientation debt; anchors clear within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bridge germinates, the courier becomes the hum, and “wonder is something you carry” is re-priced from object to transmission. Causal lens holds: because the woman crushes a seed, the vine sings, the pendant burns, and the courier’s role flips. Cost is unmistakable—he walks off the bridge into myth, forfeiting personal return. Orientation is clean within 30 words; transitions are lyric, not linear, but taught by aurora/abyss repetition and paid off when the fade accepts him.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism shatters, frost melts, and Elias walks away lighter yet exiled from proof—cost is legible in the empty pocket and the arbor’s “settling of old debts.” Causal chain holds: prism warms → vision → recognition → throw → silence. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“quartz arbor… dawn”), well under the 120-word cap. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silver dust on the absent lover’s palm reweights the rule-set—communication across worlds is possible but only at the price of permanent separation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence is accreted into material, then into tapestry, then into dust; the final image crystallizes options with undeniable cost. Persistent constraint (sender must stay) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of silk, orchard, and floating arches thickens texture until the final cadence reweights the stake—resilience is no longer abstract but materially sung in the anvil. Closure is a Charged Poise: the forge-fire image crystallizes the new covenant, cost legible in the vanished silk and the villagers’ bridges that now demand upkeep. Causality of “listening→planet answers” is lyrical but patterned early and consistent; no off-stage cheats. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“orchard’s twin suns”); spatial track clean throughout descent/re-ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s choice to step through the seam reconfigures both her identity and the story’s rule-set (“she was the map now”) with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: shard triggers recognition → seam redirection → choice to stop looking → shard bifurcates → passage. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt; no artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every return of glass, stone, letter tightens the same dominant stake—can safety be bottled/shared? Closure is Charged Poise: candle in spiral, tower breathes, skiff abandoned—cost (no exit) made legible in final image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (skiff, lantern room, dock) track cleanly. Causality intact: each artifact re-weights options until staying becomes inevitable. Earned, visible, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the false dawn breaks, the beam holds, Liora walks away already indentured to the next ascent; the lighthouse groan and the ozone promise make the cost visceral. Causal linkage is tight—each wick twist tightens the reflection path that cages the shadows, and her accidental prophecy is the irreversible trigger. Orientation is clean within 40 words; no teleporting props. Under 800 words, one meaningful tightening suffices: the moment she lets the flame “dip toward drowning” forecloses the option of perpetual green light and signs the bargain in spent oil.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the tea-house silence becomes invitation, the heart’s rhythm is finally his own, and the cost is the dissolved wing—irreversible, felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each dyed image adds density until the final moment reweights silence as freedom. Causality is intact: because he gives the stories away, he loses the wing and inherits the beat. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror’s ripple reconfigures Elias’s stance—he will keep patching, but now knowingly as a conduit, not an owner. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical return (trees absorb, labyrinth sighs) tightens the emotional density until the final image of “branches heavy with stars” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causality remains intact: because he unfolds the sextant’s grief, therefore the labyrinth accepts the transfer and his hands lighten. One hairline slip: “By dawn, the pieces would be gone” projects a future we don’t see; momentarily blunts the poise.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each trapped shard, quivering leaf, and returned harmony layers density until the greenhouse itself becomes a tuning fork. Closure is a Charged Poise: the villagers’ entry crystallizes a new communal option while Liora’s outstretched hands show the price—her voice is spent, her keeper identity ceded. The first gold vein in the split leaf is the visible cost that reweights the world-rule. Pattern taught early (memory → shard → song) pays off in the final dissolve of mica, no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: invitation → hidden staircase → mirrored confrontation → annotated thesis → lock the door. Each beat tightens options; the midnight deadline and unlocked rule create persistent constraint. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—she can no longer hide. One transition (bookcase swing) is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught by sentence-level patterning: repeated “uncloaking” images (bread steam, wheat riot, weeping guards) tighten the stake—how quickly the city stops adjusting. Closure lands via Charged Poise: wheat swaying where fountain stood reconfigures meaning with undeniable social cost. Persistent constraint visible: once wheat roots, no return to prior denial possible. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no teleporting props; causality held by sensory cue chain.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sampled vow adds density until the bridge appears as a pattern break. Closure is a Charged Poise: the kept vow reconfigures meaning with felt cost—the library’s erasure. Orientation is secure by line 3; spatial anchors hold. The slight causal hiccup is that the woman’s prior ledger cameos are never explained, but the final image overrides the need for literal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens is rock-solid: each beat tightens because/therefore—fob → routes offered → false ledger → betrayal moment → market justice. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “some debts weren’t meant to be paid in coin” reweights the entire truce-of-hush rule-set with undeniable social cost. The missing-bodies mystery is solved and paid for in the same beat the harbor claims Veyne; persistent constraint (market law of silence) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the compass needle dissolves and re-points at her chest, reweighting the rule-set so that “the world had always been a map” now demands she be read. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the escalation is a single cadence shift—every lavender stem bending *into* her—rather than causal reversals, satisfying the lens guardrail. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3, aurora-time signaled immediately. Cost is unmistakable: the ring’s gone, her shadow stretches without light, and the air “brushes back,” each image a non-refundable price.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wall becomes a door, the lock stays discarded, and the smudges on the ladder reweight all prior monochrome choices with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds: because every recalled memory tightens the dial, the painting splits, the tubes appear, and Elias paints—no external coincidence required. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (crystal cave, lantern light, charcoal). Persistent constraint—the lock’s discarded teeth—shapes the final image and prevents return.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    A causal lattice is locked tight: trait → fragment discovery → map assembly → Archive descent → writing act → plate erasure. Each beat is a because/therefore linkage whose cost escalates on the body (stiffening near lies, bleeding on metal, lungs finally “lighter”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the map was never a route to treasure but a key that dissolves once the tongue unlocks its own cage; the blank plate is the undeniable visual receipt. No teleporting props, no retroactive knowledge; even the shredded map’s salt/tear residue is pre-figured by the ink dampened with Elias’s truthful breath.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the iceberg’s shatter-release seeds the sky and re-tunes the world, cost paid in the vanishing object and the bluff’s held breath. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chime-strike deepens density until the pattern breaks in the crystalline scatter. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causal breaks. A hairline slip: the “next sculpture” coda slightly dilutes the final image’s sting, keeping it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—“static→box→match→ash→bloom.” The decisive change lands when Elias steps outside; the dome’s reset and his plating scoured by wind make the cost undeniable. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: locket hum → mailbox clang → letter → shared listening ritual, each beat narrowing communal options. The 1989-disappearance backstory is anchored to present stimuli within 120 words and repaid when Mrs. Delgado’s hands tremble, so orientation waiver applies. Closure is a Charged Poise: the courtyard’s new compact to keep writing letters crystallizes options with felt social cost—Elena stays absent yet present.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: time “accumulates” like silt, the dice-clatter pattern teaches the trigger rule, and closure lands in Charged Poise—LIBERATE pulse with ocean rushing in. Orientation is anchored by submerged glass, green glow, and journal fragments before 120 words. The final image (Lira surfacing, salt dissolving secrets) reweights the premise: drowning = creation. Cost is legible: the lab forfeits its memory, Lira forfeits translation, keeps only pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lit wick, coffee spiral, and petal curl adds density until the gravity pocket tears the wife’s name into a ripple. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the gravity… always hungry” reconfigures the night’s stakes without tidying grief. Cost is legible in the final image—lanterns burning on while something stirs below. One hairline slip: “the whale’s bones would be gone by morning” is forecast, not dramatized, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the origami wing drifts back “quieter,” re-weighting the prophecy from scream to sigh with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—the hush she maps literally lessens the prophecy’s mass. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“summoner knelt by the brook”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (folding light, water-stillness) pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias assumes the tutor role, the loop sealed by the identical sugar-knock image, undeniable conceptual cost that “some agreements are tombs.” Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each meteor-lesson adds density until the pattern crystallizes in the hand-off. Orientation anchors (third-floor, rooftop, Tuesday stairs) are taught early and payoff at the end, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of seeding memories into garden lattice tightens stakes by intensifying sensory density (“petals blackened…silvered”). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the garden keeps singing, patrol hesitates—cost is legible in the dragged-away body while the lattice never stops. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no ambiguity. One transition (night→dawn) taught by star-fading refrain. Persistent constraint: lattice hum becomes irreversible public memory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore chain anchored to the thorn-ink device. Orientation is secured by line 4 (marble sanctuary, aurora overhead). The climax—the thorn pressed to ledger spine dissolving decrees—delivers a decisive change with undeniable cost (names rise like mist, Emperor weeps). One minor elasticity: the guard's boot scuff is a pure tension beat that never materializes, but it does not break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: shell clue → descent → recognition that echoes are answers → song snaps threads → Kaelis humanized → shell discarded. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3 and never drifts. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the nexus’s hum quiets, Kaelis’s eyes empty, Veyra forfeits future answers. Lens holds causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Lena lighting a candle beside the glacier’s “sigh” reweights salvaging—grief is not fixed but endlessly mined. Accumulative lens holds throughout: each object (globe, locket, altar ice) accrues spectral residue until the widow’s departure lets silence accumulate as earned stasis. Orientation is taught by line 4 (glacier shrine, post-wreck timeline). Causal micro-beats (widow touches globe → sees child) tighten once, then widen to Lena’s self-exposure; cost is felt when she admits she “kept the parts worth saving” while pressing rust to glass.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure lands as Charged Poise: the nets “breathing” reweights every prior image with felt cost—Liora will now see unseen labor in each rise-fall. Causality is intact: whisk → whistle → fish → apprenticeship; no teleport, no soft reset. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; moon-path mechanics stay consistent. The final sentence “the cycle began again” crystallizes options without tidy resolution, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard transmuted from conspiracy site into living cure, refracting Voss into multiplied futures. Causal lens holds throughout—each image (letters, pit, diamond) tightens the because/therefore chain toward the valve revelation. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“wasteland orchard”) and the 120-word window clears with spatial clarity (“six feet wide, lined with lead sheets”). Cost is unmistakable: his body vanishes, the radio voice confirms the price is transmission itself.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: every transmission tightens the vice (“You are the hinge…”) therefore Elias reinforces the portico therefore the reflection steps through. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the receiver swallowed, silence purchased, city rising—so the before/after is legible. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“observatory,” “mountain,” “storm”). No causal breaks; even the portico-as-door rule is seeded early and paid off when the glass drinks the receiver.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each jarred sound and the groaning box thicken the texture until the single wobbly note reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias winds the box and reaches for the next jar—cost felt in the fragility of the note and the irrevocable release of hoarded past. Orientation anchored by line 4; transition from loft to balcony is one clean shard break. No causal break; ellipsis between girl’s exit and final paragraph is motivated and paid off in the lighter air.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lighthouse beam becomes a hymn, her body rewired, artifact stable—cost unmistakable. Causal chain holds: thinning ice → key turn → vibrational match → beam, all on-page. No orientation debt; lens stays Accumulative/Textural to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds throughout: moon-tracking data → anticipatory stillness → viaduct surrender. Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: “He walked forward… toward the patient, wild unknown” reconfigures revolution from noise to horizon-reveal, cost paid in exile and years of solitude. One micro-turn (ice groans, bridge lifts) is sufficient at this length; escalation is quiet but causally linked. Orientation is secure at word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: lantern find → symbol read → wall breach → archive dash, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the broken-glass constellation image reweights every prior shaft of light, and the decision to climb carries an undeniable future cost (drowning or exposure). One transition (ladder ascent) is cleanly anchored. Minor waiver: orientation is complete by word 70, well inside the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the music box’s unbroken hymn and the sealed letter reweight every prior silence; the cost is the storm-soaked walk and the irrevocable sending. Causal lens holds: because Harkin built the heart, therefore Elias must build his own absolution; each gear-turn tightens the option space. No prophecy or coincidence resolves the stakes; the final beat simply forecloses waiting. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 10 and never wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the melted arrow fused to her chestplate reweights the premise—she’s no longer falling but *conducting*. Causal lens holds: every test flight snaps chains and forecloses safe perch. Acid sea and collapsing workshop are persistent constraints that shape the final launch. Cost is legible in the fused metal and the lost sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Lena rewrites the archive’s rule-set by flooding it with the very memories it was built to erase, accepting deletion as cost. Causal chain holds: because she cracks the numeric cipher she locates the hidden server, because she uploads the crystal the system flags her for termination, therefore she chooses deletion. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no debt. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final line: “the archive was silent”—a heartbeat stilled, price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias steps forward, mirrors shatter, reconfiguring the night from solitary to shared risk; cost is the foreclosed safety of observer status. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—visions and fragment density build to the final crystallising image; linkage holds. Orientation is clean by word 60. No meaningful escalation beat after the mirror-adjustment; tension mainly thickens atmosphere rather than narrowing tactical options, capping score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: parasol tip tucked like a live wire, fjord wind salt-repricing every prior thought of endings. Causal chain is tight—false-name enlistment → ice-cross → dog-bond → initials revelation—each beat narrowing her death-slot until she abandons it. Drive lens is Accumulative: cadence of thaw, village murmur, lace silver re-weight meaning without external antagonist. Cost is unmistakable in final image: “space between one breath and the next” is the forfeited certainty of scheduled death.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens dominates: letter discovery → memory excavation → parallel drawing → charcoal sketch → acceptance; each beat is linked by "because/therefore" logic. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the folded letter in his pocket crystallizes options—stay, with loneliness now chosen, not imposed—at visible cost of future solitude. No orientation debt; who/where/when clear by line 3. Minor time-stamp fuzziness ("an hour ago" vs "five years") does not break continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Lysan refuses to let the clearing collapse, pays with ongoing exposure to the prophet’s echoes, and the final image—“the desert would remember”—makes the cost conceptual but undeniable. Causality is lyric/accumulative: each sensory beat thickens the texture of silence until the parapet’s song re-stitches the fraying border. The lens holds without ambiguity; the only minor drag is a slightly late geographic anchor for the pavilion’s interior, but the disorientation is taught early and waived at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the click re-weights generations of grief into “arcs of light,” a felt cost paid by the archivist’s own lingering ache and the town’s unspoken relief. Causal linkage is lyric but traceable—each photograph thread tightens until the butterfly/fence image crystallizes meaning. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught by the repeating “arcs” and lavender cues, held cleanly to the last line. No orientation or telegraphing issues; space/time anchors are vivid by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s pulse reframes silence as “a breath held.” Causal chain holds—crystal test → pattern heard → alliance formed—each step narrowing options. Cost is felt: Elias forsakes archival safety for unknown field work. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the tape silenced, arrows snapped, fog reclaims garden—cost is the forfeiture of prophet tools. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of chalk→driftwood→tape accretes until the cadence break of letting go. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. Causality is interior but legible: because he cannot bear the loop, therefore he relinquishes the markers.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s decision to let the observatory “sing” rather than fix it reweights the premise—constancy is motion, not stasis. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fracture/synchrony/leaf images builds to cadence shift. Cost is legible in the final image—“the shutter open wide” in his mind—concrete, felt. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are set by line 3. Causality holds: each camera activation is triggered by his pulse-match beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena releases the vinyl shard—an Earned Stasis that forecloses her private grief ritual and accepts perpetual serial goodbyes. The causal spine runs: shard-as-talisman → refusal to cure → hymning to reunify → release; each step cleanly narrows her options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“radiant haven above the clouds”): no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each key insertion tightens the stakes, moving from discovery → activation → irreversible trespass. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; the “Spooning” is abstract but its effect (noon shadows vanish) grounds the anomaly early. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the library door slams, “You’re late” re-prices her quest as already failed/synchronous, and the hunger she now shares is an undeniable conceptual cost. One minor loop—the phrase “learn to open them” echoes the title beat-for-beat—dulls the final cadence by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s sigh, the dissolving tooth, and the brother’s smooth palms reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—because Liora offers the tooth, the garden listens; because the garden listens, the map of constellations appears; because she names the bargain, the brother returns unmarked. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (hedge gap, golden light), well within the 120-word waiver. No lens ambiguity; the story’s logic is “causal-fantastic” and holds to the final image. Persistent constraint: the needle’s faint hum in her pocket keeps the price tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sea-glass changes keepers, reweighting the entire ethic from private practice to living lineage. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each lyrical return to mist, glass, and pulse thickens the stakes until the transfer reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: Liora’s empty palm and the girl’s white knuckles. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“grotto’s mouth”), well under the 120-word window; no causal or spatial breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the cathedral-of-moss setting accretes meaning until the final pendant transfer reweights the premise. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no drift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber’s loss and moss’s gain reprice “wound” as soil. Cost is legible—“I’ve got the moss” concedes lifelong vulnerability in exchange for shared growth.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the manuscript’s new title and the vanished body reweight the premise—story is current, not carved. The accumulative lens (pattern of cameos → absorption → rewrite) holds from first beat to last; the mist-parting image crystallizes options with undeniable cost. Causality is internal but coherent: “listening” triggers the text to re-author itself. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens: each sung phrase tightens the arbor’s response, narrowing failure risk until the living arch forms. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—burnt throat, heavier gourd, communal duty accepted. The hummingbird automaton’s return re-prices her old craft under the new covenant. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the map pulses with “a second heartbeat,” reweighting every prior discard into new constellations; cost is the literal blood and the years of failed attempts compressed into that glow. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each layer (paper, seeds, words) is a because/therefore of patience, not event, and the lens holds. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“subarctic crater”) and never drifts; the single transition (dawn snowfall) is legible. No plot amnesia or retro-patching; the apple-shell repository is set up and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the wife’s lullaby re-enters reality, making the before/after of “accessible wonder” legible, and the cost is the wounded season’s end—echoes will melt soon. The Accumulative lens is taught early and held: pattern of light-angle study → gear sketches → audible echo builds density rather than causal chain, and the final image crystallizes meaning under that lens. Orientation is anchored within first 80 words. One soft spot: cost is mainly existential, not visible on-page beyond a trembling breath; still, the closing tick charges the image sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the grotto’s hush layers like sediment, each calcified burden adding density until the final flame dissolve reweights the whole. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words and never drifts. Closure is a Charged Poise: the grotto exhales, Elira’s shadow walks beside her—cost is felt, no path is restored. One minor causality tremor: the grotto’s sudden “give-back” is not pre-seeded in rules, but the lyric pattern absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the uncarved blank remains upstairs, the completed lion stays on the sill, and the widow sits with cooled water—three silent objects that reconfigure her life-path with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; each carving session layers density until the final refusal to sell breaks the pattern. Causality is internal but legible: because each sale funded survival, refusing the next cup of coins forecloses future comfort. The last paragraph’s image of “steam curling into the shape of things she would never name” makes the conceptual price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—images accrue like film frames—and closure lands via Charged Poise: the blank frame + weightless jump reweight all prior fragments with undeniable cost. Causality is interior but legible: fragment-hoarding → ghost confrontation → renunciation. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) surface by line 4 and payoff at jump.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal is not restored but re-purposed, water re-routed, bridge sketched—cost is the irreversible admission that “the town won’t get its spaceport back.” Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—blueprints buried → she digs; sextant hum → she traces dead travelers’ arrows; water flows → doors open; bridge sketched → horizon replaces stars. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line three. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: belief is redirected, not returned. Persistent constraint—the corroded, structurally-unsound shell—shapes every tactic and the final Charged Poise image of the weather-vane pointing horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the asymmetrical, ticking orrery and the cracked forecourt reconfigure meaning—time is no longer measured but allowed to measure him. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush, echo, fracture pattern builds until the cadence shift (“the sanctuary itself seemed to exhale”) reweights stakes with felt cost. Orientation anchored in first paragraph (who, where, when) and pattern of crystal whispers is taught early; disorientation is functional, paid off when same whispers turn into his own unlived ticks. Persistent constraint—elders’ heresy charge—shapes every tactical hesitation; it lingers as the price he will pay after the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory repetitions (water, light, reflection) tighten toward the ledger-drop/sundial-keep binary that reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “a key that didn’t fit any lock” crystallizes options with felt opportunity-cost. Anchors clear by line 5; orientation test waived. One causal micro-turn—shadow pointing inward—escalates knowledge; luck used only as complication (radio crackle), never resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rope now sings, the bell buoy tolls in fog that shouldn’t exist, and the protagonist steps into white with no way back—the cost is the erasure of forward visibility. Causal linkage is tight: because Elias decodes knot → therefore he re-knots seed → thereby awakens the weavers’ archive. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The final image of “the knots, at last, began to sing” reweights every prior pattern under an Accumulative/Textural lens, undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the thread and locket crystallize into a compass for “cartographer of the spaces between departure and return.” Cost is felt—the prince stays absent, Elias accepts perpetual search—without sentimental payoff. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (thread, garden, tide) layers density until the final sentence reweights the absence as prayer, not loss. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no causal breaks, though the prince’s prior motives remain elliptical by design.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glass-winged creature refracts dying light into “almost holy,” reweighting the premise that rebirth must be pure. Causal chain intact: egg discovery → hypothesized revival → sacrificial piercing → flawed flight → redefined success. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“palace—anchored to the ceiling of the world”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern (densifying imagery of rust/salt/light) holds to final image. Cost legible in “rust and salt and the bitter aftertaste of hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because her father burned, therefore she stitches cooling coin to coat; because the boy bleeds, therefore the thread reprises. One continuous scene anchored by word ~60; orientation never wavers. Closure is Earned Stasis—she refuses to let ashes define her, foreclosing the village’s script at the cost of perpetual suspicion; the coin’s darkened thread is the visible price. Micro-turn inside the scene (wound-binding) tightens stakes without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the box hums → she follows breadcrumbs → she breaches the brass door → she rips the memory-threads → fountains weep light. Orientation is anchored by line 4; mosaic pattern of breadcrumbs is taught early and paid off at the door. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s new luminescence and her walking away reweight the premise with undeniable social/existential cost. Persistent constraint—the box now dark—signals the price she keeps.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s rule-set is rewritten when Veyra pays a memory to open a non-thermal transit. Causality holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens—each sonar ping adds density until the path materializes. Orientation is complete by line 5; no anchors drift. The only causal fuzz is how the gear “demands” memory—no prior rule teaches this, so the price feels author-inserted rather than world-inevitable, but the final image reweights the premise cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone becomes vessel, butterfly becomes gift, poem becomes inheritance—each a charged re-pricing of grief. Causality is accumulative/textural: butterfly migration, ribbon roll, and cracked granite pattern toward the final crystallized stance. One shard (greenhouse) + one transition (walk to house) keeps within two-shard allowance; orientation anchored by word 60. Cost is felt in the cracked granite and the daughter’s tremor, though spectral rule-set is told more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each carved name adds density until the pendulum’s lag re-weights communal time. The tower, tide, and rake form a closed causal system—no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“clock tower’s gearwork”) and held. Closure image—Elias carving his own name—pays off the pattern with conceptual cost: he becomes the final counterweight. Minor 0.1 debit: the council’s prior ban is told, not dramatized, a distal causality ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    A tight causal chain: widow’s gift → lantern scrutiny → knot-by-knot visions → silo-voice warning → knowledge of river murder → chessboard reset. Each knot supplies a because/therefore turn that narrows Elias’s moral options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chess pieces realigned under cobalt stars crystallize his new, irreversible role as secret-keeper. Orientation anchor (gardener, silo edge, midnight) is locked by line 3; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spire’s song lifts the ink, reconfiguring the future from dictation to invitation—an undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of listening → dot → bloom → flock of starlings; density and cadence reweight the stake, no causal chain required. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (obsidian spire, frozen lake, dawn). One persistent constraint—the ink that reacts to truth—shapes every stroke and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the phrase blanketing the city in ash re-weights the premise—stories now move without authors. Causal chain holds: pirate broadcast → girl arrival → ghost phrase propagation; each “because” tightens options. Cost is legible in the empty alcove and dry inkwell. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece teaches its pattern of repeated dissolution early (“ashes swirled…each fleck settling”) and deepens through density shifts until the final powder lift/resettle reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last image of Liora walking away while the mirage “holds for now” crystallizes options—she chooses endless unraveling over possession. The cost is legible in the mask’s cutting edges and the foreclosed option of ever finishing a portrait. One minor drag: the “vanishing point gallery” orientation is atmospheric but could anchor spatially 30 words sooner; waived because the withheld depth serves the closure illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lattice holds: cog find → secret vault → archival threat → last-stand blockage → drowning witness. Each ‘because’ tightens options until the final image of the still-reaching hand. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cog ticks in the silt, reweighting history itself while Elias’s extinction becomes the evidence he sought. Cost is undeniable—his life and the obliteration of his counter-archive—rendered in the mirrored brass gleam before dark.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final shimmer of “what they were learning to hold” reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—silence itself becomes the new music. Causality is interior but legible: because the rosette remembers, Elias subtracts noise instead of adding notes, therefore the choir reconstitutes as a listening body. Cost is palpable—twenty voices shrunk to four, the hollow rosette as persistent constraint. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“The velvet library exhaled…”), well within the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard (taste-memories, seed, broth) layers density until the final cadence reweights “chef” to “gardener.” Orientation anchored by line 7; no ambiguity. Closure is a Charged Poise: “quiet / sweet” rebellion crystallizes future risk (next seed saved) with felt social cost already paid (critics/elders enraged). Causality intact: because he tastes, he plants; because fruit ripens, he feeds; because he feeds, identity transmutes. Persistent constraint—alignment timing—shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the blackout silence intensifies sensory density and reweights the dominant stake (routine vs wonder) until the seed-image crystallises a new cadence. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—“the air tasted of rain and possibility”—with felt conceptual cost (tolls will return, engineers will disbelieve). Orientation is anchored by word 60; only one soft causal leap—storm → instantaneous beehive failure is accepted because the text later assigns agency to the seed act. No cap triggered; lite causal hiccup doesn’t touch the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “displaced things” builds density until the spiral placement catalyzes Charged Poise reconfiguration—houses’ silence reweighted from puzzle to partner. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no debt applied. Closure cost is legible in the final breath-image: “the air tasted different,” a sensory forfeiture that forecloses collector-identity. No causal break; ellipsis between voice-hearing and key-pressing is motivated by Liora’s practiced non-reaction to the uncanny.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “gods are just stories we drown in” reweights every prior certainty and the ampoule itself becomes pigment, not poison—undeniable social cost of renouncing mission and surface world. Causal lattice holds: because Liora unravels each scholarly lie, therefore the intruder threads the seam, therefore the dome splits and child-song rises. Orientation is taught late but pays off—initial disorientation (silt, hollow eyes) resolves into literal birth-threshold, so Orientation Test waived. One hairline slip: ampoule slip feels micro-coincidental, but telepathic nudge justifies it inside causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the staircase’s pattern accretes meaning until the chipped die’s recursive bounce ruptures it. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Lena’s sideways leap reweights the entire climb as chosen loop rather than prison, with the smooth die abandoned as visible cost. Causality is internal yet legible: because she treats texture as truth, therefore she can refuse escape.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf vanishes, the brush tip wears, the moon clarifies—three concrete signs that the kindness experiment has re-priced the city’s air. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of nightly inscription→absorption→renewal tightens into the final charged poise without needing causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words and never drift. The only soft spot is the off-stage removal of the leaf; because the poet can’t witness the transfer, the “cost” is felt more than dramatized, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered emerald shards pulsing in the case reweight the rules—art survives only by re-incorporation into living hands, not by preservation behind glass. Causal chain holds: lens reveals loss → bread re-taught → lens destroyed → recipes reclaimed, each step tightening options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the irreversible destruction of the city’s single “archive” and in Liora’s sliced palms carving dough.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world literally loses Elias and clocks reverse, a cost visible in the mainland’s backward tick. Causal chain holds—yoyo wound → gears turn → path opens → Elias steps → tide erases—each beat tightening options under the Causal lens. Orientation is immediate: lighthouse, low tide, night, within fifty words. No lens ambiguity; the final “negative space between ticks” reconfirms the clockmaker’s domain.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the raven-clasp snaps shut on the last ember, reweighting the rule-set—photos will still smear, but now on his terms. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: mirror-oil, burnt-sugar air, filmstrip ignition tighten the cadence toward the final image. Orientation is taught early (ticket-booth shards, mirror-lung) and pays off inside the spiral. Cost is unmistakable: “his reflection… winked” signals ownership of the curse.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sea’s hum becomes chord, obstacle becomes instrument, and Leeward’s laugh crystallizes the new rule-set with undeniable cost (restlessness flips to thrill). Causal lens holds: because he strikes, therefore sky and sea rewrite themselves. Anchors (who, where, when) land by line 4. No teleporting props; mallet, orchard, tide remain state-tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gate screams open, Elyas crosses, turtles stir—cost is felt in the city’s tremor and the whistle’s dust. Causal lattice holds: each beat (crack → harmonic reply → watchers advance → gate answers) is a because/therefore chain. Accumulation of shell-maps and pattern languages pays off in the final sequence; no off-stage cheats. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“city of Vahroon… gate rusted shut”).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias exchanges the inkwell for the Keeper’s ledger, accepting perpetual custodianship; cost is legible in the smile that follows the loss. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each submerged artifact and answered note deepens the pattern until the final trade crystallizes it. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure. One shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the blackout erases surface noise, therefore Elias can hear the stamp’s whisper; because he tests the hidden-archive hypothesis, therefore he locates the sealed chamber; because he meets his pre-written fate, therefore he chooses reclaimed stillness as charged poise. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (glass dome, water at knees), well inside the 120-word window. Closure lands on-page: the act of resealing the chamber and pocketing the stamp in the blank ledger is a decisive change that reweights stillness from absence to active choice, cost felt in the ocean’s hum that now includes his complicity. Persistent constraint: the existing record will continue to script him—tactics already shaped when he “turned the page.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: basilica’s paradoxical descent/ascent is driven by the gem insertion, tightening until the cranes lift the isle into the dream-realm; closure reconfigures gravity itself with the mother’s dissolution as visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (geode warm → thread bright → finger hovers) is a because/therefore chain that collapses options. Closure is Charged Poise: observatory dark, geode cold again, storm still raging—felt cost is the irreversibility of mere memory. No orientation debt; dome groan and console cue anchor space/time by line 4. The final image reweights the premise: she pays with eternal incompleteness for a single instant of pre-choice sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chip-slot marriage projects a new constellation, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights “missing pieces” from personal lack to shared map. Causal chain holds: dusk angle → star trails → chip → slot → sky-pattern, each step tightening options. Orientation is anchored by sentence three; no debt. Cost is felt: Lena’s anonymity lost, pilgrim’s custody forfeited, both now linked under an impossible sky.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the folded tomorrow-date note crystallizes options with undeniable cost under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sifted object reweights the lie-heavier past. Causality is tight: because Elias keeps the watch hand, therefore the sea returns the paper, narrowing future to one dawn appointment. No prop teleport; watch hand is seeded, lost, replaced by paper in a causal loop. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) reached by word 78; waiver met.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—drawer-pull offered → nephew freed → war limps on. The final image of swallowed footprints is a Charged Poise that reweights neutrality as a persistent, costly stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. Cost is legible in the boy’s torn skin and the general’s surrendered cache intel.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure = Earned Stasis: he renounces departure, walks inland, felt cost = the hollow compass weight vs. older letters. Causal chain intact: daughter’s words → compass humiliation → pole-counting ritual → post-office steps → bar admission “Just late.” Orientation taught inside 120 wds (saltwind, dock, leaning pole) and serves final image (golden poles). Lens = Causal: every beat narrows option from sea to letters. One micro-turn at “Instead, he turned inland” cleanly forecloses escape.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the path across the lake and the chess invitation re-configure options with felt social cost. Causal lattice holds—newspaper cue → lake test → ballthrow → dry path—each “because” tightens agency; no prop teleports. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 80; transitions are clean in this two-shard design. Persistent constraint: the neural scrub cannot be undone, so every new choice is freighted with irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: spice imagery thickens, each scent-beat adds density until the final Charged Poise reweights her vocation. Closure—“she was the bridge”—lands with conceptual cost: she forfeits pure humanity. Cause-effect is present but subordinate to textural intensification; fortune-crumble and ash serve as tangible price tags. Orientation is clean by line 4; no caps triggered.

    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias stays “for now,” rewrapping the tin while the library’s fragile resistance endures—a crystallized moment where stakes (survival through beauty) and options (flee or fortify) are legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. The moon’s arc and dawn’s approach provide temporal scaffolding; anchors (who: Elias/Maren; where: prison library; when: post-riot night) are clear by line 3. Cost is visible in the dead’s memorized names and the guards’ looming return. The false-bottom tin’s reuse and violet addition deepen meaning without causal slippage.

    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena’s ritualistic endurance culminates in a decisive act (projecting the spliced reel) that reconfigures possibility. The arbor’s groan, the clock’s sudden warmth, and the compasses locking toward the screen form a causal chain under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory intensification tightens pressure until the path materializes. Cost is legible in the projector’s death (“burning brightest just before it died”) and the unspoken years of solitude. Every object introduced pays off without retroactive magic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ridge isn’t a vessel but memory itself, reweighting all prior assumptions with undeniable cost (Liora’s lost identity). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory fragments until the monsoon’s “exhale” crystallizes meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; the single scene tightens pressure through dream distortions escalating to Manik’s amnesia. Final image (“eyes reflecting a light that wasn’t the sun’s”) makes cost legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first image (“damp sighs”) to the cerulean leaves at dawn, with pressure escalating via sensory density and patterned recurrence (lace, knots, tides). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the horizon shifts from “wound” to “place where sky remembers water,” reconfiguring remembrance as integration, not drowning. Cost is legible in the bonsai’s color shift and Elias’s lighter heart—earned through the compass’s ritual, not coincidence. Orientation anchors instantly: who (Elias), where (islet), when (after rain, after severance).
