  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through dust applications, pattern recognition, and the shift from "making things matter" to "watching things fall apart," culminating in Earned Stasis where Elias accepts decay with visible cost (abandoning career trajectory). The closure lands with "The Theory of Kindled Humility" as both conceptual repricing and character transformation, though the email exchange feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (frost/glass/pauses) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora releases the ledger and steps into "the quiet kind" of light. Cost is visible in letting the ledger fall—abandoning concrete evidence of her brother. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (canyon location abstract initially) and some philosophical abstraction in final beats diluting the physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Liora stepping into the storm to "raise" the Capriccio through song, proving silence and music "had been the same thing all along." The heat-map cipher drives causality from emotion to frequency to breakthrough. Cost is legible in bleeding fingers and the choice to return to danger. Slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of the central revelation lacking one more concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dead's acknowledgment transforms rest from absence to presence ("you are here"), with clear cost in Elias's acceptance of his role. The accumulative structure coheres through water imagery, building from the drowned city to the lighthouse climb to the final "sediment" settling, though the lens's sudden appearance could use stronger grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the community's collective refusal to be erased, crystallized in the image of children handing out bread to soldiers. The accumulative structure coheres as small acts build to collective resistance, with the burned arbor as visible cost and the roses/bell as charged renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost—Elias transforms from seeker to keeper, understanding that "unused love" stays and waits. The accumulative structure coheres as each image (viaduct, jade, floating embers) builds toward the final revelation, with clear before/after in his role.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered time-loops, photograph dissolution, and geometric warping, culminating in Liora's conceptual repricing that shifts from solving to designing edges. The halo fragment's destruction releases trapped moments with clear cost ("collapsed...hands shaking"). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with Liora in the living bridge garden.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lena transforms from imprisoned to liberator, with visible cost in her "six years in the cell" and the ongoing work ahead. The causal chain from wall's fall to seed planting is tight, and the final image of armed soil reweights the opening's "jagged scar." Slight deduction for mild orientation delay regarding the exact nature of the wall's political context.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-teaching of absence-as-material and synesthetic perception. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias stops naming/controlling and allows immersion, with clear cost in the greenhouse's drowning and his acceptance of erosion over breaking. The forge's transformation from cold to lit to extinguished traces a complete arc with each state carrying meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Liora "becomes" the moment itself, but the cost remains abstract—"She didn't rise. But the light—Oh, the light remained" gestures at transcendence without concrete loss. The accumulative texture builds effectively through moonbeams, portraits, and temporal imagery, though the final transformation's mechanics feel underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's shift from attempting to encapsulate/preserve to accepting fragility as strength. The cost appears in "she wouldn't need" her tools and the abandoned bookmark "an invitation, or a warning." However, the transition between control room and observatory could be cleaner, and some causal linkages feel slightly loose under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure: Lena transforms from erased victim to agent of her own proof through the ledger discovery. The shell's whispers → cast message → ledger location creates a because/therefore chain. Cost is visible in the blood price and the acceptance of fear ("fear wasn't the enemy. It was the current you learned to ride"). Slight deduction for the child's unexplained knowledge weakening mid-story causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered silences until Eldrin's dissolution creates Resonant Reconfiguration—he becomes what he sought to map. Cost is unmistakable: "no longer a man but another layer of quiet." Opening anchors who/where/when efficiently, and the pattern of collected silences builds coherently to the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught looped timelines paying off in the dissolution/reformation sequence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as X-7 recovers its pre-directive identity with clear cost ("the quiet despair of forgetting"). The violin's transformation from frozen object to singing instrument charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lena's transformation from cryptic to clear communication, with visible cost in her years of mistrust now released. The accumulative lens holds consistently through image layering (rain/crystals/light/tickets). Orientation anchors arrive promptly though the "forecourt's acoustics" claim strains physics slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the elders shift from ledgers to learning "the names of the vines," with visible cost in their "fuller hearts" and the vine dresser's years of isolation. The accumulative lens holds as metaphors of cracks/mending build toward the garden's choice to heal the marbles, reweighting the central question of measurable versus immeasurable value.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where K-11's escape to "elsewhen" validates Elias's theory with clear cost (protocol violations, specimen loss). The accumulative structure coheres well through scientific observations building to proof. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Cost is visible but could be more viscerally felt at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where silence becomes duet, with felt cost in "played until the lanterns burned out." The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern-building (water damage revealing messages, in-between spaces as vessels). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The transformation from tomb to duet lands with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise as Liora steps into the storm, crystallizing her choice between warning others and accepting dissolution. The cost is legible in "The wind carried her name away before she could hear it." However, the middle section meanders through reflection without sufficient present-frame anchoring, and the actual storm's arrival feels somewhat abrupt despite the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail and recurring motifs (weight, thread, ghost shift) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts burden rather than proof. The valve wheel's transformation from "too heavy for its size" to "lighter now, as if it had exhaled its secret" marks decisive change with clear cost—Elias inherits the factory's haunted legacy. Orientation anchors (tunnel, Elias, abandoned factory context) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the keeper's transformation from person to "witness, fold, breath." The cost is legible in their lost name, forgotten expressions, and absorption into the library's silence. However, the conceptual weight of "regenerative silence" remains somewhat abstract, preventing full cost clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully - Mira's recovered hum creates a before/after with visible emotional cost ("tears of someone who'd just remembered how to wonder"). The accumulative structure coheres through musical motifs building to the eclipse moment. Slight dock for the epilogue feeling rushed after the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-building through recurring images (dragons, fire, displacement). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias leaves the silo with the tapestry "warm as a living thing," the world beginning to "remember how to turn." The cost is legible in his acceptance of displacement and abandonment of the silo's safety. Orientation anchors effectively by line 3 (Elias, silo library, post-apocalyptic setting).

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Chen's departure - the lighthouse going dark for the first time in twenty years marks decisive change with clear cost. The accumulative lens holds as fortunes and secrets layer toward the final reweighting. Minor orientation wobble with "the island" introduced before establishing Chen's location weakens early grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the priest's transformation reweights the anchor from prison to question, with visible cost (his dissolution). The cyclical structure with the novice works well. Deduction for orientation delay - we don't understand the dimensional anchor's function until late, creating unnecessary opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Li Wei's shift from passive fortune-writer to active conductor, with visible emotional cost tied to his displacement and family losses. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories build toward the final crystallized moment, though the conducting metaphor's exact mechanics remain slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias achieves integration by merging with his fractured self, with visible cost (tablet crumbles, runes burn into skin). The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery ("fractured into jagged shards") builds toward causal resolution. The orientation anchors (viaduct, Elias, rain) establish by ~50 words. Cost is legible in "The tablet flared white-hot in his hand, the runes searing into his skin."

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory accretion toward Elias's Resonant Reconfiguration from isolation to connection. The closure lands with felt cost as he transforms from defeated teacher to one who will "teach them to feel the music, not hear it," with the numbness becoming "a door" rather than a wall. The backward songs concept effectively reweights his relationship to music and teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and atmospheric pressure build toward Charged Poise—Elias crystallizes his stance to "record the silence" knowing "it wouldn't stay silent for long." Cost is felt through his uncertainty about being found and the weight of solitary integrity. The quarantine zone's awakening ("It's breathing now") effectively reweights prior observations, though the cost could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's understanding reprices his entire relationship with grief and the flowers, leading to decisive action (destroying lanterns, selling vial, leaving). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build to the perfume's release triggering revelation. Cost is visible in abandoning his life's work and the Luminara dying without him. Slight deduction for the mechanically tidy resolution of selling the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure where the rope transforms into a ladder—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (burned hands, the weight of unanswerable questions). The energy beings' addition of luminous thread and the poet's final transformation of the rope create clear before/after with "the weight of a question he couldn't answer—only live."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Liora shifts from preserving the past alone to carrying music forward through teaching, with visible cost in abandoning her father's unfinished melody for something new. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, post-fire world, violinist) establish cleanly by ~100 words. Deduction for the slightly abstract framing of the dawn choice rather than more concrete immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through Liora's choice to fuse with the emotion rather than counterfeit it, forcing the chemist to confront his actual loss. The cost lands powerfully: he loses his comforting lie and gains painful self-knowledge. Who/where/when anchored early through "amber grotto," "dusk," and character roles.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through their partnership agreement, with visible cost implied in Elias's unbalanced ledger. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the locket coincidence strains credibility slightly. The closure successfully reweights prior gestures of anonymous kindness into a formalized alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the constellation of handprints transforming the arbor from individual creation to communal artifact. The cost is legible in Reed's acceptance that "some webs were meant to be woven slowly" - releasing control for collective belonging. The accumulative pattern holds consistently through tags, touches, and grafting imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the moths' return and the echoes beginning to speak, with the pendant burning cold as visible cost. The accumulative structure builds effectively through layered imagery. However, the causality between throwing the jar and pulling the thread remains opaque, and the exact nature of the transformation lacks clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "some equations weren't meant to balance" reweights the entire mathematical metaphor with clear emotional cost shown through the clouding of the clear eye. The accumulative structure coheres through water/sight/mathematics imagery building to this earned realization.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elias steps from shadows into connection, foreclosing his seventeen-year isolation with visible cost ("For the first time in seventeen years, Elias didn't retreat"). The ferromagnetic tape carrying the woman's childhood laugh creates a because/therefore chain that crystallizes in mutual recognition. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, Elias in crawl spaces) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Liora spreading her arms in the rain, unable to tell "where the storm ended and she began"—a crystallized transformation with visible cost (abandoning her father's orderly nursery). The accumulative structure coheres through escalating discoveries, though the midpoint revelation about "using" the storm arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient textural preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught crooked rain leading to revelation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's acceptance of his role as crack-follower, with visible cost in his years of sleeplessness now reframed as preparation. The brooch's return "warm as skin" and straightened rain create legitimate before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora's shift from seeking foresight to inhabiting presence, with cost visible in leaving the pearl behind and accepting she "didn't see it coming." The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through sensory layering (cave's song, pearl's colors, shadow folding) that builds to the conceptual repricing of magic itself.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "Today, the absence was enough" crystallizes the entire accumulative arc with felt cost. The piece teaches its pattern of fragments early and pays it off through the valve's journey from buried relic to child's potential. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through cracks, mist, and mapping imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts mystery over certainty, with visible cost in releasing his sister. The phantom punch's transformation from tool to threshold and the vault's revelation as "moment not place" create earned causality. The closure's shift from solving to "carrying with trembling certainty" reweights the entire premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens drives the piece through density increase and pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora transforms from skeptic to "cartographer of echoes." Cost is legible in her acceptance that "grief, like the sea, was never just one wave." The closure lands with felt emotional price, though the extended coda after "She closed her eyes and listened" dilutes impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: Lysander's release of the amulet fragment transforms the escondite from place to question, with clear cost in dissolving his known reality. The accumulative structure coheres as magnetic pulses, dimensional arguments, and spatial rebellion build toward the crystallizing moment where "Goodbye wasn't an ending. / It was the first honest thing he'd ever said." Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the ink dissolves rigid debt structures and Lira chooses collective math over individual accounting ("They added up to *them*"). The causal chain holds from ledger discovery through ink transformation to border crossing. Slight deduction for the magical realism element not being fully taught before its climactic use.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered historical fragments, but lacks a true closure with visible cost. The ending merely continues the pattern ("he had other histories to invent") without decisive change or reconfiguration. The stationer's discovery of Elara creates texture but no genuine transformation or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments layer into density, culminating in Daniel pressing his collected pieces into the labyrinth's heart—a Resonant Reconfiguration where erasure becomes absorption. Cost is unmistakable: "the water closed behind him without a ripple" signals complete dissolution, while "Some poisons were meant to be absorbed" reprices his collecting as intentional self-poisoning.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias becoming myth keeper rather than buster, with visible cost in the dissolving journal and blank shell. The accumulative structure coheres through musical/auditory motifs building to "The riddle answers back." However, the conceptual leap to "harmonize with it" feels slightly rushed, and the skin-writing gesture strains credibility at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as graffiti messages accumulate pressure toward Elira's crystallized stance of "building a third" world. Closure lands through Charged Poise—the embedded chip in wet paint reconfigures her position with felt cost ("finally where she belonged—caught between two worlds"). The "still time" ending acknowledges urgency while affirming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the three-pulse canister creating temporal markers against the mining countdown. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's departure carrying his private archive while the crater awaits destruction—cost is palpable in "what it had lost." The sand grain's transformation from timekeeper to witness deepens the stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward Elias's intervention, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mist parts to reveal the golden corridor—a physical manifestation of corrected perception. Cost is visible in his anonymous departure and return to "a dozen other broken things." Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and the convenience of immediate array correction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition builds through condensation, phrasebook fragments, and Kael's notes until Lena's palm on ice triggers the Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes what she sought to map. Cost is legible: her human form dissolves into the lake's primordial memory, the outpost groans "in relief" at witnessing completion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the tuner's rhythmic persistence transforms the dead town into something alive, with clear cost in his physical exhaustion ("walked until his legs ached"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through rhythmic layering and sensory density that builds to the child's laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the "gathered hush" achieving Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Liora accepts living with loss rather than erasing it. Cost is visible in "the weight of what she'd lost" and her permanent inland exile. The perfume's transformation from violet-scented to clear water marks decisive change with clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Decisive Change occurs when Elias retrieves his father's name and speaks truth for the first time, with the cost being perpetual disbelief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of imagery and pattern-breaking at closure. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for slightly abstract cost presentation—the price of disbelief could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Vesper's awakening and Liora's dissolution, with visible cost in her unraveling "thread by thread." The cyclical structure ("For now. The bead's resonance would return") reinforces the debt's eternal nature while the dawn imagery provides conceptual repricing of the endless night.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the labyrinth transforms from maze to loom to door, with visible cost in Elias's "bones aching with the weight of the path he'd walked." The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the sapling splits the sundial base, transforming the catacombs from tomb to seedbed with visible cost (the cracked stone). The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and pattern building. Slight dock for the predictable arc from returnee-to-renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lena's return to work after mailing Mizuho, with "That's where the meaning was" crystallizing her philosophy. The cost is subtly felt in "a secret kept" and her acceptance of living in margins, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the climactic broadcast. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias sacrifices himself to scatter truth across the city, with visible cost in "the observatory's dome shattered outward." The orientation is clear (observatory, Elias, autumn evening), and the "seeds scattered" image reweights the opening's isolation. Deduction for some causality softness around how exactly the telescope/flame mechanism works.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Liora moves deeper into the mangroves, building pressure through the spirits' recognition and her ritual with condensation, culminating in releasing the letter—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("a touch as light as forgiveness"). The "moment before deciding" frames the arc clearly, though the sister remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments build toward the coral transfer—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena's role shifts from translator to active grafter of meaning. Cost is visible in "ribs singing" and the weight of carrying others' grief. Opening orientation delayed but pays off thematically; the coral's journey from wreckage to gift reweights prior trauma imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the projected orchard transforms the ruined space, making past joy briefly tangible with clear cost (the ephemeral nature of the projection). The accumulative build through fresco discovery → film development → public display creates coherent pressure. Orientation anchors established early.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught recursion and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora accepts the infinite cycle. Cost is legible in her dissolution into the garden's eternal pattern. Minor orientation wobble in the rapid mural-world transitions slightly dulls mid-section clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (plant-based language system) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where gardens become rebellion. The closure—Elias standing guard over "the spark of a thought, wild and untamed"—lands with conceptual cost (risk of discovery). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words with greenhouse setting and Ministry context.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "The Alchemy of Staying" - the poet sealing herself in the cocoon with visible cost (forgetting to title, but the wind supplies it). The accumulative structure coheres through recurring transformation imagery. Orientation is deliberately mythic but "who" remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: repair attempt → awakening → threat → necessary destruction, culminating in Earned Stasis where Liora accepts living with echoes rather than preserving them. The closure lands with visible cost as she destroys the chime and sits among "wreckage," though the nature of what awakened could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the archive transforms from tomb to living chorus, with visible cost in Elara's decade of penance and the shattered inkwell. The restoration of the Chorus creates a decisive before/after shift. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some causal looseness around how singing "in harmonic gaps" mechanically works.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from artifact (chain) to letter to blueprint to confrontation, with each discovery reweighting Liora's understanding of her father's legacy and the flood system. The closure—Liora's choice to present the compassionate alternative—lands with clear cost: risking the elders' rejection and her reputation. The "bridge or shackle" image crystallizes the stakes perfectly. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the elder's nod.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from isolation through Luca's letter to the final humming that reconfigures Elias's relationship with music. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost—his voice is "rusty" and notes "wrong," but he accepts this diminished capacity. Some causality around the fire and Luca's survival remains underexplored, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently with density increase toward the sinkhole revelation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The logbook codes, corn husk boat, and firefly patterns accumulate to reweight the maze's meaning from confusion-engine to threshold-finder, with Elias's descent marking visible cost. Orientation anchored cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's solitary mapping transforms into shared understanding, with clear cost (separation, staying below while he surfaces). The accumulative structure coheres well through the luminous respite framework. Orientation anchors (underwater facility, Dr. Voss, decades submerged) land within first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist absorbs memories and transforms (glowing blood, seeds rooting through skin). Cost is visible through physical transformation and the "weight of a thousand half-remembered lives," though the precise mechanics of how she "transliterates emotions into colors" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Lior's final performance crystallizes his stance that he plays "for the crack in the bishop's crown" with the tide's turn marking reconfigured meaning. The chess bishop anchors the thematic transformation from randomness to hidden order, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the verse-writing ritual that transforms exile into "home." The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the cosmic verse moment. Cost is visible in blood-as-ink and skin transformation. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors come late) but serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as patterns of light and water ripples build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration about attention as meaning-making. The closure lands with emotional cost (daughter's absence, the harbor's forgetting) though the final "reaching for the next stone" suggests continuation rather than decisive change. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from holding pain to transforming it into art, with visible cost in leaving the treasured box behind. The accumulative structure builds through layered imagery (fire scars, moon, valleys) toward the final gesture. The orientation is clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abrupt transition from reflection to action in the drawing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora's acceptance of perpetual questioning over resolution ("The answer was in the watching"). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from grotto description through timeline exploration to the final transformation where the gauge measures "sideways." Cost is visible in the erasure of her work by tides and the grandfather's failed ascent, creating a generational weight.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the corridor transforms from whispering to singing, the sealed door becomes an open threshold. Cost is visible in Elias's choice to engage with painful family memory and the physical act of completing the mural through dawn. The pattern of echoes→faces→song creates meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Liora's cyclical return to her role despite knowing its cost creates Earned Stasis with visible price (the soldier's lost dream, the empty terrace vision). Causality holds as each element builds toward her acceptance of being "neither thief nor saint," though the cost could be more viscerally dramatized rather than described.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where signing becomes redemption's installment payment, with visible cost in Kael's unraveling voice and the "newest notch, where the wood was still soft." The accumulative structure coheres through the clipboard's history, the terrace's memory, and the ritual's repetition, all converging on the paradox that trying again despite inevitable failure IS the redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the salt flat imagery until the egg placement creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's first act without calculating cost. The closure lands with visible sacrifice (the egg) and conceptual cost (his legacy split between drought and confession), though the final third relies heavily on reflection that, while anchored in the present act, slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora transforms from vessel to liberator, with clear cost shown through absorbed echoes weighing her body. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and echoes build pressure toward the final transformation. The threads-as-lives mechanism creates clear causality, and the loosened knots for future defiers shows lasting change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through layered imagery (dome/echo, fire/shadow, puppet/string) toward Elias's decision to reveal the mechanics of manipulation—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost in vulnerability. The miner's confrontation catalyzes this shift from hidden to exposed storytelling. Slight opacity around the specific puppet show content that triggered the violence weakens causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Lior's continued building despite futility carries clear cost in the wing's dissolution and his solitary vigil. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from single wing to spiral structure to final dissolution. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (grotto's nature unclear initially) and the cost being more conceptual than visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where preservation transforms from static holding to dynamic transmission, with visible cost (years of regret, the dissolved card). However, the orientation remains somewhat abstract - we never learn specifics about Elira's world or the nature of "casters," creating comprehension friction.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring path/choice imagery that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lior accepts being chosen rather than choosing. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the bunker and the ash transformation of the wafer seal—tangible losses that enable the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Qishti's fundamental understanding shifts from measuring a mechanical universe to participating in dialogue, with visible cost in his transformed hands bearing the schematic's traces. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern discovery leading to conceptual repricing. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the "dialogue" revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the brothers walking out together with the music box abandoned represents earned transformation with clear cost (leaving behind the physical anchor of their conflict). The accumulative lens holds throughout, building pressure through layered imagery. Minor orientation wobble with the sanctuary's nature, but it serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the mirror maker stepping through sky-windows, paying the cost of physical dissolution. The accumulative pattern—breathing, melting frost, dissolving boundaries—builds coherently toward this crystallized moment where "grounding is just another kind of flight." Cost is unmistakable: he releases his material self to join his brother's realm.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered symbols (ribbon, seed, apple) that reweight at closure when the mender finally understands their daughter saw cracks they couldn't. The eating of the apple creates Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—accepting the daughter's wisdom over their own pride. Orientation anchors (cathedral orchard, three years since contract broke) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Veyra becomes part of the cycle she discovered, with the cameo returning to its starting state. The orchard-as-library revelation reweights all prior imagery, and her choice to continue rather than document or destroy shows clear cost. Orientation anchors establish quickly (museum, asteroid, Dr. Veyra).

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias "becomes a gap" after spending his life collecting them—the cost is unmistakable. The accumulative structure builds through absences (unwritten symbols, unbloomed flowers) to the final reversal. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the emerald swatch accumulating power through ink absorption to resurrect the sister, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora chooses to save all lost twins rather than just her own. Cost is visible in the ship's destruction and the weight of taking on endless rescue work. The orientation anchors (ship, fog, carnival) establish setting within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic objects build toward Elara's merger with the archive of absence. The closure lands with conceptual cost—becoming part of what can't be recorded—though the felt price of this transformation could be sharper. The rope's reconfiguration meaningfully constrains her path to the door.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the bloom of hush transforming from weapon to invitation to growing harmony—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost as the caves permanently change. The pattern of listening/reading/mapping holds throughout, and the final image of Eldrin resting while the storm becomes a lullaby crystallizes the reconfigured world. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than visceral in places.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance between the prism's fractures and personal loss, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the beacon's flare reweights all prior coincidences into meaningful design. The closure lands with felt cost: "She didn't know if anyone was left to see the beacon. But that wasn't the point." establishes the price of continuing despite isolation. The causal chain from touching prism → tracing star paths → beacon flare → rain's arrival creates coherent escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—Summer-Quill stops trying to shape identity, accepting flow over control. The cost appears in "The inkwell was full. The page was blank. And for the first time, that was enough." Accumulative lens holds, though middle sections briefly drift toward abstraction about collective memory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the blooming fortress walls, glowing petals, and final cascade of returning stars. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora's defiant fireworks restore the stars, with cost visible in "The world was heavier than it had been yesterday. But so was she." The mosaic's message "Defy the weight" anchors the thematic arc and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the chronicler's gift of the cicada and her understanding that "transitions were never truly over, only layered." The cost is visible in her relinquishing the grandmother's heirloom and the fisherman's future grief softening "like a stone worn by the tide." The accumulative lens holds throughout, though the temporal jump to "years later" slightly weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through silence flavors, gilded threads, and the trellis bloom culminating in a Decisive Change where the child abandons the bunker. Cost is visceral in the father's scream and bunker collapse. The "You were never the lock. You were the door" repricing lands with conceptual weight, though the father's "They're coming" introduces slight late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the passenger's transformation from "burdened" to having weight "recalibrated—not lighter, but better distributed" with visible cost in her "flinched" reaction to laughter. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through storm glass states, prism refractions, and silence manipulation. Deduction for slightly abstract stakes that could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Elsin's choice to unmake the throne, showing clear cost as she walks away from power and vanishes into myth. The causal chain from ruby flake discovery to throne dissolution is coherent. Deduction for the somewhat abstract "age of ascension/choosing" framing that weakens the visceral cost of her sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lior steps through the newly-appeared door, with visible cost in abandoning the sanctuary lineage. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and shadow encroachment build pressure toward the crystallized choice. Who/where/when anchored early ("ashen sanctuary," "Lior," inherited space).

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through mushroom brightening, message accumulation, and conceptual unthreading that leads to Resonant Reconfiguration—Lina walking into desert as "a door" with diamond as transformed pressure. Cost is legible in blood, abandoned farm, and foreclosed return. Orientation anchored early (farm, mushrooms, bolt).

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror discovery and standing wave tuning creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias shifts from dynasty-ender to bridge-crosser with visible cost (abandoning the search for traditional legacy). The progression from letters→crank handle→mirror→revelation builds causally. Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of the "bridge" and what crossing means prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the knight transforms from withdrawn observer to active participant. The closure lands with unmistakable cost—seven years of silence broken, the pain of smiling "like holy fire," and the transformation from chains to wings. The persistent constraint of silence shapes every tactic until the final "unsnap" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: density builds through file details, button discovery, research revelation, culminating in Elias's shift from passive archivist to active intervener. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he opens Maria's file "scanning for gaps," transforming his role with visible cost (abandoning detachment). The pattern of "small things...magnified in the retelling" pays off through his action.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lena's shift from solitary archivist to initiator of the Quiet Rebellion, with visible cost in her erasure from history ("her name just another whisper in the static"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build—the lagoon, phone booth appearances, stolen ledger—culminating in the pattern of "small, impossible acts." Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the saxophonist attempting to "hush" a prophecy through anti-music, discovering he authored it, and accepting his cyclical fate—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in his endless return. The pattern of silence/sound/prophecy accumulates pressure through density shifts and the revelation of the handwritten note. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the circular structure pays off when he returns to the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught transformation ("The transformed remember. You are the key's keeper now") building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes part tree, part human. The closure lands with visible cost—her physical transformation and the arbor's dissolution into saplings she must now tend. Minor orientation wobble with the floating arbor's spatial logic but recovers through consistent world-rules.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with pattern accumulation (broken things holding secrets) leading to Resonant Reconfiguration where the tinkerer befriends uncertainty's absence. The cost is visible in his releasing the gear and accepting the wild city's growth. Minor orientation wobble with the greenhouse transition but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Liora learns to "carry the weight" differently through transmutation of self. The coin-to-crucible-to-vial progression creates causal linkage, though the final workshop scene slightly dilutes focus. Cost is legible in accepting Veyra's path despite mortal risk ("reduce her to ash").

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the harp's transformed music—notes remain "distorted, but now they *harmonized*"—with visible cost in the soul's integration rather than release. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image of carried laughter. The orientation anchors (Liora, Echo Gorge, dawn) establish clearly within the first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where Liran accepts mercy as absence rather than formula. Cost is legible in the "ledger of absences" and physical transformation. Minor orientation wobble in the shrine sequence slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward Lior's final transformation into "the hand that reached into the between." The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role with the visible cost of leaving the familiar market behind ("She didn't look back"). Who/where/when anchors early through the dangling market setting, though some middle passages drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elias unmakes the mechanism, transforming ghosts from trapped performers to freed beings—"leaving the ghosts to their quiet, the circus to its dust, and the weightless burden of the past finally, mercifully, unwound." The accumulative lens holds as dust patterns, crack formations, and the mainspring barrel's warmth build toward this crystallized choice that forecloses the circus's potential restart.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's dissolution into the whisper he releases reweights the entire premise—he was the system constraining reality. The cost is visceral (his dissolution) and conceptual (the library's destruction enables awakening). The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns, frost, and whispers build density toward the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through the vision sequence where the cathedral briefly reassembles, forcing Taelis to carry "uneasy knowledge." The cost is visible—the shard turns to dust, permanently foreclosing this method. The hybrid lens holds, though the causal mechanism of the shard's power could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with undeniable cost: Elias trades his existence to undo the city's lie, becoming fire itself. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from "covenant of rust" through "reclamation" to the final transformation. Orientation anchors cleanly (Elias, resonance chamber, present-tense action).

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory details and psychometric fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts "the shape of [answer's] absence." Cost is legible in the burned notes and the shift from collecting petrichor to collecting silence, though the physical lagoon sequence could strengthen causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative closure where the archway-as-loom revelation reconfigures meaning and Elias's carved hand becomes another layer in time's weave. The cost is felt through his empty pockets but fuller understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries—postcards, glass layers, preserved flowers—culminating in Liora's Resonant Reconfiguration as she shifts from seeking to listening. The closure lands with clear cost: she abandons her artistic work and the pavilion itself, accepting that "some questions weren't meant to be solved / Only held." Orientation anchors (Liora, pavilion, end of winter) establish by line 3, and the pattern of revelation-through-stillness holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elias releases the diary into the lagoon, transforming from preserver to liberator with felt cost ("For the first time in decades, the past didn't feel like a chain"). The who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2, and the pattern of visions→artifacts→confrontation→release holds causally, though the Historical Revision Board's retreat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the town's revival through memory-as-alchemy lands with felt cost ("half-mad" persistence). The bottle's transformation from vessel for wishes to vessel for people creates strong causality. Minor weakness: the exact mechanics of memory-to-reality remain somewhat abstract, though the sensory cascade (scent→sound→touch) provides sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elias moves from archivist to "hinge" between choice and consequence, accepting his role as listener rather than recorder. The prophecy's emergence through ritual creates genuine pressure that reweights his understanding of his role. Cost is visible in his shaking hands and the weight of choosing not to record, though the conceptual price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as the chick transforms into sapling and drops a new acorn cap, with cost visible in the vortex's "thousand names unraveling." The accumulative lens holds as entropy reversal through memory creates the decisive shift, though the mechanics of "decreasing entropy" could be more precisely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias's rope adjustment enables the bell to "speak" rather than "scream," saving the valley. The accumulative build through sensory detail (wind's howl, bronze throats, whale-sinew) coheres at "the sound of something held carefully, deliberately, in balance." Cost is felt through the risk of the abbot calling it "reckless" and the stakes of valley flooding.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Eli accepts the star's light and the station transforms, with visible cost in leaving behind his old role. However, the shift from "The star flared in response" to systemic transformation feels rushed, lacking intermediate causality that would strengthen the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from silence and stasis through ghostly visitation to regeneration, with the honeycomb as pivotal transformation object. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the wasteland's transformation and the bees' return demonstrate visible cost (his disappearance) and reward (renewal). The covenant's untangling provides conceptual weight, though the exact mechanics of transformation could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing—time reconceived from linear to "garage sale" to "loom"—with felt cost in Elias's acceptance of unfinished work. The accumulative lens holds consistently through metaphorical layering. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the final transformation lacking a more visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the poet accepts incompleteness as the point, with felt cost in the final line "We are all just woven dawns, coming undone." The accumulative structure builds through layered images (feather, kite, boat) that each reweight the central question. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure with Tomas taking up the wire, showing the work continues beyond individual life with visible cost ("years"). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the ending. Orientation anchors established early (temple orchard, Elira as caretaker, terminal diagnosis).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Elara takes the figure's hand and enters the spiral path, with visible cost in her abandoned lab and the amber fly "remade." The accumulative structure coheres as sculptures rearrange, footprints persist, and the tower "remembers" - all reweighting the pilgrimage from pseudoscience to lived truth.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the garden's permanence against the coachman's dissolution, with visible cost in "his bones as quiet as the seed pods he'd buried." The accumulative structure coheres as sensory layers (tide, seeds, birds, battlefield memory) build toward regeneration, though the middle section's reflection on the battlefield slightly dilutes present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Rook's transformation from finder of the dead to being found himself, with visible cost in his entombment. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and recurring motifs (leaf, cylinder, script) build toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors land clearly by ~100 words. The closure's cost is felt through the vines tightening and Rook's willing surrender, though the conceptual weight slightly outpaces the visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Lira's leap through the anomaly achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the compass pointing "through" rather than north reweights all prior navigation metaphors with clear cost (abandoning the station, embracing uncertainty). The mother's voice and the final image of someone reaching for a sketchbook crystallize the cyclical nature of observation across time. Slight deduction for the abstract quality of "somewhere else" which softens the otherwise sharp closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the sky beginning to mend and the spire singing after the exchange. The causal chain from theft to swap to revelation to healing holds, with visible cost in the Keeper's emotional breakthrough and Lirien's risk. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the pattern of exchanges building toward transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught walking rituals building to Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora releases the wing-moments and the penumbra retreats. Cost is legible in her dissolution "into the dark" and the gallery's transformation. The chessboard's reassembly with unmoving pieces creates Charged Poise that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias accepting his role, with visible cost in the mercury residue and sealed door. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and recurring motifs (stone, language, seeds) build toward the final transformation. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by line 2-3, and causality tracks cleanly through discovery-understanding-acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the tapestry's threads accumulate meaning through physical manipulation until the closure reconfigures the tutor from exile to belonging, with cost visible in "scars, not sins." The village's unfreezing provides resonant reconfiguration. Deduction for slight orientation delay (village context emerges gradually) and some abstract phrasing around the labyrinth's function.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands powerfully as Liora's carved words shatter both the spire and the system of dispersed guilt: "every confession, every half-truth, every name they'd buried now twisting back upon them." The accumulative structure builds from individual transgression through systemic understanding to revolutionary action with clear cost—the spire's destruction and the elders' screams. The final image of carving truth "into the spire's remains, where the light would refract it forever" achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the alchemist transforms from repairer to "the gold that held the shattered world together." Cost is visceral—the workshop dissolves, their life's work unspools, yet they're "lifted" into becoming part of the statue's story. The orientation anchors (alchemist, workshop on acid sea, statue) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (painted shell, mirror's cracks, bioluminescent cave) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias chooses dissolution into the cave's eternal pause. Cost is visible in burning his paintings and the final submersion. The orientation anchors arrive late (~200 words) but serve the dreamlike accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates—the story builds through sensory accretion (vibrations, scent, cork's warmth) toward Resonant Reconfiguration when Harkin pockets the cork "like a secret." Cost manifests in "the clean, bright ache of dawn" and Harkin's shoulders sagging. Orientation anchors clearly (lighthouse, dawn, Elias/Harkin). Deduction for the boats' return feeling slightly convenient despite the whisper mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered calls, maps, and the censer foot's warming until the final image of Lena rolling fresh paper crystallizes her acceptance of this role (Earned Stasis). Cost is visible in "the weight in her chest" transforming to something "lighter"—she accepts helping others while carrying her own loss. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (signal station, cliffs, Lena).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure—Lior's burying of the eye forecloses the path to "revelation" with legible cost (his sister's death, the world's raw honesty). The constraint of the empathy virus shapes every tactic from occlusion to truffle-masking, and the final image of the ravine keeping secrets while he climbs away resonates with accumulated weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres beautifully as fragments of memory literally unfurl from the boutonnière, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts his role. The cost is legible in "the last breath of a drowning man pressed into the hands of the only soul willing to carry it." Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural drive through sensory accretion (bioluminescent fungi, iridescent ants, shifting door symbols) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias crosses through to honor his promise. Cost is legible in the twenty-three years lost and the sealed door behind him, though the child/promise backstory could anchor more concretely earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the queen's transformation fulfills a childhood bargain, with visible cost ("bones hummed...veins filling with their fire"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through firefly/starlight motifs. The cyclical warning structure ("next queen") effectively reweights the opening. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the transformation mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the shell's transformation from vessel to key to promise, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the jump literalizes their philosophical shift. Cost is felt in "The fall was weightless. The landing was not." and the physical/emotional vulnerability of their shared descent. Orientation anchors (ember nexus, twilight, Elias as alchemist) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly with "Soared" as conceptual repricing after burning the scrolls frees him from chronicler role. Temporal fragmentation pattern taught early and sustained. Cost is visible in the empty grave and acceptance of multiplicity. Slight opacity in the exact mechanics of time-looping doesn't obscure the closure's emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and object meditation build toward Elias's resonant reconfiguration about witnessing versus fixing. The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting limitation as its own form of understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the middle section's reflection density that briefly stalls present-frame momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through rune-work, scar transformation, and storm imagery, culminating in Lian's reconfigured stance toward change ("Now she understood it was the only time anything could change"). Cost is visible in the shedding quill tip and transformed scars. Slight deduction for the grandmother's wisdom feeling somewhat convenient rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the perfume's magic as connective tissue building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters accept loss while choosing renewal. The closure lands with felt cost—the orchard falls but earth "remembers the current"—creating a legitimate before/after through accumulated metaphorical weight. Slight opacity in the magic system's mechanics ("tendrils threading through walls") doesn't break causality but prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration - the witness transforms from end to beginning with visible cost (the library's collapse, history's erasure). The accumulative lens holds consistently. Deduction for abstract terminology ("spiral arbitration") that obscures rather than illuminates the central mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's transformation from "shepherd" to "gatekeeper" with visible cost (the new notch in the key). The accumulative structure coheres well through counting patterns and bleeding time imagery, though the ghost ship's appearance could use clearer causal grounding earlier. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena adds her pulse to the network and releases her grief—a Charged Poise moment where she chooses permeability over containment. Who/where/when anchors early (mushroom farm, 3 a.m. call), and the accumulative pattern of communication/connection imagery coheres at closure with felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught contradiction motif building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila steps into paradox itself. The closure lands with visible cost ("The mica pane cracked further") and conceptual repricing of luck as readable language. Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently by line 3. Minor deduction for slight ambiguity in the library's dissolution sequences—the rules of traversal could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - the final image of Elias humming off-key while waiting for the next call crystallizes his role with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, building texture through wrong numbers, glass harmonics, and tunnel atmosphere. Deduction for the slightly abstract concept of "teaching endings" which weakens cost legibility at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the archivist's ritual of transcription and the covenant "breathing" at closure. Cost is felt through "the bitterness became part of her" and the weight of preservation she carries, though the exact stakes of the "regenerated covenant" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lena's release of the moon rock and acceptance of motion without running reweights the entire reciprocal system. The accumulative structure coheres well with each exchange building toward the final understanding that "the cure wasn't in the holding. It was in the passing." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the virologist subplot's true nature.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the stillpoint discovery and resonant reconfiguration when Elian internalizes the stillpoint as navigational capacity. The closure lands with felt cost as grief becomes "mapped" rather than erased. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the ultrasonic forest concept.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts layering over erasure, with visible cost in his years of failed corrections. The pen writing before he writes it creates a meaningful pattern break. The walk to the hydroponic bays with uncertain seeds shows foreclosed certainty. Minor deduction for slightly abstract middle section about "contingent relationships" that momentarily loses concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the harbor transforms from empty silence to "alive" silence "humming just beneath the threshold of hearing." Cost is legible in "heavier now, like a heart full of names" and the transformation of forgotten songs into recovered memory. The faceless entity's dissolution and the waves' color-chord response create decisive change with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change: Elias burns the final archive after understanding his true motivation, with cost visible in "pockets empty, his hands unmarked by soot for the first time." The causal chain from discovery to understanding to final action holds. The promise/fire revelation lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural closure where Lira's drumming releases the entangled memories, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("for the first time in years, her mind was her own"). The pattern of water-memory-sound builds coherently to the release sequence. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the treatment's mechanics early on, though the ending's embodied action compensates well.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration—Lior's return to listening after proving his point about quiet persistence. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Cost appears in the foreclosed opportunity to leave permanently, though the emotional weight could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout as patterns of light and dark build toward the boy's emotional release and the father's parallel discovery of the mirror. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the boy's stance shifts from shame to understanding that "darkness wasn't the absence of stars—it was the space that let them shine," with felt cost in their unresolved separation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the library remains through collective action with visible cost (workers' aching teeth, town's "unspoken rhythm"). The accumulative lens holds as synchronized displays build to magnetic resistance. Minor deduction for slightly opaque causality around how the grotto's magnetism literally seals doors, though the pattern teaches itself adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from dock labor through the scrimshaw's vibration to full transformation, with the island-as-cage revelation reweighting all prior imagery. Cost is legible in Elias leaving behind his human form and the dockworkers' silent knowledge, though the whale's philosophical declarations slightly dilute the visceral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: from enforced silence to chosen silence, with the gift of dried flowers marking genuine connection. Cost is visible in "something like fear, something like hope" and the three-year weight of the Mandate's aftermath. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the Mandate backstory could integrate more smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira's transformation from poet to "something fluid and flickering" reweights the atrium from sacred containment to site of transformation, with clear cost in her dissolution of self. The accumulative structure coheres through the spiral walk building to the lake's answer. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of some transformative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through plant arrangements building to connection. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora's request to learn the language and their shared music-making crystallizes their bond with felt cost ("Some awakenings were worth any cost"). The phoenix cycle frames temporal urgency effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as the piece builds through sensory accumulation ("hum filled the room," "shadows pulsed") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes "the space between the notes." The closure lands with felt cost as she leaves the bell behind, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (past 120 words).

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through repeated folding/leaving actions that build to communal grief-sharing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena shifts from solitary mourning to teaching others, with cost visible in "hollow eyes" and winter timeline. Orientation anchored early (observatory, jewelry maker, post-funeral). Minor deduction for somewhat predictable arc from isolation to connection.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition and measurement as its organizing principle, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's role shifts from client-reader to cultural diagnostician. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the weight of predicting/preventing future crashes—though the emotional price remains oblique. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs with the loft setting and Elias's profession.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: "To purify is to let go" crystallizes through action as the pagoda dissolves into light and she walks away transformed. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern (saffron imagery, dissolution motifs) with visible cost in the "faded veil" and sealed archive.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered discoveries (stone → footage → poet's history → shadow exchange), with Resonant Reconfiguration landing when Liora's sacrifice transforms both shadows into peaceful guardians. Cost is visible in her thinned shadow and the line "tinged with regret—not for what was lost, but for the beauty of what remained," though the curator's protective lie feels slightly undermotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with layered metaphor of reconstruction. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias stepping forward into uncertain redemption, with visible cost in his ongoing guilt and the "weight to carry." However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated in places like "both fragile, both his to carry."

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("Some stories weren't meant to be read. They were meant to be carried"). The accumulative lens holds through metaphor density and pattern breaks. Deduction for slightly unclear causality around the telepathy's emergence and its exact relationship to the surgical scar.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and film fragments build toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elara realizes the love wasn't unused but "waiting for the right hands." The closure lands with felt cost as she accepts his goodbye and turns off the projector, foreclosing the search. Orientation anchors (projection booth, Elara as crystal gazer) establish clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes "the path" with clear cost—the archway dissolves, suggesting irreversible transformation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening paragraphs. Slight deduction for the convenience of the grandmother's instrument being perfectly suited without prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: Hollow's awakening to dream/memory parallels the world's renewal from dead earth to green sand. The chess clock as key, the spark's cultivation, and the train's transformation create coherent accumulative pressure with visible cost in "forty years of riding the iron veins of the dead earth" paid for this single moment of beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and philosophical fragments build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the philosopher realizes the frontier is internal. Cost is visible in leaving the gear behind. Orientation anchors (philosopher, mechanical rainforest, night) establish by ~100 words. Deduction for the middle section's causality becoming slightly opaque during the fractal clearing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Earned Stasis as Liora releases the punch and joins the vigil keepers, foreclosing her ferryman path with visible cost. The accumulative texture coheres through water/twilight/threshold imagery building to "the most important crossings are the ones you don't make." Orientation anchors clearly (Liora, ridgeway, after duty ends). Slight deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral in places.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's choice to stay and listen, with the fortress "answering" as visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (bolt warming, note in molars, snow falling like broken scales) build toward the crystallized moment where "remaining was its own kind of sound." Causality is clear: bolt discovery → following traces → finding pianist → understanding → choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change lands with Lirien's name as the price paid to unmake the false sovereign's claim. Causal lens holds: warnings lead to investigation, discovery demands sacrifice, sacrifice shatters the scepter and unmasks pretender. The cost is explicit and felt through the friendship's erasure. Slight deduction for the pretender's too-convenient relief lacking earlier setup.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lena's final step onto the revealed road, with visible cost in abandoning the station and Dr. Voss. The accumulative structure coheres through the tapping rhythm that literally calls forth the hidden path, though the mechanism of "eternal tides" and "periodic unraveling" remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the stones' awakening reweights the rebellion's meaning from "stalled" to "listening." Cost is legible in "wreckage," "scars," and the implied risk of reignition. The pattern of hum→roar→collective awakening builds coherently, though the transition from individual discovery to collective action could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory accretion (steam, black sand, whisper-vines) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the embryo's blooming transforms both physical space and social order. The closure lands with visible cost—Liora kneeling in mud, laughing as tradition literally rewrites itself through glowing tendrils that sing to skeptics. The orientation anchors (Liora, hot springs, post-war Reconstruction) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the photograph's journey from pocket to branch to absence, with each stage reweighting Lena's relationship to grief. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—she doesn't let go but "makes room," with visible cost in the empty pocket space and the physical pain she induces. The orientation anchors (arboretum, cliffs, fig trees) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Elara's dissolution into the dark reweights the entire narrative from failure to necessary transformation. The cost is felt through the lighthouse's consumption and her loss of individual form. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, library, Elara as artist) establish early and the pattern of fragmentation-to-wholeness holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's decision to follow rather than kill, with visible cost in his transformed body and the risk of stepping through. The causal lens holds as each discovery (the encampment victims, the thief's pattern, the broken spiral) drives Kael's tactical shift. Minor orientation delay with "no one here knew it" before establishing the "here."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: letter triggers investigation → discovery of conspiracy → decisive action → martyrdom with lasting systemic change. Closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (Elara's death) and Resonant Reconfiguration (archives now "speak back"). The revolution's echo beyond her death satisfies closure requirements, though the conspiracy revelation feels slightly rushed in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building density through rose-tending rituals toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora chooses to remain as keeper of quiet while the world burns—cost visible in her isolation. The pattern of father's phrases carved into tools/bark accumulates meaning, culminating in her decision to stitch the sandbag into the dome's seam as protective act.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sound-wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, and the goddess's mouth until the final letting-go reweights all prior pursuit with felt cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the fisher's renunciation forecloses the path of chasing echoes, with "somewhere, in the dark between sounds, his daughter's voice finally stopped calling" marking the decisive shift. The orientation anchors (fisher, sound wave garden, night) establish by ~50 words, though the fantastical elements take longer to cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure: journalist's challenge → ledger discovery → plates arrival → decision to publish, with each beat narrowing Lydia's options. The closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost (betraying father's memory to honor mother's work), though the plates' arrival timing feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's shift from trying to erase guilt to witnessing it, with cost visible in "more stars to ink." The accumulative structure coheres through the amber/mosquito transformation and time-fold device. Deduction for orientation wobble—the laboratory's purpose and Elara's role as "constellation tattooist" remain somewhat unclear past the 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns densify from chalk mural to mandala to the final void-drawing, with each iteration deepening Lior's commitment. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "Some things were meant to be devoured" - accepting dissolution as creation's cost. Who/where/when anchored early ("grotto," "Lior," "unlearning week").

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost when the commander joins Elias's work, crystallizing a Charged Poise where both men cradle sorrow "in arms of steel and shattered light." The accumulative pattern of naming stones builds to this reconfiguration of enemy-to-participant. Cost is legible in "my son's name"—the commander's personal loss that reweights his prior violence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elias steps "into the *next act*" with the coin, foreclosing suicide. Cost is legible through Lydia's fading and acceptance of her recurring ghostly role. The fractured timeline and synesthetic layering create coherent pressure toward this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through light-as-pathway revelation building to Charged Poise closure where Lena stands at the painted door. The "Let's go find her" decision with cat in arms lands with emotional cost—choosing connection over skepticism. The sliver's dissolution into skin and door's heartbeat pulse create visceral stakes. Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the telepathy pill exposition section.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and fossil interactions build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Lior becomes the caves' cartographer. Closure lands with visible cost (fossil lifting, cave answering in vibration) and the final image of rain as promise reweights the journey. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (caves, Lior, post-hibernation setting).

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the hourglass reverses itself and Elias chooses to leave the button rather than complete his pattern, with visible cost in accepting human fracture over temporal control. The accumulative structure coheres through button-gathering toward this crystallized moment, though the prophecy's exact mechanics remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with Lena's decision crystallizing between past trauma and future action, cost visible in leaving the pillbox behind. The hybrid lens holds—accumulative texture builds to causal choice. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (specific location unclear until "Zephyr Bluff") and the man's arrival feeling somewhat convenient despite the coded message setup.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the passing of the needle creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—the promise transfers, the girl walks upstream, the cycle continues with visible cost (her departure from mother). The palimpsest promise's layered instructions ("When the fog lifts twice...") drive causality effectively, though the girl's foreknowledge feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (bowl, glass, bee, honey scent) building toward a Conceptual Repricing where "resistance is remembrance." The cost is visible in the abandoned bowl left behind and his solitary return to the dying village. Orientation anchors (potter, abandoned oasis, dying world) establish by ~100 words, and the fractured timeline concept pays off through overlapping temporal perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds density through garden decay, gauge tooth accumulation, and harbor rhythm until the final image of belief in "an open door" crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("for the first time in years"). The pattern of locked/unlocked deepens from physical tools to emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lior's realization that "to translate isolation into independence was to stop asking for forgiveness," with visible cost in releasing the Hesperornis and stepping through previously unopened doors. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern breaks (the bird striking its reflection, the book of mirrors appearing) build toward the final reconfiguration where both beings accept their status as "ones who refused to stay dead."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora commits to "following the thread, one secret at a time" with the mysterious twig as physical proof of transformation. The accumulative lens holds as images (spirals, orbs, threads) build density toward this reweighting. Cost is visible in surrendering both spirals, though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern accumulates through signal-to-social fracture correlations, building to Liora's intervention that shifts the alien signal from predatory to curious—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The closure lands with "The universe was still talking. And now, so was she," crystallizing her changed stance from passive interpreter to active participant. Orientation anchors effectively (Liora, radio station basement, present-tense crisis).

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spatial mutiny that pays off when the chamber rearranges and Elias must choose to drive the key home, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city's blueprint rewrites itself. Cost is visible in the spatial threat and the inherited burden, though the ending's conceptual repricing ("Prudence had brought him this far. Rebellion would take him the rest of the way") could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias becomes "a portraitist of the invisible, a lance for the silent" with visible cost in carrying what he cannot see. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and memories layer to reveal Liora's erasure. Orientation anchors clearly (quarry, mist, Elias descending) and the before/after shift from failed witness to active carrier of silenced truths registers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal lens holds as Elias's discovery leads to testing the nail, which tears reality and forces his choice to destroy the evidence. Closure lands through Earned Stasis with visible cost (burning the journal, accepting the door stays closed), though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the glass flake serving as catalyst for transformation from mundane pullout to threshold. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias becomes the song itself, with visible cost (dissolution of identity). However, the mechanics of how playing the fiddle opens the road remain opaque, slightly weakening causality at the critical transition.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Elias's decision to walk away without wondering "what came next" forecloses his inherited path with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (foreign money, bent cage bars, father's lessons) layer to reweight the central question of circular paths versus spirals, though the cost could be more visceral at the actual closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias joining the chorus of shared burdens - "I witness. I share. I am not alone" crystallizes the transformation with clear cost (surrendering his ledger). The accumulative lens holds consistently through celestial imagery and inscription reveals, though the sister's role could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaks that reweight meaning: the lake's transformation from wound to conscious keeper, the seed's digestion revealing truth, and Eldrin's shift from seeker to bearer of unwanted knowledge. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Eldrin walks away with the key, accepting some wounds should bleed—with visible cost in his deliberate not-hearing of the lake's renewed hum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes the covenant's keeper, with visible cost in her transformed scars now blooming. The hybrid lens holds adequately though the shift from textural to causal could be smoother. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Liora, glade, listening to willow).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered trades and root/bone imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora accepts her scars as "hers to carry." The orchard's rules establish clear causality (trades extracted/given), and the closure lands with felt cost as she walks away "lighter" but still scarred. Minor orientation wobble with "corridors" appearing late without clear spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Liam's acceptance of uncertainty as generative rather than failure, with visible cost in his career pivot and isolation. The accumulative structure coheres as memories layer meaning onto the cloth discovery. Deduction for the somewhat abstract "space between notes" metaphor that doesn't fully land with embodied cost, though the driving-into-uncertainty image partially recovers it.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformed relationship to loss—"held now in a light that let him see both at once." The accumulative pattern of translation/transition metaphors coheres, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the reunion scene itself rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the creel transforms from artifact collection to repository of human transitions, with clear cost in the moon's physical toll on Elias. The closure lands with "possibilities" replacing "objects," showing genuine transformation. Slight opacity in the middle prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the inspector transforms from seeker to bearer, with visible cost ("the pearl was gone now, its light woven into the fabric of the world"). The accumulative lens holds as confessions layer toward the decisive moment of accepting the pearl, though the final spreading of light borders on convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Elias turns right (choosing "sorry") with visible cost—the abandoned chronicler role and acceptance of guilt. The accumulative lens holds as graffiti wisdom builds toward this crystallized choice. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density shifts that reweight meaning, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dreamer chooses direct speech over the cipher's indirect revelations. Cost is legible in "her heart no longer a cipher, but a door" and the abandoned watch. Minor orientation wobble with the confidence man's temporal position but recovers through the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure with visible cost—Elara destroys the violin and accepts being labeled a thief/madwoman. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and plant consciousness build toward the final crystallization. Strong causality from coffee-stain prophecy through plant urging to final choice. Minor deduction for slightly rushed transition from playing to destroying without showing the full weight of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora receives the message "it was beautiful" and accepts her role as messenger between living and dead. The cost is visible in how she now carries "the knowledge that thresholds were not walls, but breaths held between two notes of a song." The accumulative texture builds through aurora patterns, the emerald chip's pulse, and the grotto's shifting frequencies to create meaningful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Maren's transformation from seeking "the source" to actively "scalloping bandages" for incoming children, with visible cost in the silver fruit exchange. The accumulative pattern coheres well through scallop motifs. Slight opacity in the grotto's mystical mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias shifts from rigid certainty to "protected vulnerability," with the lighthouse beam changing from steady guide to questioning pulse—cost visible in abandoning his polished routine. Accumulative/textural lens holds as details (shard whispers, unhooked threads, wind chimes) build pressure toward stance crystallization. The woman's arrival and staying provides external confirmation of internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught ripples building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias steps into the dark, accepting the grotto's pull. The cost is legible in his bones creaking with "years both lived and unlived" and the surrender of control. Orientation anchors (floating rock, Dr. Vey, grotto) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through resonance patterns (stone/bone/echo) toward the Charged Poise ending where the skimmer becomes the anchor, with clear cost in accepting the hunter's presence. The transformation from observer to tower/echo lands with conceptual weight. Slight opacity around the Hollow Maw's exact nature doesn't damage closure but prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Marlin refuses the Conservatory's demand to explain, walking out with his transformed candle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as images (candle, keystone, light) accumulate meaning through the climb. Cost is visible in his rejection of "mastery" and the keystone abandonment. Minor orientation wobble with "mist walking" transition deducts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic resonances build toward Elias's final vow, with the shimmer of waves marking a Resonant Reconfiguration. The journey from physical library to metaphysical crucible traces cleanly, though the frozen sky sequence briefly strains comprehension before resolving into earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Liora's reversal of universal contraction lands as Conceptual Repricing—the prophecy was "always about the choice to turn around." The cost is isolation: she alone carries the memory of dissolution while others wake innocent. The causal chain from coins-as-keys to harmonic resonance to temporal reversal holds, though the mechanics of universe-reversal stretch plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the naming ritual that transforms both fears and monsters into tangible threats. The cost is explicit: "regret was just another kind of fear, and he had no room left to carry it." The accumulative lens holds as imagery density increases toward the crystallization scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's success in synchronizing the bell with the viaduct's rhythm, creating a before/after shift from "End of Tides" to the bay's revival. The causal chain from observation to theory to action is clear, and cost appears in "fingers bled" and "weight of a vow kept," though the emotional price could be more visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with photographs building density toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elias shifts from guarding against the past to letting it breathe. The cost is legible in "reaching not to pull him under, but to lift" and his changed role from warden to son, though the middle section could tighten the pressure-to-release arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - she crosses into transformation accepting that "some things are meant to be held, not solved." The cost is legible in losing her former self and the old world "fading." Accumulative lens holds throughout with density shifts marking progression.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal chain drives to Decisive Change: Elara secures the atmospheric pressure device, preventing weaponization. Cost is visible in her solitary burden ("Some burdens weren't meant to be shared") and the physical/emotional toll. However, the stakes of the device itself remain somewhat abstract—we understand it's dangerous but not its specific threat, slightly weakening the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael merges his split selves, paying the visible cost of pain and risk to defeat numbness—the final image of stepping "into the dawn" with a "whole" heart reweights the opening's fractured state. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered details (jar pulses, blood ritual, dojo rising) toward this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the escape room literally becomes "outside" and the puzzle transforms from mechanical solving to organic patience. The cost is visible - "Business slowed. Then it stopped" - and the closure lands with "Now we see what grows," crystallizing the shift from controlled puzzles to open-ended cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building through the tunnel's acoustic transformations until real laughter emerges. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias abandons his conductor role, with visible cost in leaving the blower behind "like an accusation." The hourglass's final fullness provides conceptual repricing, though the family's sudden emotional breakthrough strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyssa's dissolution into the veil represents both Earned Stasis (accepting her role) and transformation with visible cost ("weight of words lifting from her bones"). The pendant exchange catalyzes the unraveling sequence causally. Cost is legible in the dissolution imagery and the line "finally brave enough to close."

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the crystallized ending where Elias achieves vivification through "interrupting death at the root." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the guild flees, world remakes). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract conceptualization of vivification mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands with visible transformation as Elara literally rises when "gravity...had been another assumption all along." The accumulative structure builds coherently through fragment-dish-frequency-transformation, with cost implied in the shattering dish and the necessary leap. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the radio tower city's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the ferry vanishing "exactly where it was supposed to be" crystallizes the permanent-transient paradox with clear cost (passengers remembering "both lives"). The accumulative lens holds as patterns literally "snap into place like gears." Orientation anchors (ferry, grotto, Lira as deckhand) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the gallery "resolves" and visitors recognize themselves in each other, with clear cost in the dissolved illusions. The accumulative structure coheres well. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (gallery purpose unclear until paragraph 3) and the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Veythar's navigators plot "courses into the deep sky," with the chain link transformed from anchor to instrument of ascension. The accumulative structure coheres through the chain's evolving meaning. Cost is legible in abandoning old navigation methods. Slight opacity in the aliens' teaching methods prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through sensory details toward the photograph revelation as Resonant Reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchored early through "atrium," "twilight," "hearing aid." Cost is visible in the line "For when you forget" - implying cycles of loss. Deduction for slight ambiguity about whether this is supernatural or psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres well - each discovery (the seam, the phase transition, the junction box) deepens the mystery while building toward Elias's commitment to return. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through his transformed relationship to confined spaces and the unremembered, with visible cost in his willingness to be "unraveled." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Lena transitions from counting down to counting "with," though the mechanism of the observatory's consciousness feels slightly convenient. The accumulative build through static, ink patterns, and fragmented transmissions coheres well. Cost is visible in her three-year haunting and the porcelain shard's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building toward Veyra's absorption into the canyon's echoes—a Decisive Change with clear cost. The closure lands powerfully with "echoes are just sounds that have forgotten how to die" reweighting the entire premise. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed transformation sequence where causality accelerates beyond the established pace.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias becomes part of the garden's "harmony untamed," cost visible in his transformation. Strong causality from arrowhead discovery through phone confession to final metamorphosis, though the multiple endings after "The end, or the beginning" dilute impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mechanical world transforms to organic life through the violinist's heart-rhythm communication, with clear cost in the melting statues and fraying sky-bridge. The accumulative texture coheres—from skeletal trees to blooming petals, from brass gears to living roots—creating undeniable before/after through pattern reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds through mail/storm/absence motifs toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where undelivered letters find release, with cost visible in Elias's scar and ongoing risk ("The drones would be back soon"). The pattern teaches itself early through the arcade bells and patrol cycles, though the transition to the haunted post office feels slightly abrupt without stronger causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic fragments build toward Lior's transformation from listening to building. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when silence shifts from retreat to offering to door-building, with emotional cost visible in his smile before beginning anew.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration lands with felt cost—the scarf dissolves permanently into the library's architecture, transforming both space and protagonist ("He was a fold in the story now"). The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the library's transformation, with clear before/after: from static repository to living, breathing space where "lines curved forever."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through light/photography imagery building to the dream's dissolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the librarian chooses to let the dream fade rather than cage it, with visible cost in the "single watercolor smear" and her later salt-dampened pillow. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherence, though the dream's exact nature could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the locksmith's realization that locks protect as much as imprison reweights the entire premise, with the girl "waking with a name on her lips she'd never dared speak" showing tangible change. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphysical imagery build toward the final transformation. The cost is felt through the locksmith's choice to keep her own mother's locket unopened, accepting certain mysteries. Slight deduction for the man's sudden disappearance feeling somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure as the constellation "knitting itself back together" creates Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("heavy and bright as a starfall"). The fairy ring dissolving and memory restoration land with weight. Slight dock for the rushed final confrontation that could use one more beat to fully dramatize the reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Kael learns to bind shadows and annotate thresholds, with visible cost in "fingers still smudged with tea and something older." The accumulative lens holds as tea leaves, shadows, and mirrors layer into a coherent system. Orientation anchors (library, afternoon, two characters) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the veil crossing serving as the decisive turn where Elias discovers the fading orchard layer and chooses to give rather than take. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as he transforms from shaper to conduit, with visible cost in his disappearance and the children's recognition of impossible colors. The seed's transformation from heirloom to bridge and the silver sapling's appearance confirm the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias releases the spirits by letting the knot unravel, transforming from restorer to "door." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through layered imagery (prisms, nets, silence) toward the final release with clear cost: "Behind him, the prisms shattered." The orientation anchors early ("prism sanctuary," "Elias knelt") and the closure lands with both felt and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise as Elara discovers the tear marks time rather than space, with cost visible in her choice to "return to the surface with no proof." The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details (dripping ceiling, humming stones, flickering films) build toward the crystallized realization that "silence was a language," though the orientation takes slightly too long to anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through Liora's decision to let go, carrying clear emotional cost. The snow globe's physics defying gravity and the lighthouse beam pulsing create pattern breaks that reweight meaning. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through graffiti symbols, the ghost's answers, and the bolt plate's warmth until the final slam creates decisive change—the ghost dissolves and transfers to the valley child. Cost is legible in the balladeer's "raw throat with words he'd never sing" and his shadowless departure. The constraint of encoding rather than singing shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with legitimate Conceptual Repricing closure where "cold was just the price of seeing clearly" reweights the entire spire experience with visible cost. The diary discovery builds through data interpretation to revelation about joy-seeking, culminating in Liora's laugh and continued ascent. Minor deduction for slightly rushed transition between cipher discovery and understanding its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase and pattern breaks that successfully reweight the dominant stake. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's surrender/integration with the sky, with visible cost in his acceptance of falling "into" rather than down. The gondola's string breaking and reforming as light provides clear before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she paints "nothing" and "lets the limits hold her," with clear cost in abandoning her lifelong pursuit. The accumulative lens holds as patterns of failed containment build to acceptance. Deduction for mild orientation delay (the oak library context emerges gradually) and some causality softness around how the coin's indentations become her blueprint.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Liora's pattern-recognition transforms the ship from trapped to free, with cost visible in weeks of drift and crew desperation. The hopscotch board functions as both literal navigation tool and metaphorical key, teaching its pattern early and paying off through physical escape. Causality holds throughout, though the magical mechanics of "stranded luminance" could be slightly more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the locksmith retrieves the watch and opens the distant door, with visible cost in years spent learning "the language of mechanisms." The accumulative lens holds as gear-work and mirror-water cohere into the hall-as-clock revelation. However, the sister's disappearance backstory arrives late (60% mark) without earlier grounding, creating mild causality strain.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "We stay" - transforming the nebula from escape to building-with, with cost visible in the war-scarred soil and collective effort required. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details (chalk messages, bell-ringing, butterfly garden) layer toward the final reweighting of "respite." Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with Liora on Veyth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the puppet head triggering Elias's decisive action to unspool time's stolen moments, accepting his own dissolution. The closure lands with visible cost ("Elias stayed until the stars remembered how to blink") and resonant reconfiguration. Slight opacity around "nested patterns" mechanics prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Liora's shift from isolation to active guidance reweights the orchard's curse and labyrinth's purpose. The blueprint discovery causally enables her secret path-marking system, and the final image of "a traveler walked free" while mechanical birds freeze crystallizes her choice's cost and meaning. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elias shifts from building to flowing, with visible cost in releasing the chrysalis. The ravine's divergent/convergent paths establish the governing metaphor early and pay off through his final wading in.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the progression from empty shop to first transaction to renewed waiting, with closure landing as Charged Poise: "The slate was waiting." The cost manifests in Liora's acceptance of her role as "keeper of clean slates, dealer in absences"—she enables others' stories while remaining forever at the threshold, never the author.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward Elias's release of the soldier's memory into the pavilion, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The closure lands cleanly with "Not anymore" signaling his temporary reprieve, though the middle section could tighten the causal link between tasting memories and needing to deposit them.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through language fragments, musical metaphors, and the weight's symbolic journey to a Resonant Reconfiguration where multilingual cooperation replaces isolation. Closure lands with "singing in the same key" but cost remains more implied than felt—we see the ledger and translations but not the actual friction of implementation. The orientation is clear (clock tower, Liora, silent elevator) and structure coheres, but the transformation feels too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lena transforms from engineer/archeologist to "cartographer of the entangled dark," with the cost visible in her physical collapse and acceptance of fractured memories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memory fragments build toward this crystallization. The closure lands with felt cost as she embraces the fractures rather than seeking precision.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lysara holds the seed "between her ribs," poised to return transformed. Cost is visible in her years of searching and the grotto's one-hour window. The causal chain holds (manuscript→grotto→seeds→brother's guidance→planting decision) though the magical mechanics feel slightly convenient. Who/where/when anchored early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the siskins take up the melody and the grove will "remember," transforming silence into perpetual song. The cost is legible in Elias leaving the salt-clouded insulator behind - "Some things were meant to stay." The accumulative lens holds throughout as density increases toward this crystallized ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the chess-covenant metaphor until the final Resonant Reconfiguration where playing becomes listening and the covenant transforms from broken to waiting. Closure lands with visible cost: Elias releases his worry stone (his coping mechanism) to the next generation. The magnetic nexus anchors setting early and constrains the final chess pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through catalogued silences to the final reconfiguration where Elias opens his workshop. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: abandoning his isolation to engage with others' brokenness. The diary functions as the causal engine, each entry building toward Elias's stance crystallization. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Liora's realization that "serenity...wasn't in stillness, but in the sway itself" constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (theft exposed, Elders' judgment faced). The corpse flower as mirror device accumulates meaning through scent/vision/truth revelations, and the final unlocked vault shows communal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating density through inversion, moss growth, and the seed's transformation into a singing sapling. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Veyra becomes symbiotic with the planet's resilience system, with visible cost in her physical transformation and her mentor's loss. The orientation anchors (orchard pilot, glider cockpit, inversion beginning) establish clearly by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Veyra's shifted understanding—from investigator to witness of something adaptive and alive. The cost is visible in her torn sleeve, shattered instrument, and fundamental change from someone who documents to someone who listens. However, the "city had learned" revelation, while atmospheric, lacks the concrete specificity that would elevate this to excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building toward Liora's transformation of both aurora and village. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora "joining" rather than translating the world, with clear cost: the elders' displeasure and the irreversible breaking of "centuries" of enforced silence. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively ("ice cavern," "Liora, the prism-song bell ringer").

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms from guardian to navigator, with the cost visible in abandoning thirty years of purpose and the world's protective weave fraying. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (bones, flute notes, driftwood patterns) build toward the final reweighting where "the weave, at last, breathed easy."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias transforms from printer to page, with cost visible in releasing borrowed emotions. The halo fragment's evolution from die to mirror to dissolved ink tracks causally. Slight dock for the abstract "mathematics of emotion" concept that takes time to ground in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the courier becomes what his mentor became—the hum itself—with clear cost (dissolution into the fade). The accumulative structure builds through layered transformations (pendant vibrating → seeds germinating → bridge forming → stories blooming), though the orientation could anchor "who" more clearly in the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (frost moving, prism glowing) that reweight meaning toward Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost—blood from cut palms, years of tension released. The orientation anchors (arbor, dawn, Elias) establish by ~60 words. Slight deduction for the ambiguous "some proofs were better left unproven" which feels slightly disconnected from the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught weaving metaphor that accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where both lovers commit to lifetime-spanning reciprocal sacrifice. Closure lands with unmistakable cost: the spinner becomes "part of the forest's breath, her bones woven into the roots." The parallel structure of her sacrifice and his response creates meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from personal discovery through descent to planetary awakening, with the silk's "barter" whispers providing textural coherence. The closure—smith and planet both awakening through the act of listening—lands with conceptual cost (the silk spent, the risk taken). Minor orientation wobble around the floating arches' physics slightly dulls early clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Liora becomes the map) with clear cost—abandoning the known world. The accumulative pattern of shards/seams/weights builds coherently. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (spaceport context emerges gradually) and some opacity around the man's identity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: Elias moves from death-haunted isolation to life-affirming connection through the accumulated weight of letters, stones, and glass. The cost is legible in "The skiff would rot at the dock. / Let it." The accumulative structure coheres as each element (glass, letters, stones) deepens the central question of safety and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (light behavior, shadow responses) building toward Earned Stasis—Liora's acceptance of eternal duty with isolation as cost. The cyclical structure ("climb again") reinforces this reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, Liora, ritual) establish clearly by ~100 words. Cost appears in her severed connection to villagers who "didn't call her anything."

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as images and encounters build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts his role as story-facilitator, with clear cost: "He painted until his arms burned, until the wing dissolved into his palm." The closure lands with the heart settling into "its new rhythm, no longer borrowed, but his own," though the middle journey section could tighten its causality between villages.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds from finding the sextant through dismantling it to understanding how trees absorb sorrow, culminating in Elias's acceptance of his role as one who "passes sorrow along." The resonant reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—the weight trees carry. Deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the labyrinth setting and for some causality softness in how the sextant's pieces disappear.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memories and harmonies until the closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration—Liora becoming the song itself with visible cost (her release/transformation). The causality holds as each sung memory builds pressure, causing the trees to respond and eventually the mirror world to sing back. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the final image of dissolved mica windows and passed light completes the transformation with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lena transforms from hiding to answering, with visible cost in facing Voss and her guilt. The accumulative structure coheres through paradoxes and mirrors. Minor opacity around Voss's manifestation mechanics, but the emotional logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the bakery's return, with felt cost in the prince's weeping and the city's years of "adjusting" to wrongness. The accumulative pattern (bread→wheat→baking→distribution→return) builds coherently. Slight opacity around the causal mechanism of the bakery's disappearance/return prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increase toward the woman's appearance and invitation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias steps onto the bridge, library dissolving (visible cost), reaching for connection. The "vow kept" and world remaking itself provides felt transformation with legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: father's death → inherited debts/routes → hunting Veyne → trapping him with false promises → market justice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Lena walks away having "made her peace with the breaking," with felt cost in carrying this knowledge "like the fob—polished smooth, heavy with meaning."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lira becoming the convergence point between sky and earth, with visible cost (ring dissolving into her veins, losing her role as observer). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward transformation. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and the abstract "forests holding elections" that never fully clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Decisive Change where Elias breaks from monochrome restraint to color expression, with visible cost (abandoning the locksmith legacy). The lock-as-key mechanism linking to hidden paints is slightly convenient but the emotional causality holds. Strong closure with "The last echo wasn't laughter this time. It was the sound of a seal breaking."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the Archive discovery, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias chooses raw honesty over gilded safety. The cost is visible in "he let the words bleed" and the physical transformation of his breathing, with the zinc plate's transformation marking the change.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through sensory patterns toward the ice's shattering—a Resonant Reconfiguration where destruction becomes dissemination ("a thousand tiny bells...scattering into the sky like seeds"). Cost is legible in the dissolution and Liora's acceptance of transience. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the fire as decisive change that reconfigures Elias's relationship to containment, landing with clear cost (leaving his purpose). The box discovery triggers meaningful escalation toward the controlled burn decision. Minor weakness in the transition between fire and dawn feeling slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries (locket → mailbox → letter → community response). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community begins writing their own letters, with visible emotional cost in Mrs. Delgado's trembling hands. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression from discovery to community transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira chooses dissolution over preservation, making the scientist's fear-encryption meaningful through her dance and final ascent. The closure lands with clear cost—the lab's destruction and her transformation from knowledge-seeker to knowledge-carrier. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the underwater setting.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the protagonist accepts that memories are "stored" not lost, with visible cost in his resigned return to work knowing "it would kill him." The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-based discovery. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of what exactly happens in the chamber - the "excavation" concept needs clearer grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the summoner accepts partial success ("not a scream, just a sigh") and finds peace with this incomplete victory, foreclosing her years of pursuit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery intensifies (brook→origami→lattice→shattered surface) toward the crystallized moment of acceptance. Cost is visible in "her solitude pressing in like a second skin" and the years spent chasing echoes, though the exact stakes of the prophecy remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through repeated lessons building to revelation. Strong closure as Elias becomes the new tutor (Decisive Change) with visible cost—he's now bound to the building's grief. The cyclical structure reinforces the trap. Minor orientation wobble with Veyra's sudden disappearance, but the pattern justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora's transformation into "library/quiet/light" and the garden's permanent resonance create clear before/after with visible cost (her capture). The accumulative structure builds coherently through memory archiving to systemic rebellion. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the quarantine's exact nature, though this serves the textural revelation pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the Emperor's transformation and the forger's teaching create a new future, with visible cost in the burned seals and seventeen years of treason. The thorn's dissolution unlinking the decrees provides clear causality. The conceptual cost of shared sorrow and the weight of the dead lands powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong closure with Decisive Change—Veyra moves from seeker to renouncer, understanding and rejecting the universe's secret song. The cost is visible in her deliberate destruction of the shell and walking away "without looking back." The causal chain from discovery to confrontation to renunciation holds firmly, though the nexus's rules could be slightly clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lena's acceptance of selective salvaging reweights the entire premise with visible cost ("The cracks were how the light got in"). The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images of glass, ice, and light that gain weight with each return. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the piece builds through ritual repetition (whisk stirring, net-mending, whistling) toward Liora's recognition that hidden patterns exist "because they're seen." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora picking up the whisk to continue the cycle, with cost implied in dedicating herself to invisible labor.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern recognition, static air, lead-lined pit, and diamond discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes "refracted" into multiple selves. The cost is visible—his disappearance and transformation—though the "garden/fertilizer" revelation feels slightly rushed in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change as Elias transforms from listener to prophet, with visible cost in the world's transformation below ("It wouldn't know what hit it"). The accumulative structure coheres through radio frequencies, glass imagery, and the dawn/knife motif building to the final scalpel image. Orientation anchors arrive by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "city that shouldn't exist yet" which never fully clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elias accepts that "redemption wasn't in holding tight but in letting go," with visible cost in his years of isolation now reframed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and the girl's arrival as pattern break, though the final paragraphs slightly over-explain the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the engineer becomes a living frequency to stabilize the artifact, with clear cost ("nerves rewriting themselves"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds toward the transformation. The piece teaches its sonic/vibrational logic early and pays it off through "forgiven by physics." Minor deduction for slight orientation delay on the artifact's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with the viaduct's ascension as Charged Poise—options crystallized, cost felt through Lior's isolation from the sanctuary. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds from frozen lake to rising bridge. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for the viaduct's physics remaining somewhat opaque despite being central to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (water/drought, Underground Railroad, buried histories) culminating in Elias's decision to expose the conspiracy. The closure—choosing to excavate truth despite drowning risk—lands with clear cost ("even if it drowned him too"). Pattern of water/burial/excavation coheres throughout, though the conspiracy revelation feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from the clockwork heart's arrival through Elias's realization that "mercy wasn't something you gave. It was something you built." The closure lands with visible cost - Elias finally writing the letters he'd avoided for years. Slight weakness in the extended denouement after the primary closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Pip transforms from falling to "conducting," with the workshop's destruction as visible cost. The kaleidoscope visions effectively forecast and pay off the transformation. Deduction for slight ambiguity in how exactly the arrow enables the conducting shift—the mechanism could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage from discovery of the patch through to Lena's deletion, with the recurring numbers serving as both mystery and key. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost—Lena sacrifices her existence to restore the erased crew. Minor orientation wobble with "neural lace" and worldbuilding details that arrive late without full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Charged Poise closure—Elias stepping forward as the mirrors shatter crystallizes his transformation with clear cost (abandoning his observer role). The fragment-vision-mirror pattern accumulates effectively toward this reconfiguration. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how exactly the visions work.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) - Lior's choice to stay and listen carries visible cost through canceled appointment and acceptance of "slow unraveling." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from silence to ice-walking to final listening. Deduction for the "E.M./Endings Matter" turn feeling forced rather than organic to the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres well, building from the abandoned pavilion through memory layers to Lior's acceptance of dual truths. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through his shifted understanding, with cost visible in "the weight of it felt lighter"—acknowledging years of burden. However, the reflection-to-present ratio pushes against the 30% allowance without sufficient present-frame micro-choices to fully justify it.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis closure—Lysan's consecration temporarily stabilizes the clearing against the prophet's erasure, with cost visible in "the weight in her chest eased just enough to breathe." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from whispers to song to stabilized borders. Minor orientation friction with "conjured clearing" and pavilion relationship slightly dulls early comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds through image layers—photographs of reaching hands, the factory ruins, the girl with butterfly—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where individual grief transforms into collective healing. The cost is legible in lines like "the town still carried that sound in its ribs" and the baker's son who "once clenched in rage." However, the mechanism of transformation through photography arrangement could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through crystal distortions building to the revelation that "growth hadn't stopped. It had gone underground." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias takes the woman's hand, foreclosing solitary investigation with felt cost ("reticent no longer"). The pattern-teaching through crystal echoes pays off in the final image of whispered futures.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elias releases his pattern of marking/locating, with visible cost in abandoning his role as "junkyard prophet." The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through the tape's return, the sculpture's animation, and the final shore scene. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words despite the dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias achieves Earned Stasis by leaving the hand spinning and walking away, with visible cost of abandoning his life's work. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphysical observations build toward his transformation. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, Elias as repair technician) establish clearly within opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory details and the vinyl shard's transformation from talisman to release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena drops the shard—a visible renunciation with cost ("not a surrender, but a release"). Deduction for slight ambiguity in the cost's specificity; while the gesture is powerful, the exact price of letting go could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara crosses through the sun into a library of sealed doors, accepting transformation with visible cost ("becoming a shadow"). The pattern of keys/doors/loops builds density toward the final image. Cost is legible in her acceptance of becoming what others feared, though causality occasionally relies on unexplained world mechanics (the Spooning's effects).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora gains the ability to "set the world." The garden-bargain-restoration sequence maintains causality, but the brother's seamless return ("palms smooth and unmarked") undermines the cost that should accompany such transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres through the light/stillness metaphor building to the knowledge transfer as closure - a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "pearl of stillness" finds its next keeper with visible cost (the weight of understanding). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—the pendant transfer and shared moss-planting create Charged Poise where both characters crystallize new stances toward healing. Cost is visible in Lena giving up her protective talisman and accepting vulnerability. The viral confession backstory integrates well but occasionally pulls focus from the present scene's accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure works—Elias dissolving into his story with "his edges softening" creates clear before/after with felt cost (his physical existence). The accumulative structure coheres through water/current imagery, though the middle section's parade of cameo figures feels slightly mechanical before finding its rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira shifts from tinkerer to "keeper of songs," with visible cost in her physical struggle and what she "almost let die." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the arbor's revival, though the resolution's completeness ("the world felt whole") slightly undercuts the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the alchemist's understanding shifts from "preserving light" to "teaching it how to stay"—a conceptual repricing with clear cost in her isolation and endless labor. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-work building to this revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the timer's single tick "like a heartbeat catching up to itself" after the locksmith departs, leaving his reconstruction running—a Charged Poise that crystallizes the tension between holding and releasing time. The accumulative lens holds as metaphoric density increases toward this final image. Cost appears in "his throat tightened" and the conscious choice to abandon control.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered weights until Elira's recognition "She was not the weaver. She was the loom" reweights everything with clear cost—her dissolution into the grotto. The orientation anchors (grotto, Elira, collecting weights) establish by ~100 words. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: she becomes part of the grotto's eternal function.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she keeps the lion "Not as a ghost, but as a lesson." The accumulative structure builds through carving iterations to this decisive break in pattern, with cost visible in "One cut at a time" accepting perpetual letting-go.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (camera wheel, lagoon, carousel) that reweight at closure when Lira lets herself be pulled under. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as she accepts being "remembered" by the lagoon. Slight opacity around the exact nature of the ghosts/iterations weakens causality but doesn't break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Lena's discoveries layer into a resonant reconfiguration—the terminal transforms from abandoned ruin to pedestrian bridge. The closure lands with visible cost ("I'm recalibrating") and the sextant's integration drives the transformation. However, the middle section's hydroponics discovery feels slightly convenient, and the foreman scene adds unnecessary coda after the weather vane image provides stronger closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the orrery's assembly and the crystal's fracturing, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the scribe releases his dream rather than abandoning it. Cost is visible in the broken forecourt and his acceptance of being called "ruin" by the elders. The pattern of whispers-to-chimes creates clear before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora drops the ledger (visible cost) and reframes her quest from finding destinations to understanding "spaces between them." The accumulative structure coheres through water/reflection imagery and the sundial's evolving meaning, though the shadow pointing "inward" risks abstraction without fuller dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught knot-reading that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes the garden-tender of time. The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting responsibility for an infinite archive—though the emotional price could be more sharply felt. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by line 2-3.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer—thread, locket, garden—building toward Elias's realization that "the absent who needed their stories told." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when he transforms from obituary writer to "cartographer of the spaces between," with cost visible in the burning thread and his acceptance of carrying absences. However, the prince's backstory remains vague ("He left because the sea promised answers") without concrete dramatization, and some causality feels asserted rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (egg cracking, creature emerging) that reweight the dominant stake of reviving beauty. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when prince and creature hang "not in defeat, but in the quaking reverie of a world learning to breathe again" - cost is visible in the "broken miracle" and acceptance of ugliness. Orientation anchors (prince, palace, egg) established early.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the coin's transformation from father's talisman to healing tool creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the thread darkened with blood). Orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words, and the boy's injury provides the necessary pressure point that forces Liora to enact her philosophy. The cost is legible in "All the best stories do" acknowledging scars as permanent markers, though the final "would she" feels slightly hedged rather than crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern accumulates (breadcrumbs, fractured light, memory threads) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where releasing memories transforms the city's fountains from rust to light. The closure lands with clear cost—"Some things, once unstuck, couldn't be contained"—and Liora's departure signals the irreversibility. Slight opacity around the mechanics of memory liberation prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure: Veyra's choice to sacrifice memory and step into untested light creates Decisive Change with visible cost ("the gear demanded a piece of her memory"). The nebula's cyclic bloom/decay establishes the pattern she breaks, landing with "for the first time, the pattern broke."

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from greenhouse to migration to family dinner, with the hollow-carving revelation serving as the decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost—the carver accepting grief as "a door—one they could open together, again and again." The father's spectral lesson about grief being "the space between" lines reshapes the carver's entire practice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the pendulum's altered cadence making the village "glance at their own wrists, their own ledgers." The cost is legible in Elias's coming exile and the village's forced acknowledgment. The accumulative lens holds as names accumulate weight that literally slows the clock, creating pattern-based closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's understanding that "intentions were just knots waiting to be named," with visible cost in his acceptance of the widow's real request for unraveling rather than burial. The accumulative/textural lens holds as each unknotted thread deepens meaning, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (who/where clarifies around line 3-4).

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Liora's map transforms from potential invasion to accepted "spark" with the spire's song as validation. The cost is legible in her relinquishment of control ("Innovation was never about control") and the physical toll ("fingers numb"). Opening orientation anchors perfectly within first three paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the dust learning to "wait and listen" after Elias vanishes, his message spreading citywide. The seventeen-year story famine establishes clear stakes, and Lira's arrival provides the tightening that forces Elias's choice. Cost is visible in his disappearance and the empty alcove, though the mechanism of his escape remains unexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered artistic philosophy and ritual actions. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Liora's continued practice despite understanding's destructive nature. Cost is visible in the burned portrait and the mask's painful edges. Orientation anchors (gallery, Liora, present action) establish clearly within first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds density through layered archaeological metaphors (sedimentary layers, artifacts, bones) that culminate in Elias becoming part of the silt himself—a Resonant Reconfiguration with unmistakable physical cost. The cog "settling into the silt, ticking" transforms Elias from preserver to preserved witness. The clerk's sanitized record provides ironic counterpoint that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the choir learns to "listen to the cracks" rather than restore what was. The rosette's transformation from artifact to vibrating witness effectively charges the ending. Accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern breaks ("Now, only four remained") that reweight the dominant stake of artistic persistence through hatred's erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from abandoned greenhouse to living community space. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformation with visible cost (giving up traditional chef identity). The seed-to-fruit-to-seed cycle provides coherent causality. Minor deduction for slightly abstract final beats ("gardener of moments").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the city's transformation from routine to wonder carries felt cost in the engineers' coming demands and the irreversible change. The seed-planting causally triggers the drones' chaotic dance, and the riddle's answer ("wonder") effectively reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory detail and recurring motifs (orris root, silence, breathing houses) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora understands that listening, not possessing, creates aliveness. The cost is legible in her leaving the shard behind ("knowing some things weren't meant to be kept, only witnessed"), transforming her relationship to silence from acquisition to participation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with cascading revelations that reweight the central premise—the city as planted rather than drowned, the "god" as child rather than monster. Closure lands with Decisive Change as the human drowns/transforms and the city rises, with visible cost in the lung-filling surrender. The foxglove repurposing from poison to pigment creates resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena's choice to return to the stairs transforms perpetual motion from prison to chosen state. The cost is legible in leaving behind the smooth die and the unopened door to revision. The accumulative lens holds consistently through recursive imagery and pattern breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - the fig tree's new leaf and the painter's acceptance of sleep create visible transformation with felt cost (forty-three nights of exhaustion). The piece teaches its pattern of lost languages and kindness early, paying off when the leaf disappears but the brush shows signs of use, suggesting the kindness was received. Orientation anchors (painter, greenhouse, rooftop) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through lens revelation → bread transformation → shattering choice → communal restoration, with the closure (collective kneading as cultural preservation) carrying visible cost in the shattered lens sacrifice. The "thaw" mechanism coherently links discovery to action, though the beekeeper's absorption revelation arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias stepping "beyond fate's design" into the hunger stones' path, with clear cost ("The sea forgot his name"). The accumulative lens holds as imagery densifies toward the crystallized moment where "keys, once turned, are meant to be left behind" - options and stakes are legible even if the precise outcome remains charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lysander accepts his cursed state, evidenced by his reflection winking rather than flinching. The cost is legible in the "clasp at his throat now held a new kind of hunger" and the implication he's become something other than human. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly within the opening paragraphs, and the closure lands with felt transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Leeward's relationship to the storm transforms from interpretation to collaboration. The sea's answering "voice" creates the decisive turn, and the cost is legible in the uncertainty of "whether the orchard would sink or soar." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (tide prophet, driftwood circle, blue hour).

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elyas joins the watchers and the city remembers "how to move," with visible cost in the whistle crumbling to dust and the gate's scream. The accumulative lens holds as patterns, cracks, and resonances build toward this crystallized moment where "the expedition had never been lost. Only waiting."

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal lens with clear closure: Elias reveals the parallel documents that prove the pattern of lies, fundamentally altering the power dynamic with visible cost (police approaching, career at risk). The "Some things couldn't be buried twice" crystallizes the irreversible change. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed final escape sequence that could use one more beat of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discoveries (note, Keeper's archives, final ledger entry) that reweight Elias's role from surveyor to keeper of stories. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he accepts his role with the Keeper's validation ("You'll know the right cracks by how they ache"). Cost is visible in his isolation and the wife who left. Deduction for slightly diffuse middle section that could tighten the accumulation pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from stamp discovery through coordinate decoding to finding the hidden chamber with Elias's name. The Earned Stasis closure (returning to work while keeping the secret) lands with implicit cost—"Some stillness wasn't meant to be shared"—though the emotional price could be more visceral. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early through layered discoveries and pays it off when the final revelation recontextualizes his entire purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms into dream-stuff, allowing the isle to rise "into the place where dreams are kept." Cost is visceral—"Pain lanced up her arm...peeling back her skin"—and the closure reweights all prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the charged final image of Lena "hunting" in darkness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she crystallizes as "the perturbation" with visible cost (observatory's death, isolation). Deduction for slight ambiguity around whether she actually altered the past or just witnessed it—the "awakening" vs "failure" tension needs sharper resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the constellation reveal and hand-taking, with emotional cost visible in "the dazzling, terrible relief of no longer being alone." However, the chip's function and observatory mechanics remain vague. The accumulative lens holds but lacks full density at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered images (cobalt terrace, driftwood bones, watch hand) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias finds Harkin's note dated tomorrow—crystallizing his complicity and forcing action. Cost is felt through "each step echoing like a name called out too late," though the precise nature of Harkin's disappearance remains deliberately elusive, which slightly weakens causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from stalemate to negotiation to release, with the drawer pull as meaningful lever.

Cost is legible: Lira abandons the ledger logic and unleashes unpredictable consequences under sirens. The closure sits in a charged poise as they flee with a reweighted “we.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the altered lamp hum intensifies the pattern and culminates in a charged recommitment. Orientation is clear early and maintained through a single night-to-dawn arc. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis image—the world can wait, he chooses the dead’s textures—with a felt though subtle price. Causality is soft but coherent for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: fragments accrue toward a charged poise—ledger discovery, the flood, the insertion of the bundle—and reweight the stake of identity. Orientation is clear early and maintained. Closure costs are on-page (shedding the page/name) and the cadence shift with tide lands. A hair shy of exceptional because the ledger’s origin remains intentionally opaque, trimming causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound → memory → chorus → reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early; the dissolving journal is a live constraint that intensifies toward the choice to “decode” by playing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: he foregoes solving for harmonizing, with the shell’s constellations gone and the journal sacrificed. The cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: night painting builds toward dawn surveyors, the clocktower plan, and the charged final image with the chip set in wet paint. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—she commits to “building a third” way, reweighting “foundation” and “time” via mural and sundial. Cost is implied (risk, betrayal of employers) rather than explicitly paid on the page, keeping it shy of exceptional. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene frame holds.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pulses, clicks, dawn edge, and growing drone hum accrue toward a charged final stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he chooses witness over resistance—paid in the acceptance that the crater will be gone. Orientation is immediate; the ticking three-hour window and interval glows give structure and cost. The last image (Earth rising, his shadow) reweights the whole with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causality is clean: detection via water and Lumen → diagnosis → tailored patch → ship’s course corrected → return to shop. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he restores order and reaffirms his role. Cost is implied (effacement, ongoing vigilance) rather than dramatized. Orientation is strong early; scope adheres to a single continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned images (condensation, deltas, drawn rivers) build toward a resonant reconfiguration when the water “unfolds” and names her herald. Orientation is clean early; causal threads (falcon → page → dock → offering) hold. Closure lands on‑page with cost: she relinquishes the map/page and steps into an unmapped role, sealing the ice behind—a before/after with tangible consequence. The motif network coheres the turns without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: the walking-note pattern thickens until a cadence shift (the archway groan, quickened pace) culminates in the child’s laughter. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the town breathes again, but at the price of ongoing vigilance (“he would walk again”). Orientation is crisp from the opening and no causal breaks occur. Stakes stay a hair abstract, but the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the signal’s falter, the vial’s uncorking, and the hush’s gathering escalate density toward a cadence shift when the signal dies. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (refusal to answer + life change), with on‑page cost and a persistent constraint (the hush follows). Orientation is crisp within ~120 words; single POV and two‑shard structure are clean. A slight plausibility wobble (rebreathed half‑full after three days) is absorbed by the established rules of the hush rather than breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: entry, ascent, extraction, imminent pursuit, exit, and a resonant coda. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he can finally tell the truth and not be believed, and the beam’s blue flicker reframes the lighthouse’s meaning. Causality holds under an accumulative lens; the “they are coming” turn tightens pressure. The on‑page cost is implied (risk and the noon bodies) rather than viscerally paid, keeping it just shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated ghost-cameos, bead resonance, and poison economy intensify toward the split‑tree awakening. Closure lands on the page with cost (bead crumbles; Liora unravels), yielding a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (greenhouse, bead, debt), and set‑ups pay off without teleports. The “for now” coda preserves cycle logic without softening the paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the patterned walking/pressing intensifies to the Heart Chamber where the labyrinth reconfigures, and the final repricing (“not a maze; a loom”) lands on the page. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (leaving the cradle, bearing the ache, accepting agency). The causal chain is lyric but coherent: plate→glow→shift→choice. A slightly soft price keeps it just under the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/why), and the causal chain (excavate → find seed → plant → sapling cracks stone) lands a concrete on‑page change. The closure operates as a resonant reconfiguration: a beginning declared via growth and renewed scent. Cost is implied—endurance, solitude, commitment to the dark—rather than explicitly priced, keeping it just shy of extraordinary. The accumulative/textural lens holds steadily through sensory patterning and root-guided progress.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece orients cleanly and tightens toward the act of mailing, with a Charged Poise closure as she relinquishes the name. The cost is subtle yet legible: surrender of authorship and control. Causality is coherent; the chalk request → algorithm → analog safeguard → mailbox flows. Escalation is gentle, limiting peak impact but fitting the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single‑scene cohesion is strong: courier’s warning → synchronization/broadcast → enforcers arrive → dome shatters. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (the observatory’s destruction, embroidery scattered, flame persisting). The hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end and holds without contradictions. Magical mechanics are elliptical but functionally taught early enough to support the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from humming spirits to condensation‑messages to release, landing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the pattern of breath→message→dissolve teaches the closure move. Cost is visible in the forfeiture of direct communication as the letter drifts away. A hair more consequence on the sister side would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions accrete toward a charged poise—final embers and the coral’s transfer—without causal whiplash. Orientation is clear early (atrium at dusk; nurse’s cue), and the scene tightens when the boy arrives, converting vocation into immediate choice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: translating grief becomes material gift; the smudges reweight into speech. Cost is present but soft; one sharper on-page price would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates cleanly from discovery to experiment to communal projection, landing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is early and firm; causality holds (fragment → film → display → momentary bloom → fade). Closure carries cost on the page (the images will “fade by morning”), and the final stance (“promise”) reweights the world. It’s a quiet arc but well‑structured for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: repeats of garden→mural→return densify and reweight the stake until she chooses to cross. Closure lands on-page with cost: “Liora never returned—not really,” a decisive before/after. Causal anchors (nickel + sound as key/bridge) stay consistent, and the blank mural → painting a door → step through sequence coheres. Slight neatness in the late direct address softens pressure but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean accumulative structure: sanctuary → plan → seeding under surveillance → first warning → auditors uproot → “now” signal and step into action. Orientation is crisp early; causal links are consistent and the persistent constraint (Ministry/Auditors/drones) shapes tactics. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing: language routed into roots with social cost already pressing. Cost is felt via active uprooting and risk, if not paid in a decisive confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterning of song, wind, shell, and postcard densifies toward the charged poise of “The Alchemy of Staying.” Closure lands with cost as the shell seals and she rests in vigilance, having committed to louder song and communal weaving. Orientation is clean early (poet in the gargantuan shell by the sea). The final reconfiguration (manual + net + sun + title) reweights prior images without breaking the taught rules.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: repair by flame → awakening of names → environmental rupture → decision to silence by breaking. Closure is a decisive change with legible cost: loss of the preserved wonders and acceptance of mourning. Orientation is immediate (Liora, opal library aloft), single scene, single stake. The final quiet reconfigures options and meaning without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a cadence shift when the ink reveals obligations and the archive “looms” into agency. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the archive is restored/living, foreclosing the council’s intended destruction with conceptual cost (truths now bind). Orientation is crisp and single‑scene coherent; because/therefore linkages hold (ink → obligations → song → loom‑activation → emissaries thwarted). Cost is legible on the page (sacrifice of the indigo and accepting the shard’s ongoing charge).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal drive holds: envelope adhesive → blueprint → interpretation → public confrontation, culminating in a stance with social risk. Orientation is crisp early (amphitheater in a volcano; the chain; why she’s there). Closure lands via a Decisive Change/Charged Poise—she rejects rebuilding the old gates and reframes strength. The price is mostly conceptual/social and the opposition’s rapid nod trims pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid tending Accumulative/Textural: motifs (dust, pigeons, ledgers, meteorite) accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration. Incitement (Luca’s letter/meteorite) → decision (send bird) → vigil → return with “next lesson” delivers closure with felt cost (risking trust, reopening voice). Orientation is crisp from the first lines; a slight convenience in overnight return doesn’t harm coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive (causal clues within a textural build) holds: logbook → terrace grain → note → sinkhole → exchange. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: he renounces control and chooses to join/learn, with cost implied in not “saving” her. No orientation debt; pressure coheres and tightens to a meaningful reconfiguration. A hair shy of 9+ due to slight reliance on intuitive leaps rather than concrete impediments.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the “luminous respite” window organizes beats toward a Charged Poise close where Elara keeps the deep as her locus of belonging. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the ending’s cost is on the page: she does not follow, tucking the feather into the logbook. The tightening arrives at the respite’s peak and releases at sunrise with a reconfigured stance. Quiet, but the before/after (“burial” to “embrace”) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned imagery (seeds, glass, bird, tide hues) densifies to a closure beat where she absorbs the memories, reweighting the premise (the pieces are within her). The on‑page cost is legible and carried into the final image (heavier heart, charged satchel, geode sealing). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what) and the scene maintains one continuous window. A hairline familiarity in “inside her all along” is the only drag on an otherwise tight structure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds to the torch‑gutter synchronization, then resets as the tide turns. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he recommits to playing “the space between the notes,” accepting isolation. Cost is legible (“No one ever did [understand]”) and the environment’s cycle reconfigures cadence at the end. Structure is clean, single scene with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attention to silence/gaps intensifies until the verse completes and reconfigures her status (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). Orientation is crisp early (twilight garden, exile, pond), and the closure lands with conceptual cost (foreclosing the sea’s return; accepting heresy). The beats link through purposeful escalation rather than plotty turns. Cost is legible on the page via renunciation and bodily consequence, not just declared.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: ritual actions accrete toward a Charged Poise ending (first boat appears; he reaches for the next stone). Closure lands with cost as he recommits to a practice the world will “forget,” reframing the day’s beginning. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; causal consistency never wobbles. The persistent constraint is the morning window before the harbor returns, which shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene arc with a clean before/after: he arrives circling grief, ends by contacting Lila and relinquishing the relic. The causal chain is coherent and legible under a hybrid lens with accumulative dominance: reflective density builds to the decisive send-and-leave act. Cost is on the page (letting go of the talisman, risking contact), and the ridge’s two valleys focalize the choice. Orientation is strong from the start; no teleporting props or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: details thicken around gauge/patterns/tide until a conceptual repricing lands (“hope wasn’t a fixed point…”), with the grotto beginning to write back. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene, single POV. Cost is legible in the surrender of tools and the cracked gauge glass. Closure coheres in a charged poise/future‑facing stance as the needle shifts sideways.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the hum → negative → door → mural → re-mapping builds density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as he redefines his craft and passes through an open threshold; the realized cost is emotional reckoning with family memory. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean and early, and there’s one continuous scene. No causality breaks; the door-opening provides a concrete hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the bells and rainbows set a clocked cadence culminating in a charged poise ending. Closure lands with cost—the heartbeat is returned, the soldier’s dream dissolves, and Liora forecloses self-vision. Orientation is clear early (terrace, rain, mirrors, client, payment) and the scene maintains a tight frame. The final image reweights the premise without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational lens: a single pressured negotiation culminates in on‑page signature (Decisive Change) and resolves into an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise where cost is acknowledged (“You’ll break this one too.” “Probably.”). Who/where/when are anchored early; the ritual objects and quoted past treaty cleanly motivate the present turn. The cost is legible in the resigned acceptance of imperfection and the terrace’s charged exhale. Coherence holds without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s burial reframes the drought as legacy and the act as confession, with the storm’s approach tightening cadence. The cost is legible: he forecloses preservation/control for a ritual that erases his measurable leverage. Orientation is clear from the outset; the pattern of returns (salt, cracks, thunder) coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via successive thread releases, vault entry, and echo absorption, culminating in the gates snapping shut and a reweighted final image. Closure lands: she accepts the burden of voices, foreclosing the path of quiet complicity. Cost is legible (“gates sealing shut,” “body humming with…voices,” snow melting at her feet). Minor logic haze about the gates later being “already loosened” slightly blurs mechanics but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a clear RR/CR: a charged poise where Elias reconfigures his practice. Orientation is strong and early; the radar dome/bar frame is clean. The closure lands on the page with a concrete decision and image (“strings loose enough for the audience to see the hands”), with conceptual cost. Causality is quiet but intact: the miner’s rupture prompts the revised tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern intensifies from construction to gust to unraveling, culminating in an earned stasis/charged poise. Closure lands on the page with cost as he accepts transience and begins again (“The migration was over, but the remembering wasn’t”). Orientation is clear from the opening. Persistent constraint (wind/time) shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual action thickens into a sonic/visual crescendo that reweighs preservation as change. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/what). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with legible cost in the dissolution and renunciation. The sequence is tight with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pressure coheres: storm → terminal → film → murals → final dissolution, each intensifying the same stake (interpretation vs. being interpreted). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she relinquishes certainty and the tool (wafer) is spent. Orientation is clear early and the frame holds; one continuous scene with a purposeful cadence shift at the end. A minor reliance on on-screen maxims risks over-directing theme but does not damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat coheres: discovery → decoding → application → descent → altar → reconfiguration on the page. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the closure is a conceptual repricing with a felt cost (relinquishing the tile; accepting a devotional frame). Because/therefore linkages are clean without mechanical over‑explaining. The external regime pressure remains backgrounded, keeping the cost more conceptual than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive with a strong accumulative texture and a causal pivot: the pin’s re‑insertion triggers the sanctuary’s shudder and the return of sound, reconfiguring options (Kael becoming solid). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who/where/what), and the single scene coheres. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they leave the box behind, choosing a new stance with cost. The final image (pin gleaming “like a question they’d finally stopped asking”) lands with undeniable cost and aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterning of fog, mirrors, breathing, and sextant tightens to a resonant reconfiguration at the door/sky crossing. Closure lands on the page with a visible before/after (mirrors to windows; sky as door), though the price is more elegiac than sharp. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). The causal thread is lyrical but coherent: breath → reshaping sextant → mirror recollection → letting go → crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: action builds from dig → box → seed → planting → sprout → ribbon → apple, with each beat reweighting the central question. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing): the contract is renounced while a deeper vow endures, paid for by relinquishing prior posture. Cost is legible in the ribbon bound to the self and the transgressive apple bite. Orientation is clean, and set-ups (satchel, ribbon, light-bend) pay off without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: images and discoveries intensify toward a conceptual repricing (the orchard as library; the cameo as membership), culminating in a stance crystallization. Beats link coherently (note → bathroom inquiry → mirror warning → orchard visions → “Simply/Complicated” → door → recursive return). Closure lands with the catalog entry and pass‑it‑on note, though cost is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clean early and stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coherent causal chain: diary/absences → aisle/door → name spoken → door opens → Library takes → diary blank and memory loss. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the Library “listens,” reweighting silence as the true currency and exacting an on‑page cost. Orientation is firm early, single scene pressure holds. The only slight limit is that the decisive physical act belongs to the traveler, though it’s triggered by Elias’s negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: objects and images accrue (swatch, ledger, mirrors) toward a clear on-page reconfiguration as the sister is restored and they step through the “door.” Causality is legible: the swatch absorbs the erased name, enabling passage. The cost is present (the ship sinking; the choice to remain to help others first). Magical mechanics arrive swiftly but are prefigured enough to hold coherence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: patterned reweavings escalate pressure; the library encounter reframes the central aim; the breath‑ledger image delivers on‑page Conceptual Repricing with cost (foregoing archival control). Orientation is crisp from line one; cause/effect holds (rope → door → library → merge → seal). The closure is clear and felt without over‑explaining. Stakes remain focused and resolve in a decisive stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through density (song-pressure → hush-sphere → fissure → harmonization) to a resonant reconfiguration where the storm becomes a lullaby. Closure (RR) is on-page and legible; Eldrin’s conjuring reweights the conflict into co-creation, with a conceptual cost (choosing vulnerability/dialogue over defense). Orientation is clean and consistent, and the turn from “wall” to “door” is the decisive hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through ritual action until the prism mends and the beacon sings, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (“It had never been about bringing the past back”). Closure carries cost in continued solitude and ongoing labor, with a charged poise toward “tomorrow.” Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it short of the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure densifies via weather, flags, and shadow method until the “offered” memory catalyzes a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the single scene stays tight. Closure lands on the page: she stops “sculpting,” chooses to listen, and the blank page/candles bending presents Earned Stasis with conceptual cost. The cost—foreclosing the archival-certainty path—is legible in “she wouldn’t be the same archivist.”

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to a causal release: fireworks → blooms ignite → stars return. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the mosaic’s command tightens the middle. Closure lands on the page with a decisive world change; the cost is present but light. The chain is coherent, and the final reprise of “Defy the weight” reconfigures the premise without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pause → grotto listening → “shape of it” insight → gifting the cicada → dream/damp sleeve creates a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Closure is on the page via the transfer of the cicada and the charged final image. Orientation is clean and the single transition is purposeful. No causality breaks; the price (relinquishing the talisman) frames the after.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned inversions and the doll‑key escalate toward a decisive, costly rupture: unfolding the bunker and abandoning the father. Closure lands with both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing (“You were never the lock. You were the door.”). Orientation is firm early; no causality breaks. The persistent constraints (inversion windows, hush mechanics) shape tactics through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of silence management intensifies (vial blooms → darkens → hisses → clears) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the charged poise of the final drift with the vial clear, the terrace lighter, and the cost framed as ongoing stewardship rather than erasure. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single scene contains one meaningful tightening (child’s laughter intrusion handled by choice). The cost is subtle but legible in the commitment to teach noise how to move rather than suppress it.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear causal chain: key → hatch → descent → throne → refusal/unmaking, all under a sunrise clock. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the throne dissolved; helix unfurled) and an earned stasis/renunciation. The cost is legible (abandoning claim and identity) though the path is a bit too smooth—few obstacles resist her. Orientation is crisp from the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, signs compound (starlight pooling, stretching shadows, the tremor in the ring) until the shadow’s demand forces a single, decisive action. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: he turns the ring and steps through the new door. Cost is legible (leaving the sanctuary and the bonds he forged by cutting others). Orientation is clear early and consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive lands: causal prompts (texts → turn) fuse with accumulative texture (pressure-to-diamond logic) toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure arrives on the page with cost: the bolt’s conceptual unthreading, the farm’s dimming, and Lina’s renunciation of the loop. Orientation is clean from line one, and the single-scene window holds. The price of walking away—power unanswered, an altered farm—charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern (letters → vibration → mirror → tuning) and lands a Conceptual Repricing: the room is the ledger. Orientation is firm from line one; props and rules are consistent. The cost is conceptual (abandoning logic’s primacy and accepting a humbler stance), felt but restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: density builds via threads/patterns to a charged cadence shift at UNSNAP and the spoken “I was there.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (breaking the seal; pain “like holy fire”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and pays off when the greenhouse reconfigures into a stage. Causal links are legible and motivated within the lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: button discovery → research → identification → decision to mail → renewed commitment via new file. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when established), and the single POV/scene flow holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes his role from passive archivist to active restorer with a felt price. The stakes are scaled to length and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mosaic structure is clean: lagoon → broadcast/diner → years‑later reprise, under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rebel praxis shifts from answering to listening, key left for successors. The decisive action (the fire) is summarized off‑page, softening on‑page cost. Setups (puddles, key, booth) pay off coherently and recur at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the pressure builds via mist, prism responses, and the negative‑sound tactic to a charged poise ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the prophecy collapses but persists within him (the note, the hum between his ribs), binding future options. Causality is legible: he plays to unmake sound; the grotto answers; he “wins” at a price. The train interlude functions as a shard that reinforces the cost and returns us cleanly to the site.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: speck → key → monuments animate → root ladder → climb → transformation → grove. Closure lands with cost: the arbor is gone; her body is altered; responsibility is accepted (“You are the key’s keeper now”). Orientation is clear early and supports the ending’s conceptual repricing of “the hush” as inhale. Each beat grows logically from prior images without soft resets or convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal steps holds: find compass → greenhouse descent → waterfall interrogation → ledger “Improvise” → gear into compass → refusal to wind the clock. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (abandoning control, unmaking identity). Coincidence is reframed into “pattern” within the story’s logic and doesn’t resolve pressure cheaply. The brief “months later” shard still pays forward the stance and cost without undercutting the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details intensify toward a clear reconfiguration—coin → crucible → vial → self‑transmutation. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), with one clean transition to the workshop that preserves momentum. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reweighting of “names/weight” and a visible acceptance of risk (“reduce her to ash”). The causal thread is simple but coherent and sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, single POV, and a crisp accumulative/textural build culminate in a resonant reconfiguration: laughter woven back into the place and role. Orientation is immediate and stable. The closure lands on the page (“Her satchel felt lighter… not because a soul was gone…”), with a felt though subtle price. Causal links are gentle but coherent (pursuit → harp → invitation → chorus).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: waking pain → forest pull → shrine → basin vision → resonance → recalibration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: mercy as absence and echo, accepted at cost on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is promptly anchored, and each beat deepens options rather than resets them. The strap’s snap and the charged reprise at the end seal the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrete (lens → name → log → fitting) to a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean from the opening (market above the city; Lior’s aim) and the pattern is taught early. Closure lands in the final step toward the turning light with a reweighted premise (anchors are for returning) and a felt relinquishment (the painting’s erasure). Cost is soft but legible in renunciation and commitment to the “between.”

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: observation → discovery of seams → opening → revelation of the paused mechanism → choice to dismantle → ghosts released. Closure lands as a decisive act with cost (shattered laugh, end of the show’s engine) and a before/after is legible. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a causal dominance at the end, and the pattern is taught early and held. Setups (dust, barrel, cracks) all pay off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: frost signals negotiability → he prints the destabilizing whisper → library stills → rupture reframes locus as self → dissolution. Closure lands via conceptual repricing with cost (he accepts dissolution and releases the whisper). Orientation is strong from the outset, and the final image aligns with earlier cues. A hair more cause/price linkage between “curator’s warning” and the exact danger of printing could sharpen the cost chain.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens holds: preparation → storm → ritual → refracted reassembly → loss, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (“It isn’t history…It’s poetry.”). Closure is on‑page with cost (the shard becomes dust; the mirrors remain covered; the archaeologists’ stance is reweighted). Orientation is immediate and clean; single scene coherence never wavers. The persistent constraint of the environment (storm/time‑threads) shapes options and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres and culminates in an on‑page conceptual repricing with cost: Elias trades himself for the city’s repriced truth; the chamber peels to dawn; he’s gone. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what). The closure is decisively paid on the page (“It gave him the light. All of it.”). The covenant’s rule set persistently shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmosphere to threshold to renunciation with because/therefore clarity. Orientation is early and stable; the reverse‑waterfall chamber functions as the singular pressure spike. Closure lands on the page with cost (renunciation + burning notes), and the compass’s arc completes. No causality breaks or soft resets undercut the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered images accrete until “the archway wasn’t a door. It was a loom,” prompting a reoriented act that changes options. Closure is on-page with cost: he contributes a hand-carving, loses the slide, and gains a non-digital path home. Orientation is clean from the first lines; magical causality is internally consistent. The decisive reweighting is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrete until the glass reveals living flowers and the premise is reweighted (they open when the world is still enough to hear). Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing with cost (she stops painting, departs, leaves the card). Orientation is clear from the outset. The on-page reveal (“the glass shivered… layers separate like pages”) anchors the turn cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with situational pressure dominant: letters → lagoon → Revision Board confrontation → renunciatory release. Closure lands on the page with cost: he surrenders the diary to the lagoon and redefines his practice (“a new ledger… of what had been released”). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single POV and one clean transition. The because/therefore chain holds without unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative build (senses, crowd-noise, heat) fused to causal action (sustained conception → town manifests). Orientation is immediate: who/where/when are clean by the opening lines. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: wishes redefined as conception, with the cost of relinquishing the talisman and taking up ongoing work. Slight softness in explicit on-page price keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through density and cadence—foghorn silence → emergence of voice → “You are the hinge” → charged renunciation—toward a final charged poise. Closure lands on the page with cost in the refusal to record the prophecy and the choice to bury the shaving where “the roots could decide.” Orientation is crisp from the rooftop garden opening; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: hatch → reopen by decreasing entropy → vortex escalates → planting reverses pull → creature transforms → new cap. Orientation is immediate and single‑scene coherence holds. Closure lands on the page with a decisive transformation and a persistent constraint (“it would return”) that charges the win. The neat replenishment of the “last” cap trims the cost’s sting slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: glue dried → test → detect flaw (aftertone) → rebind with slack → storm hits and the bell “speaks.” Orientation is firm early, and the live clock (zero hour) tightens the window. Closure lands on the page with the bell tolling true and Elias choosing to wait, signaling an earned stasis/charged poise. The cost is mainly risk and responsibility rather than a painful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet care → meteor visitation → lantern/station transfiguration → departure. Closure lands on the page with a Resonant Reconfiguration: repaired lantern, starlit veins, and a reweighted identity (“witness”) with the cost of defying protocol and leaving. Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/when), and the two-shard morning transmission pays off the night’s turn. Cost is present but remains more spiritual than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear, building from ruin to visitation to opening and a reweighted world. Closure lands on the page: the box opens, the covenant untangles, and the final images conceptually reprice silence with felt cost (his enduring muteness and disappearance). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the two-shard coda enhances, not resets. No causality breaks; the pattern it teaches (silence/pressure/light) pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries stack (scratches → messages → capsule → note → twin watch) to reweight the central stake. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: time shifts from line to loom/garage sale, and his role from fixer to weaver. Cost is implied (accepting the labor and risk of “there was work to do,” under dwindling time) rather than dramatized, but legible. Orientation is crisp from the opening and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a dawn‑frame scene accrues motifs (feather, kite, boat, heron) toward a charged repricing—acceptance of incompletion as the living condition of his art. Orientation is clean and continuous. Closure lands on the page via Earned Stasis/CR: he refuses to “stitch” one shimmer, ties a temporary tether, and writes the last lagoon line. The cost is quiet but legible in the renunciations and the tether’s temporariness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is immediate (temple orchard, pillars, Elira’s diary and illness), and the structure holds a clean two‑shard flow (day’s work → night → dawn). Closure lands with visible cost (Elira’s death) and a resonant handoff (Tomas taking up the wire and diary). The accumulative/textural drive coheres; the final image reconfigures stakes without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (spiral, footprints, terminal prompts) escalate toward a decisive choice. Closure is on-page: she touches the galaxy and takes the figure’s hand; conceptual repricing reframes the signal as key and universe as “homesick.” Cost is legible in the “most never come back” warning and the empty lab/dean erasure shard. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density builds from jetty ritual → nocturnal planning → years‑later repricing of the site. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the garden’s persistence and sweeter water reweight the coachman’s quiet labor with a felt cost (anonymity, mortality). Orientation is clean early; the single time jump pays off. The cost is implicit rather than dramatized in-scene, but it’s legible in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the pattern of objects (cylinder/leaf/script) accrues until the dome scene reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on the page with cost as Rook enters and the dome seals—Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing (“first garden war”). Orientation is clean from the opening. Minor quibble: the map‑following is smooth, with little resistance beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies (glimpse → warming compass → needle snap → leap) and culminates in a conceptual repricing where “Home” becomes direction. Orientation is solid early (abandoned observation deck after shutdown) and the closure lands on the page. Cost is legible in the act of stepping off into the anomaly, foreclosing the station-bound life. Setups (sketchbook, compass, shutdown silence) pay off cleanly without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative texture over a clean causal spine) holds: the theft attempt → confrontation → exchange → descent → reweighted sky. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration as the sky begins to mend, keyed to her successful swap and the Keeper’s acceptance. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (the twin lid, the knight/rook switch) pay off cleanly. Cost is present but understated, more conceptual/emotional than materially exacted.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern intensifies toward a clear closure: she answers the lunging penumbra with “release,” reconfiguring the rules—silence trumps story. Cost is legible in the sacrifice of narrative itself and in her step into “luminous absence.” Spatial and temporal anchors are steady; the taught pattern (walk‑spells → board → wings) coheres. The final reassembly of the chessboard with pawns locks the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density compacts toward a decisive reconfiguration (mirror → seed → door → ledger). Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality reads through action more than exposition. Closure lands on the page with cost (“The door behind him sealed shut”), establishing a before/after. The beat sequence tightens without outliney “and then” linking.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density builds (tapestry, labyrinth, thunder) toward a resonant reconfiguration when the village exhales and he elects to stay. Closure lands on the page with cost: he is checkmated and accepts it, the labyrinth empties as crucible complete. Orientation is clear from the outset, and beat‑to‑beat causality is legible. A minor neatness—“it was never a puzzle, only a mirror”—brushes close to statement but doesn’t blunt the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive (causal + accumulative) holds: the chant’s rise → her carving → echo‑amplified lines → ritual falter → spire shatter lands on the page with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the closure is a Decisive Change coupled with Conceptual Repricing. The cost is legible (physical pain, social upheaval, screams), and the final image reweights the premise. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres (acid sea, ticking breaths, keyed scars) and tightens to a clean on‑page closure: key turns, statue lifts, workshop dissolves. Cost is legible in the loss of the workshop and the surrender of the fixer‑self. Causal motifs are honored (three keys with distinct functions; the third transforms the world’s stance). Orientation is immediate and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs tighten toward an earned final act. Closure lands with cost—he forecloses the village life and chooses the cave, with the shell returning in the last image. Orientation is strong from the opening and carries cleanly across the two shards. World rules (mirror/cave) stay coherent enough to support the ending without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern builds from sensing vibrations to scent‑beckoning to Harkin’s recognition, and closure lands as an earned renunciation. The cost is on‑page—he gives up the cork, expends himself, and forecloses the need for proof—reweighted by the lighthouse’s shift from warning to invitation. Orientation is clean from the outset. The single tightening (boats turning, then Harkin’s softening) is sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the patterned calls, lunar modulation, and censer reprises build toward a Charged Poise closure: Lena recommits to her practice with a lighter chest. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when clear). The cost—ongoing grief and endurance—lands in the final image, with the censer “listening” and the fresh sheet feeding forward. Escalation is subtle but coherent, tightening through the live call where she says, “Start walking.”

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Situational→Hybrid lens, pressure coheres (warlord’s men, empathy virus) and culminates in a decisive act: burying the relic. Orientation is crisp early (ravine orchard after storm; satchel with truffles and eye). The cost—foreclosing the cure narrative and living with the risk and silence—lands on the page (“some truths were better buried”). Because/therefore linkages are clean (virus truth constraint → occlusion tactics → untraceable burial).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of absences builds to the ritual and the charged final image. Orientation is clean from the outset (misty dock, lighthouse keeper, time window). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes the keeper role to passing‑on, with the boutonnière’s impending crumble as cost. Causality is soft but coherent; each step naturally leads to the next under the lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (causal pressure + situational clock) holds: chip → ants → fissure → door → fork → renunciation. Closure is a decisive change as he chooses the child’s sob over the maps, with the creek’s surge and the door sealing making the before/after undeniable. The chip going dark reads as a paid-off constraint. All anchors are clear early and transitions are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal throughline is tight: dreams → climb → fissure/memory reveal → surrender → transformation. Orientation is immediate (queen, ridge, forbidden grotto) and maintained. Closure lands on‑page as a decisive change with cost—abdication and bodily pain—plus a conceptual turn (the warning was for “them”). The drive lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from contemplation to rekeying to the decisive “giving back” and the shared jump, yielding a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clear early (Elias at the ember nexus with Liora), the shell’s function sharpens, and the final image reweights the premise with a felt price. The cost is softer than a bodily loss, but the renunciation of his prior practice is on the page (he relinquishes the shell and the capture‑impulse).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: motifs and pressure condense toward the burning and the grave’s reversal. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he relinquishes the chronicler’s compulsion and finds a new stance (“Soared.”). Cost is on‑page (the scroll’s scream; the loss of curated identity) and reshapes options. Orientation is clean early (cabin, grave, two selves) and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details (fog, water clock, screw) build to a cadence shift as fog lifts and the shop’s silence becomes charged. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias accepts absence as a “map” and aligns his work with reading rather than fixing. Orientation is clean early; single scene holds. The cost is present in his ongoing loss and chosen role to witness rather than repair, which forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pressure builds through rune work, the crow’s omens, the wind, and the storm’s “held breath,” culminating in on‑page transformation (scar reweaving, platform descent, rain welcome). Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the scene remains single‑frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible costs (hunger, surrender of the tip, risk of crystallization) and a charged final cadence. The because/therefore chain is lyric rather than causal, yet coherent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via the “current” that threads through archive and orchard, culminating in a charged poise where trees fall yet a new path is chosen. Closure lands with on‑page cost (the orchard is lost; Elias’s physical pain; the emptied bottle) and a reconfigured stance (planting together). Orientation is crisp from the outset; cause/effect stays legible within the magical logic. The final image reweights the premise without soft resets or convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is on-page and costly: tearing the dictionary precipitates the library’s collapse, a threshold, and a repriced world where being the witness is surrendered (“pages were blank,” “for the first time…light”). Orientation is clear early and feeds the ending image. Because/therefore is lyric rather than mechanical, but the chain reads coherent and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate, the causal chain clean: counting engages the machine, anomaly intensifies, the choice to release forecloses intervention, and consequence follows. Closure is a charged Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he refuses the pull, pays in loss, and revalues clocks as choosers, not measurers. The new notch and the “tomorrow, ninety-eight” cadence lock the before/after with cost. Lens: Hybrid leaning Situational at the end with strong causal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via pattern recognition, culminating in her decisive pulse and the charged choice to leave the scanner. Orientation is clean from the outset (domed farm at night, two characters), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a visible cost. Stakes remain intimate rather than externally coercive, but the cadence shift at dawn seals the before/after. No causality breaks or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density and patterning tighten toward a closure that conceptually reprices “contradiction” as seam. Orientation is clean (library, rain, lantern) and the single transition (dissolve/return) is legible. Closure lands on the page: she surrenders selection, steps into the woven light—cost is stepping beyond her father’s rules under the live pressure of his recovery. No causal gaps undermine the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of calls, harmonica notes, and shared losses deepens toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure: he keeps the line open, then chooses to end it and wait again. Orientation is strong from the open: who/where/when are clear, with one scene and stable POV. The cost—persistent loneliness embraced as vocation—lands in the final image (candle, coiled cord, waiting). Slightly modest tightening keeps it below exceptional causality, but closure is clean and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density builds to a cadence shift (whispered words, harbor’s response, bell chime, refusal to look back). Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; cost is the chosen burden of remembrance and the foreclosed backward glance. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: usefulness → rumor → contact → reveal → renunciation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—she relinquishes the rock’s leverage and accepts motion over possession. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the lens holds through the ending image of departure. No causal cheats; each move plausibly flows from the prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of sonic/language motifs tightens into the held breath where the music stops, then reconfigures. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: grief is “mapped,” the ring cools, and the constellations resume—an on‑page before/after. The time window (paused constellations) and the ring’s warming/cooling provide disciplined structure. Cost is legible in relinquishing the hunt for an external endpoint to accept an internal, enduring burden/compass.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the anomaly’s pulse → the unexpected “sigh” → the pre‑written line → the decision to replant. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing): from editing to layering, with an earned action (“Then we plant again”). Orientation is clear from the outset; the single scene coheres. The cost—accepting uncertainty and prior error without revision—is felt in the charged final walk.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned silence-work → apparition → flash/net → harbor’s chromatic answer → reweighted end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Liora’s shaking, the camera “heavier… like a heart full of names,” and its “hungry and patient” charge. Orientation is clean by the opening lines and the lens holds through the final image. The decisive intensification (true flash + harbor’s response) reads earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine: trail → pillar → key → ledger → decision to burn, each step tightening options. Closure lands on the page with cost (he destroys the book/archive) and a conceptual repricing (“saving the world from the promise”). Orientation is crisp from the opening. Minor reliance on declarative sentences for realizations keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: pressure builds through sonic density until the pattern breaks as she “sings” with her hands to release the memories. Closure lands on the page—her mind becomes her own—and the felt cost is implied in psychic exertion and likely institutional backlash. Orientation is clean early: who/where/what are established by ~120 words. The cost is more conceptual than concrete, but it’s legible at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clarity and causality hold: storm scrambles routes → challenger presents shifting map → Lior chooses a quiet traversal → coin fits the non‑door. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a charged invitation and a “finished” map that reframes the labyrinth and his stance. Cost is implied (leaving/transforming his role; forfeiting noise for silence), though not painfully explicit. The hybrid drive leans accumulative/textural and stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the shutter‑weave and mirror reflections thicken into a pattern that reweights the boy’s shame. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—the guardian relinquishes the mirror, and the father’s coda demonstrates concrete consequence. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure coheres. Quiet stakes, but the on‑page cost is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive: accumulative patterning (windows/grotto/chess) with causal turns (warnings → defense → council reversal). Closure lands on the page with the notice and the charged poise of “now they see the board,” and the noon clock provides a concrete test. Costs are implied (risk to children, public escalation) more than dramatized, but the constraints (magnetic hum, aching teeth) are enacted. Orientation is clean from the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: whale call → scrimshaw vibrates → transformation → return of the carving → island’s release, with the “island was a cage” repricing landing on the page. Orientation is immediate (Veyth, docks, fog morning), single POV, one scene. Closure is decisive and resonant, with a visible price (abandoning land/past) articulated in the final third. The mechanism is taught through action rather than exposition, maintaining coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: turbines, hush, bouquet, and tin build to the eruptive scream and the quiet reconfiguration after. Closure lands on the page via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): she screams, then chooses ongoing practice (teaching whittling) with cost in vulnerability. Orientation is clean from the outset. Persistent constraints (post‑Mandate hush, turbines swallowing sound) shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from entry to synch with the hum to the lake answering, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “certainty” and “sacred boundaries.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the pattern taught (hum dissolving edges) pays off at closure. The cost is more conceptual than material, but it’s legible on the page via identity shift and social rupture (elders’ fear, heresy). Structure stays single-scene and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: motifs (plants, crack, reed, phoenix ash) densify toward a resonant reconfiguration where sound and imperfection replace color and fear. Orientation is clean; the scene flows day to evening. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: a quiet before/after where he accepts the cost of imperfection and ongoing debt (two paintings) in exchange for a living connection. Cost is light but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hum’s emergence, deepening into “between,” and the bell’s “unfolding” yield a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) with a controlled two‑shard structure (night → next morning). The cost is subtle but legible—the lens’s disappearance and her choice to leave completion behind. All turns grow from her inquiry rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and choices accrete from the found crane to the box to self‑tattoo to communal dispersal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she opens the curtains and teaches others, with the cost of exposure etched into her skin and practice. Orientation is clean early (observatory, bench, mentor), and set‑ups (stencil, coordinates, flower) pay off. The montage span across days remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds from skylight prisms to tape‑and‑tarot correspondences, culminating in a conceptual repricing: trust measured, rules rewritable. Orientation is clean early (loft, rain, cartomancer, post‑crash). Closure lands in the charged final image of measuring the droplets and a stance crystallization (“reverse engineering the present”), with conceptual cost legible in the acknowledged failures of trust. Causality is soft but coherent for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative build coheres: entering, testing the pagoda, choosing “unmaking,” and accepting dissolution. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost—the pagoda becomes light, the veil fades, the archive seals, and she exits altered. Orientation is clean early and the method taught by the mentor binds tactics to outcome. A small declarative leap (“The civilization had not fallen…”) is justified by the decode moment but trims a hair of on-page inference.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the stone → archival comparison → recognition → offering the shadow. Closure lands on‑page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with cost (“her shadow thin but present”). Orientation is clean and the causal chain is legible without over‑explaining. Minor reliance on summary in the footage section slightly softens immediacy, but doesn’t touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: present‑time care interleaved with concise backstory and a single off‑page errand, all driving toward a charged, quiet reconfiguration. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he steps forward with a chosen ethic; costs are on‑page (medicine relinquished, humility in letters). Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/when). The causal chain is gentle but coherent, with the tail regrowth mirroring his stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring objects (hourglass), plant voices, and the archive build toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the pattern—frozen time, listening—stays consistent. Closure lands on the page with cost as she refuses her habitual reading to carry the wound instead. The hourglass running out and the tower’s “wounds allowed to stay open” provide a clean before/after cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile actions with the reel, crystal, and projector escalate a pattern that reweights the stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): she accepts the goodbye and forecloses the search by letting the dark have its say. Cost is legible on the page in the final refusal and interior shift. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the opening call → descent into the well → unlocking surge → dissolution → reentry. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (archway dissolves; “She had become the path”) and a conceptual price (silence replaces whispers). Orientation is clean early (who/where/why-now), and the structure holds in one continuous scene with a brief aftermath. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: new tracks, green sand, and a chosen vocation, with the cost of responsibility and the threat of reset. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/when via train, dunes, cargo). The clock beat and spark insertion tighten coherently toward the charged final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern is taught early (listen to wind through trees) and escalates to a cadence shift where he reframes the goal from unraveling to becoming. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he relinquishes the gear and the need to “wander,” accepting cost by abandoning a defining habit. Orientation is clean, single POV, one dreamy transition, and the thread holds. The cost is conceptual but felt and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of light, water, and the star stamp densify until the renunciation lands. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she lets the punch go and forecloses the path of ferrying with an on‑page cost (loss of role/tool). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the beat sequence is coherent. The decisive beat is legible: the tool arcs away; she chooses not to retrieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: bolt discovery → trace up the staircase → forbidden door → confrontation → choice to relinquish the bolt. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing of “safety” and an on‑page physical response (the fortress answers, teacup shatters). The cost is legible (guests’ panic, ending of the status quo, risk to Elias). The accumulative/textural pressure is held consistently from first image to last.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal flow: messages → recognition of the rune → required sacrifice → sundered scepter → pretender dislodged. Closure lands on the page with a felt price (speaking Lirien’s name as sacrifice) and a decisive change in world order. The library’s shudder and the scepter’s crack make cost concrete. Lens reads Hybrid with a causal backbone, held through the ending inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with Accumulative dominance: recurring rhythms and fragments accrete until a charged poise at the end. Closure lands on the page with cost: she rejects reporting, the atlas dissolves, water rises, lights die, and she steps onto the submerged road. Orientation is crisp early (station, Voss, gauges), and each beat causally tightens toward revelation without break. The final image reconfigures options and stakes without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single continuous scene holds cleanly: discovery of the hum → contact with the stone → glasses flare → communal ignition. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and sound build to a Charged Poise closure (re‑membering the rebellion) with a tangible external turn (ships light up). Orientation is crisp early, and set‑ups (glasses, stones) pay off. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance holds: kite → decoding → unsealing → communal reweighting. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the community listens; cost appears as social heresy and the elder’s accusation, though consequences soften fast. Orientation is clean early, and the time jumps remain coherent within one locus. The turn lands on the page, but the price is underplayed relative to the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image and sensation build toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure (photo released, leaf pocketed, commitment to prune deadwood). Orientation is clear early, and the on-page cost is legible in relinquishing the photo and bearing the sting to manage overwhelm. The tour group/child’s misrecognition tightens pressure without hijacking agency. The final cadence reconfigures options from memorial stasis to present-tense tending.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pressure of walls closing and the beam guttering tightens toward a Conceptual Repricing where darkness becomes presence. Closure lands on-page with cost—she relinquishes identity and the lighthouse is swallowed. The tarot redesign causally bridges beats to the final image. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: drone → thief sighting → ink pattern confrontation → thief’s disappearance → repricing (“collecting the pieces”) → Kael’s decision to follow. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing, with the cost implied by his earlier transformation and the foreclosed path of vengeance. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the single‑scene window holds. A minor softness is that the price remains mostly conceptual rather than concretely paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: letter arrival → recognition of anomalies → decision to flood networks → alarms → confrontation → death. Closure lands with an on-page, costly decisive change (her death) and a resonant systemic shift (archives “speak back”). Constraints (regulations, surveillance, purge cycle) hold the lens and shape tactics. No orientation debt; the final image reweights the story’s rule-set with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear orientation and a coherent accumulative/textural lens culminate in Earned Stasis: she chooses to remain and tend, with the fissure and outside ruin as persistent constraints. Cost is legible in the refusal to flee and the plan to stitch the dome—“By dawn, the desert would be ash… and Liora would be there.” The one-scene structure tightens around the crack and wind rattle, then resolves to a charged poise. Slight softness in causal turns is appropriate to the lens and doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats escalate coherently: restless garden → false name → mouth in the earth → command of silence → costed release. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he restores pattern and chooses the lasting silence over the seductive echo, with visible price (blackened stems, “daughter’s voice finally stopped calling”). Orientation is crisp from the outset; no lens ambiguity at the end. The net, rail spike, and stars reprise to bind causality without explaining away mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: the journalist’s call → ledger check → damning entry → arrival of plates → decision to publish. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (implicating her father’s legacy). The plates’ convenient timing feels coincidental and partially resolves pressure externally, muting the earned grind. Orientation is crisp and scene unity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture supported by clean causal links: letters → method attempt → false hush → backlash → time fold → paid witness. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she refuses erasure and commits to witness while cost (enduring the cry) is felt on the page. Orientation is swift and consistent; no lens ambiguity at the end. The final reweighting (wings “singing”) proves a before/after with a conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whisper→mandala→void→chorus→public mural→return to grotto, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing (“Always,” drawing the void again). Orientation is clear early and the throughline reads clean. Closure lands with a reweighted premise (remembering over unlearning) and a felt social cost implied by defying elders, though the price remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. No causality slips or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative build: the ritual intensifies until the commander arrives, escalates to lethal threat, and resolves via a resonant reconfiguration as the sword drops. Closure lands on the page with cost (risk of death, surrender of violence), and the final image reweights the plaza’s meaning. Orientation is clean from the first lines. Slight softness in explicit costs (no immediate loss beyond risk) keeps it shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the orchard’s rules and the coin’s echoes accrete into a cadence shift when Elias stands and chooses life. Closure is on-page and costly: Lydia fades, the boy forgets, the coin will cycle back. The single-scene structure is tight with clear anchors early and one meaningful deepening (visions of possible futures) leading to the decisive act. No causality gaps; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and causal turns holds: sliver → somatic sequence → walls breathe → choice → door → crossing. Orientation is clean within the first lines; stakes and tactics tighten when she opts to paint a way back rather than immediately vanish. Closure lands as a decisive crossing charged by prior set-ups and a clear price (absorption of the sliver, departure). The cause/therefore chain is intact without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density builds to a resonant reconfiguration where Lior speaks and the cave answers. Orientation is swift and clean; the single scene coheres. Closure lands conceptually (Lior assumes the role of cartographer‑voice), though the on‑page cost is subtle rather than dramatized, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear Causal lens: jar’s clue → perilous retrieval → threading the ninth button → hourglass reverses. Closure lands on the page with a charged reconfiguration; the conceptual cost (“The hourglass doesn’t break. We do.”) is legible and reweights prior stakes. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; scope is tight to one mission. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene structure, clear anchors, and a clean Situational lens: external prompt + ally pressure forces a stance crystallization. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost: she opens the box, accepts the key/coordinates, discards the pillbox, and commits to “finish it.” Setups (message in snow, pillbox) pay off without contrivance. The causal chain is lean and coherent, with no soft reset at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with causal rule inside a textural build: the parchment’s condition (“fog lifts twice before the gutters fall silent”) governs the decisive “Now.” Orientation is immediate (fog, river crossing, coachman waiting), and the two lifts tighten to a clean on‑page turn. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration as the needle passes hands, with the cost of duty/endurance present though understated. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but the on‑page clock (gutters falling silent mid‑crossing) gives it bite.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the thrum, glass, kiln, and bee images densify toward a final conceptual repricing (“resistance wasn’t refusal. It was remembrance.”). Orientation is clean, and the closure image is on-page with a visible (if gentle) price in relinquishing the bowl. Escalation is quiet but coherent; a hair more concrete consequence would lift cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via basil wilting, the nick, Elias’s arrival, and the charged exchange of tools. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “two keys to a lock neither of them needed anymore.” Cost is legible—risking hope and intimacy after trauma, marked by the blood offering. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the scene maintains one cohesive window.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural holds: hum peaks → bird strikes reflection → shockwave → mirror‑book translation → feather offering → doors open → exit. Closure is on‑page with cost: a conceptual repricing that forecloses the path of penance. Orientation is clean from the start, and the sequence maintains because/therefore coherence within the lyric pattern. The clock via the sundial and hum provides a tight structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: present‑tense choices accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end (secrets as rejoining rather than hoarding). Orientation is clear, scene-to-shard cohesion is strong, and the dream image reconfigures the premise without breaking logic. Cost (relinquishing private drafts) is legible, if subtle. No causality slips; one meaningful tightening occurs with the second spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: signal shifts → Liora infers provocation → she transmits → campus mood alters → the signal “laughs” → she refines → the pattern reconfigures. Orientation is anchored quickly, and the story holds a Hybrid leaning Causal lens to closure. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the alien stance moves from predatory to curious, reweighting the campus fractures. The cost is present but understated, mostly conceptual and bodily rather than materially escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant causal drive holds: need → compass to slab → vault opens → chamber mutiny → test → decisive act. Closure lands on the page when he drives the key into the table and the city blueprint “breathes,” a clear Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible though modest (risk of impalement by compass and the crush of claustrophobia). Orientation is clean early; the pattern taught (organ, mutiny) pays off at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: the ribbon prompts the descent; the lance ritual deepens into the echo; knowledge changes and reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot reopen the case but transforms the purpose from justice to witness, paying a conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the ritual’s logic teaches itself through action. A minor softness is that the lance’s rules are implied rather than tested, but they don’t destabilize causality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: storm unearths box → journal/nail deciphered → Maw moves → he tests nail → rupture and snapback → renunciation by fire. Closure is Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses pursuit and reframes courage/door with a felt cost (shattered window, lost evidence). Orientation lands early (who/where/when are clean). The lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal and holds through ending.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is swift (pullout, hitchhiker’s vanishing, Elias with fiddle) and the pattern (keys/hitchhikers/left objects) is taught early, then paid off in the door‑opening cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: he steps through; the glass dissolves; identity redefined as “He was the song now,” with a visible forfeiture. Causality is associative but coherent: observation → glass vision → play → threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate, and the piece tightens through object discoveries and refrains toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Cost is the foreclosing of forward‑momentum identity (he “doesn’t wonder what comes next”), reweighted by the settling train. The causal thread is quiet but coherent, with the ending’s image paying the accrued pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations and images intensify toward a reweighting of the premise (temple as loom; burden shared). Closure lands with visible cost: relinquishing the ledger and the telegram crumbling, with a new stance crystallized. Orientation is clear early (observatory, ledger, telegram, sister); the magical escalation (stars answering) is consistent within the taught rules. One scene, one dominant stake, and a decisive cadence shift are cleanly delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: seed planted → plant summons/forces confession → truth revealed → key retrieved → renunciation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts the cost of knowing and refuses further action for now, pocketing the key. Orientation is tight from the opening and the lens holds. The only hairline slip is the warlock backstory arriving as a brief explanatory patch, but it feeds the current tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: image density builds (glade → maze → dais → bridge → future‑self) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration—“The covenant was never broken” reframes the quest with cost encoded in scars. Orientation is clear by ~120 words and the single‑scene flow with one transition (maze heart) holds. Closure lands on‑page via the silver leaf and keeper naming; the cost is felt but not crushing. Minor quibble: the “you’re early” complication doesn’t materially alter tactics beyond a sprint, softening the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres from setup through a tightening middle (the voice and the roots’ pull) to a charged final image (white flower, wilting; acceptance). Closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/RR: she trades the hidden name/guilt and reconfigures her stance toward her scars with cost legible in the flower’s wilt. Orientation is crisp early; world rules (offer/give in kind) stay consistent and drive the outcome. The last “Somewhere” beat broadens scope without undermining the central closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via pattern (quarry blasts/“after”/dust→lighters) to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The decisive change lands on the page—he claims the cloth and reframes worth: “He didn’t know what the cloth was worth, but he knew it was his.” Cost is legible: he forecloses the safety of valuation-as-worth and accepts uncertainty. Orientation is clean from the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the density and cadence tighten from study → climb → planting → reversal/tilt → reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: reestablishing love while accepting loss; the decision to return “not to stay, but to understand” forecloses a path. Orientation is clear and consistent, and the Arbor’s rules hold. The causal throughline (translate → seed → flowering → passage) is clean enough to support the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through pattern and cadence—arrival of the woman, the lunar flip, the crucible choice—toward a charged poise. Closure lands via conceptual repricing and a small physical act (spoon with “tomorrow’s first second”) with the cost implied in renunciation (ledger refusal) and the ongoing burden of the creel. Orientation is clean early and the pattern taught is kept. The cost could be a hair more explicit, but it’s felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: shells → confessions → pearl → crowning → dissolution of walls, with a clean on‑page reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (bunker → caves) and the throughline is continuous. Closure lands with cost: she absorbs confessions, forfeits the pearl, and defies the higher‑ups. The radio beat subtly tightens external stakes without derailing the lyrical structure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean single-POV progression from station to bridge to choice; orientation is established early. Accumulative/textural drive coheres, culminating in a Charged Poise: “Not forgiveness… But a beginning,” crystallized by turning right. Cost is legible (accepting “sorry,” risking self-indictment, walking off-map). Escalation is quiet, but motivic linkages (graffiti → bridge → right/left) keep because/therefore intact.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive (situational pressure + causal tool) is consistent: the watch’s reverse ticks create glimpses; the second letter’s posting collapses options. Closure lands: she renounces dependence on the watch/library and commits to saying the unsaid—visible costs include the library’s loss and leaving the watch. The two-shard structure (library → desk) is clean, with the chime as hinge. Minor softness: the “document them before dissolution” goal yields to a new aim, but the repricing makes it cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene, situational pressure coheres: auction at dawn/men at midnight, because/therefore choices culminate in smashing the violin. Closure is an on‑page decisive change with cost and persistent consequence (garden transformed; she’s reported). Orientation is clean and early; the drive lens holds through to the charged, singing‑garden ending. No stray setups remain unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern‑reading builds to the doorway apparition and the received message, a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first line (who, where, what she wants). Cost is on the page—the chip goes dull, and the moment vanishes—marking a before/after in her stance toward death. The sequence of focus → doorway → message → spent key holds causally even in a lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the grotto encounter layers toward a charged transformation, then resolves through the silent offering to the arsonist. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (forfeited heirloom, bodily integration of the shoot), and the single escalation is sufficient for the length. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard movement (grotto → village/evening) is coherent. No causality breaks; the spiral vision reweights the premise credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: shard → chimes → cloak → dawn → revised beam culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure that reconfigures his role. Cost is legible on the page (he stops polishing, lets the beam waver, risks purpose/ships). Orientation is clear early and the design teaches its lyric pattern cleanly. Minor direct statements risk over-explaining the final repricing but do not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripples, field hum, age regression intensify to a charged reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands with felt cost (gasping, stuttered reversal to sixty‑two) and a crystallized stance (“The rings would teach the rest”) as he descends. Orientation is clear early and remains stable. The causal weave is lyric rather than plot‑driven, but the pattern break in the water functions as the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: anomaly → Maw inferred → binding the pulse to stone → charged poise as the Maw passes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with conceptual cost (movement as confession; he forecloses motion to survive and restore harmony). Orientation is crisp; the price is present though subtle rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid but dominant Accumulative/Textural drive: the density of “lingering luminance” images builds to a CR/Earned Stasis ending where he leaves the keystone and walks out. Orientation is immediate; the arc (climb → garden shift → return and renunciation) is coherent and causally legible. The cost is on-page (rejecting acclaim and institutional mastery) and charges the final image against the automated hymn. A hair shy of 9+ only because danger and constraint briefly soften (mist-walking deflates the climb’s pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural is held: ritual → wreck → key → door → frozen festival → decisive lantern release → repriced return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he carries a vow and a transformed sensorium. Causality is coherent within the taught rules (the key opens the liminal door); no orientation debt. The price is quiet but legible in the charged final image and foreclosed naïveté.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static → coin alignment → harmonic → dissolution → reconfigured dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: “pulled her apart, atom by atom” before the universe resets to charged poise. Orientation is clean from the first line, and set‑ups (backwards hum, coins as keys/mirrors) pay off causally in the ending image (“the light moved”). The cost is legible on the page and informs the final state.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: wax‑recording cues → dusk light mechanism → crystallization → naming → release yields a coherent pattern deepening toward a charged final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he unleashes named monsters and accepts the cost by continuing his road, with the first scream confirming consequences. Orientation is clean early (observatory, recordings, dusk). The causal spine is slender but purposeful, with no late rule cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: study → tuning spell → bell’s weep → synchronized drips → bay’s churn → partial restoration with declared limits. Orientation is immediate (viaduct at dawn, End of Tides) and held in one scene with one stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: balance not fixed, but options reweighted; price paid in stamina and the commitment to “the real work.” The constraint of limited magic and a fractured bell holds the lens to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: images and actions accrete toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias relinquishes silence and role rigidity. Closure lands on the page with cost (burning the photos, letting the bottle sink) and a clear before/after stance. Orientation is clean and consistent, with one continuous scene and a decisive cadence shift at the burn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery densifies until the blue flame/door appears and the orchard reconfigures. Closure is an on‑page decisive change (door entered) with conceptual repricing (logic and intuition never separate) and felt cost (world left behind). Orientation is clean early; causality (flame → crystal sings → transformation) coheres without teleports. The price is legible at the ending beat (foreclosed old world), satisfying the cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres from prep → jump → descent → landing, with a final Charged Poise/Earned Stasis in refusing contact. Closure cost lands (chosen isolation; uncredited salvation) and the lens holds. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (buckle, radio, wind) pay off. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the form and length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: the looming hearing and propaganda rewrite force immediate action; Veyra’s delivery of the “Original” narrows options; Kael’s blood-ritual triggers the merge; history’s rewrite halts as consequence. Closure lands on-page with cost (jars emptied, pain, collapse) and a reconfigured world image. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words. The ritual’s mechanics are brief but seeded enough (“vivify… through complementary opposites”) to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the seed’s arrival, display, sprout, planting, business slowdown, and bloom build a pattern that culminates in a charged final image. Orientation is clean from the outset; time elisions are purposeful and legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (foregone business, unsettling bloom embraced). Causal links are coherent even as the design privileges cadence over reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sound patterns and ritual build to a pattern break (blower cough → household laughter) that reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant renunciation with cost (leaving the blower “pointing like an accusation,” choosing to listen/go up). Orientation is clear early and maintained. The coincidence of the child’s joke slightly weakens causal linkage, but the closure still lands under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of image and pressure crescendo from mist and pendant to the librarian’s offer and the garden’s unraveling. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost; “Now, we read each other” reweights guardianship into surrender. The price is on‑page: she gives up her role and self‑containment to thirsty light. Orientation is clean early, and the causal thread (pendant → figure → surrender → unmaking) is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Causal, held cleanly—each step (crozier hunger → offerings → incantation → explosion → redefinition of “vivify”) flows via because/therefore. Closure lands with a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: the crozier remade, guild flees, Elias commits to heretical praxis with social cost. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the two‑shard feel (before/after the bloom) remains one continuous window. Cost is legible on the page: he chooses a path that makes him anathema to the guild.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image and cadence intensify through dish activation → shatter → internalization → city‑wide resonance → leap. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a charged act (jump) and visible cost (dish destroyed; surrender of tool/assumption). Orientation is crisp by line ~1 (who/where/when), and the ending reconfigures the premise without explanatory backfill. The gorge and gravity reversal render the before/after legible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with coherent causal threads: the collapsing route (radio’s five-minute clock) forces Lira to merge timelines via the hourglass and pattern alignment. Closure lands on-page with the starlight “snap,” stabilized sky, ghosts solidifying, and the hourglass now full with rising “sand.” Cost is more conceptual than visceral but seeded (“years feeding it moments”) and paid by foreclosing paths as the grotto seals. Single continuous scene maintains orientation and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene structure holds cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens: weave → eruption → resolution to a charged poise (“Again?”). Causality is legible and the closure reweights ownership of memory with a conceptual cost. The dismantling threat is more mood than forcing function, so pressure is gentler than it could be. Still, the snapped thread and emptied frame mark a before/after with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—“some things weren’t meant to hold you down.” Orientation is clear from the outset, and the piece coheres as two shards with a single throughline of tactic (edges/light). Closure lands as a charged poise toward change with a clean final image. The cost is largely conceptual (abandoning old charts) rather than dramatized on the page, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative finish: the hearing aid’s pulse → bench → glove → apparition forms a coherent chain, while the mist and echoes build pressure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he reframes his vocation to include the dead and is “led” rather than chasing. The “bring her back to the photograph” instruction pays off in the final exchange. The cost is slightly soft on the page, relying on implication more than explicit consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-POV, two-shard passage through a taught pattern (phase seam), with a clean accumulative build to a charged final image. Orientation is solid early; the tide-clock and sealing seam provide the tightening. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he exits altered with a charged object/image (blue-lit drop), and a credible price hangs (risk of being kept). Cost is more implied than explicit, keeping it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: the radio clears, the ink instructs, the archives wake, and the heartbeat reweights meaning. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis—she chooses to count with, not down—while the death certificate remains as persistent constraint. Orientation is crisp from the opening. Cost is emotional but legible in the renunciation of fear-as-control.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with a causal dominant: diamond + birds → harnessing → unintended awakening → entrapment/death. Orientation is crisp early, and the set-ups (curse, bone towers, flock-script) all pay off. Closure lands on page with cost: “The diamond cracked… the storyteller does not.” The conceptual flip (curse for answering) reweights prior beats without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via recurring images (arrowhead/phone/static/garden) to a decisive metamorphosis. Closure lands with cost—Elias forecloses human life to join the “harmony untamed.” Setups (arrowhead, phone, garden’s memory) pay off cleanly and causally. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the final image reweights the premise without handwaving.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the music + shell signal densify until the crack, bloom, and melting statues deliver an on‑page reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset (sky‑bridge, orchard, statues), and beats link coherently. Closure lands with a felt, if gentler, cost—exertion, surrender of safety, and the world’s rules repriced. Recurrences (shell, bridge, statues) pay off causally at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: patterning of borders/letters/storm accrues until the post‑office delivery reweights meaning (CR/RR). Causality is clean: package → alley test → bottle opened (knowledge deepening) → drones tighten → decision to the haunted office → delivery. Cost is legible (risk, time pressure, renunciation of safety; ongoing duty), and the final image crystallizes a before/after stance. Orientation is anchored early and remains coherent through the two‑shard structure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through pattern-dense images (fragment → song → mirrors → offering) to a resonant reconfiguration: silence is repriced as offering, not absence, with an Earned Stasis ending. Cost is legible in his refusal to speak and in accepting never-finished work. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from quiet observation to ritual to the morning reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—he surrenders the talisman and opens access. Orientation is clean (who/where/when solid by the first paragraph), and the night-to-morning two-shard structure is coherent. The price is legible on the page (the scarf dissolves; he abandons gatekeeping).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural: the sunrise clock, failed attempt, then partial success tighten pressure toward a final stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she binds the dream and accepts the cost (the footstep smear, the library’s hum of swallowed dreams). Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp by the opening lines; props and rules recur coherently. The causal thread (attempts → apparition → plea → refusal) is clean and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with on‑page Conceptual Repricing: the hair becomes a map/question, reweighting the stake from opening a prison to liberating agency. Orientation is clean early; the star’s hint and shop’s dissolution teach the pattern the story pays off. Cost is legible at the end (she refuses the client’s demand and accepts uncertainty and consequence). The closure image coheres and holds the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive (causal steps within a lyric frame) holds: mushroom residue → pedestal → hum → realization of trading → invocation → sky stitches → confrontation. Closure lands on the page with cost: “the weight of his own life” returns as the fairy ring crumbles (DC + RR), and options are reconfigured. Orientation is crisp early; props and rules set are paid off. No late rule change undermines the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via charged objects (cup, glass, shadow) and culminates in a Charged Poise—shadow re‑sealed, map glowing, and the line about waiting for the next knock. Orientation is immediate and clean; tactics arise from established rules (angles, tea‑geometry). Closure lands with conceptual cost implied rather than fully paid, but the earned stasis—hold and wait—reconfigures the situation. The single scene is coherent, with a tidy because/therefore chain within an accumulative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single-POV progression with one purposeful transition through the veil and back; orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern intensifies toward a charged poise: debt named, miracle reframed, and a consequential departure. Cost is on-page in “kindness with teeth,” the relinquished seed, and leaving the village. No major causality gaps or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative lyric build to a decisive act: letting the needle drop/last knot unravel triggers the release. Closure lands on the page with cost—the sanctuary shatters, his vocation is relinquished, the town’s order reconfigures—and the final image (“felt like a door”) recodes the premise. Orientation is clear from the opening; causality holds through to the tide’s turn. The price is legible in the broken prisms and social aftermath implied.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is held: pattern recognition (films, seasons, silence) builds to a conceptual repricing—space→time threshold—with a charged refusal. Orientation is clean from line one; the vault, tools, and objective are clear. Cost is present but subtle (she chooses not to step through and accepts returning without proof). The sequence of discoveries is legible and coherently escalates toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, closing in Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean early (sunken library, Electra, globe), and the escalation (snow inverting, beam pulsing) reweights the premise toward thresholds. Closure lands with cost on the page: she withholds the discovery and embraces “Some transmissions weren’t meant to be answered,” with the lie settling as “sediment.” Coherence holds across the two shards (below/above) with one purposeful transition.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: encoding summons response; revelation of the ghost’s true need narrows options; the decisive act (slamming the bolt plate) produces an on‑page change with cost. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the drive lens holds to closure. The cost is legible in the image of his raw silence and the world’s wiped graffiti. Tight and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: elevator floors, data patterns, light motifs accrue toward “Look up.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a clear on-page price (“cold… the price of seeing clearly”) and a forward action (climb). Orientation is clean and the single-scene ascent tightens coherently. Minor softness: the cipher’s mechanics remain atmospheric rather than problem-solving, but the linkage to the ending is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure densifies from drift to vision to surrender, culminating in a reweighted rule (“the sky is the remembering”) and the string’s light‑restoration. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (gondola, snapped string, city below). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with legible cost (giving up separateness, unread ledgers). The cause chain is lyrical rather than mechanical but coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin → instruction → overnight craft → dawn refracting sky → collapse → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing, with the lost library and erased coin indentations as on‑page cost. Orientation is clean early (artist, oak library, demolition clock), and setups pay off (coin returns warped; “mirror the sky” reframed by the final blank portrait). Tight causality for a lyric piece; no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: discovery → hypothesis → test (tracing) → communal action (jump sequence) → release. Closure lands on‑page with the ship snapping into alignment and engines roaring, but the cost is minimal and the phrasebook’s perfect timing carries a hint of convenient alignment. Orientation is clean and the single scene window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: methodical repair leads to humming mirror, child revelation, retrieval of the watch, and the door opening. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the scene holds to one window and pays off its set‑ups. Closure lands with a Decisive Change plus resonant reconfiguration (she “feels like the key”). Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized in the moment, trimming the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres cleanly from first bell to final vow, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration: the nebula reframed as a communal state, sealed by “We stay.” Orientation is crisp early, and set‑ups (arches, bell, chalk, cracks) pay off without contrivance. The cost—renouncing drift to commit to Veyth—registers conceptually and emotionally on the page. Quiet escalation through ritual and work avoids and‑then sequencing and lands the closure image with integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmospheric prelude to a single decisive insertion of the “key,” delivering a resonant reconfiguration: the clock’s purpose reframed from countdown to holding the hush. Orientation is clean from the outset and the linkages (vouchsafe → realization → act → non‑strike) track. Cost is on the page (the end of Elias’s function and thread) and charges the final image. The causal spine is simple but coherent and sufficient for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she uses the last nut, fixes nothing yet, and recommits to guiding as frost locks the birds. Orientation is clean and the because/therefore of routes, frost, and birds coheres. Cost is legible on the page (resource depletion, ongoing burden). The blueprint reframes the maze’s intent, lending a subtle conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: river patterns accrue until the decisive placing of the chrysalis and the final wade to convergence. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure lands with cost (letting go of the fetishized object and his atonement model). The lens is taught through motifs and paid off by the confluence image. No causality breaks; the single scene coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the patron’s request → the listening/incision → the seam → trade → renunciation, culminating in a charged poise. Closure lands via a conceptual price: keeping the bottled moonlight unopened and recommitting to her role. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and no causality breaks appear. The before/after is legible: once in lull, after charged poise with stakes reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds via sensory density and ritual cadence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: he gives the soldier’s remorse to the pavilion and exits “clean.” Cost is legible as ongoing risk of contamination and the toll of stewardship, with a final recommitment. Orientation is crisp early (chef, fortress after rain, pavilion under dunes), and causality reads cleanly as ritual sequence. The closure lands quietly but definitively.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal flow: theft/re‑framing of the weight → confrontation → shared plan → tangible next‑day change and public reprise. Orientation is firm from the opening sentence and holds through two concise shards. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town moves from babel to “beginning of a conversation,” with concrete proof (ledger, whistle exchange), though the cost remains primarily conceptual/ongoing. The inferred lens is Causal, and it holds through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a steady deepening from canyon/mirror setup to entanglement realization. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to “unfold” and leaves as “cartographer of the entangled dark,” with the mirror in hand. Cost is conceptual but legible—identity and psychic burden embraced. Orientation is clear and single‑scene scope is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine (manuscript → grotto → threshold → chamber → collapse) and an accumulative, charged finale (seed as new option with cost). Orientation is clear early; the hour‑long inversion coherently pressures events, and the collapse forecloses access. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: manuscript spent, chamber gone, one seed gained; options reweighted. The smudge‑to‑seed beat is swift but causally primed by the brother’s thumbprint and the manuscript’s prior magic.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of vibration imagery deepens until the grove “answers,” reweighting silence as waiting. Closure lands via a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—he leaves the insulator, the grove keeps the song, the birds carry it forward—making a legible before/after. Causality is coherent, taught by tool use and method; no teleporting props. The cost is felt (forfeiture, bodily drain, acceptance that the song is not “his”).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the nexus’s hum and pulses aggregate pressure toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at “Your turn.” Orientation is clean early—who, where, when are legible—and the single scene tightens coherently. Closure lands on the page through the transfer of the worry stone and the reweighted understanding of the covenant as “waiting to be heard.” Cost is felt as vulnerability and the surrender of a talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fireworks pressure + device hum + diary’s last entry tighten toward a charged decision. Closure lands with cost via Decisive Change into next morning’s action (“Silence repaired here”). Causality is coherent—because fireworks threaten to drown meaning, he acts now; because the device reacts to his silence, he reframes his ethic. A hair shy of 9+ only because the guild‑ruins visit is elided and the cost is primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: theft → planting → bloom → Elders/visions → repricing (mirror) → communal shift (bridge, unlocked vault). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a visible social risk and a reweighted final image. Orientation is clean early; the world’s rules are learned through action without dumps. The cost is felt but not severe, which trims peak impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; Closure: Conceptual Repricing with a Charged Poise—she reframes the echoes as instructions and commits to planting the sapling at the core. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the inversion clock structures the scene. Causal seams hold, though the path to the seed is relatively unopposed, softening felt cost. The mentor relic’s dissolution and bodily alteration mark a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern recognition lead to a conceptual repricing (“the city had learned”) with on‑page cost (shattered instrument, lost patch, limp). Orientation is clean and the single-scene window coheres. The flare’s brief efficacy is a decisive cadence shift that reweights options. Closure lands as a charged poise with a tangible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chime deepens the pattern and reweights stakes, culminating in the aurora “staying.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (defiance, destruction of the amber sheet, a village reconfigured). Orientation is precise from the start; cause-effect within the lyric frame is consistent. The on-page cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Beats link cleanly: note as “question” → shadow/marker response → child’s lure → choice to widen, not seal → crossing and leaving the flute. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: he relinquishes guarding to enter the weave, leaving tools and identity behind. Orientation is clear early; the hush and objects persist to shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive lands: patterned intensifications (press → face in ink → flood of others’ feelings → sky’s proof) culminate in a conceptual repricing (“You were never the printer. You were the page.”). Orientation is clean early; the magical turns pay off established rules. Closure carries felt cost (identity surrender) and a legible before/after in how he engages the press and the sky. The mechanism’s autonomous printing and the final choice to give rather than capture secure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure thickens via hum frequency, aurora unspooling, and seed-to-bridge reweighting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: he accepts “carry the hum,” plants the seed, and reframes absence as extension with on‑page cost (relinquishing the pendant/identity). Orientation is clean early (ridgeway, pendant, abyss, mentor), and the sequence coheres. Minor hand‑wavey cosmology doesn’t harm causality under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the density of signs (frost patterns, prism heat, face in ice) tightens into a decisive act. Closure lands cleanly: he throws the prism; frost melts; the final image reweights his quest with cost. Because/therefore linkages are intact under the lyric pressure (listening → revelation → answering prism → renunciation). Stakes and cost are legible on the page without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: find bead → transform silence into thread → dissolve tapestry → receive reply seed. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (“the sender must stay” followed by decades passing). Mosaic shards (orchard, traveler, city) are legible and cohere under the single stake. No orientation debt; the closing image reconfigures options and locks the price.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative lyric pressure) holds: descent → barter → planetary settling → community response. Closure lands with cost: “The silk was gone now,” and the world reconfigures into Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (rebuilding under a new hum). Orientation is clear early (orchards, twin suns, mine shafts), and the throughline remains tight. The single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative dominant: patterned images (shard/seam/static) build to a reconfiguration where attention becomes the tactic. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: “She was the map now,” with a tangible step through the seam. Cost is implied (abandoning the chase for surrender/trust) and could be sharper on-page. Orientation is crisp early and the scene holds to one pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: recurring bottles, stones, and glass reweight the central stake until “Stay” crystallizes choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he refuses departure, commits to the tower, with the visible price named on‑page (“The skiff would rot at the dock”). Orientation is clear from the start and the pattern taught early pays off at the ending image. No causality breaks; each step coheres as a motivated intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure builds through ritual intensification (light narrowed, shadows answering, wick burning down) to an Earned Stasis—she holds until false dawn. Orientation is clean early (emerald lighthouse, night, village below). The closure lands with cost signaled (depleted wick, endurance, ongoing bargain) without a decisive turn, but the cadence shift at dawn reads as a meaningful tightening. A concrete test beyond a fraying silhouette would sharpen the felt stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: light, wing, and heart accrue into a reconfiguration where he internalizes the sun trails. Closure lands on the page with cost (the wing dissolves; he foregoes owning stories) and a charged final image (quiet tea house as invitation). The mysterious visitor is a slight coincidence but functions as pressure rather than a resolution. Orientation and through‑line remain clean within the two‑shard travel frame.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the sextant’s dismantling thickens atmosphere, reveals memory, and reweights the world rule about trees absorbing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus earned stasis; Elias accepts his role and the pieces’ return, with cost implied (he bears and transfers sorrow). Orientation is clear early, and the scene coheres without stray threads. The cost is quiet but legible on the page (“Somewhere, a tree was growing heavier”).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: gathering shards → first note struggle → trees’ hunger → mirror world singing back → communal reprise. Closure is on‑page with cost: light returns, windows shatter from fulfillment, and the night screams as it unravels. Orientation is clean from the outset; the final image reconfigures the premise (prison → door). No causality breaks; the tightening is purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive (causal spine with accumulative textural charge) holds: invitation → hidden stair → mirrors/Voss → annotated thesis → locking the door. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she breaks the midnight rule and abandons hiding as vocation. Setups pay off (the unlocked‑at‑midnight rule reweighted by the act of locking). The threshold motif coheres the turns without soft resets or convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build cleanly: warm bread → soil → wheat → citywide bread → communal and princely weeping → reappearing sign. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the city “stops adjusting,” and the ordinary “uncloaks,” with a conceptual cost of relinquished denial. Orientation is crisp early (first frost, tea house, Maple Lane), and planted strangenesses (river on Tuesdays) cohere. The price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture and clean causal spine: measure → invitation discovered → door marked “Remember” → bridge → crossing. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost (the library dissolves; he foregoes his role). Orientation is immediate and stable, and set‑ups (slide, vows, collapse) pay off. No convenience solves the problem; the door/bridge feel earned by pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a predominantly causal lens, the encounter tightens from approach → bait → self-incrimination → communal consequence. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she withholds trust, triggers the market’s old-rule punishment, and accepts the cost of letting the tide judge. The cost is legible in her final renunciation (“She didn’t need to hear it again”). Minor opacity remains around the exact mechanism of enforcement, though the text signals it clearly enough (“rules here were older than blood”).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: sensation-density builds until the decisive change of “she was becoming it” and the ring dissolving. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—the world teaches her she is the missing piece, with on-page final image (aurora compass rose) to prove it. Cost is conceptual (loss of tool, surrender of stance), not dramatic, but legible. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence culminating in a causal unlock: the lock→memory turn→painting splits→cache→painting frenzy→reframed door. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost (abandoning the lock, leaving the lantern, foreclosing the monochrome life). The magical mechanism is prefigured by the father’s line and mnemonic gift, keeping causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear accumulative/textural drive: map → descent → Archive question → writing → return with altered stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses to write unvarnished truth and refuses the new fragment, with cost signaled by the worn plate and drained ink. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; causal beats are clean. The pressure is internal but coherent and continuous.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the sculpture’s activation → bloom → spin → pulse → shatter escalates density toward a charged release. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page with cost (the ice’s sacrifice). The final cadence reconfigures the premise into a charged poise (“All she had to do was tune the world…”). No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain under a Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens: magnetic shift and failing systems → the box reframes his fear → controlled burn → departure. Closure lands on the page with cost via Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration (he resets the farm and relinquishes his role). Orientation is clean from the first lines (dome, twin suns, caretaker role), and the single-scene arc remains coherent. The burn and the release of fears are tightly linked; no “and-then” drift.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound motifs build (clang, tick, hum) to a resonant reconfiguration where the courtyard commits to replying. Orientation is clean from line one; the mailbox event tightens focus. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—choosing listening over solving—with a soft but legible cost (living with the unsolved). Stakes narrow once the mailbox yields and the letter reframes the scene’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a clean cadence shift when the dice trigger the console and the lab begins to flood. Closure lands on page: she opens the seals, accepts dissolution, surfaces; cost is visible (loss of journals, lab as tomb). Causality is coherent (dice → password demand → dance → LIBERATE → flooding). Orientation is clear from the opening image and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned objects and sensory density tighten toward the chamber’s rupture, then reconfigure at the end with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is clear early (lantern lighter at docks; beached whale; salt chamber). Closure lands on the page with cost (stone shatters, flowers ruined; he empties pockets, resumes work with a reweighted vow). The motif logic holds coherently across both shards.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere from stilling the brook to the lattice, the snapped thread, shatter, and reweighted hush. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy’s “scream” becomes a “sigh,” and she finally sleeps—at a cost (seared hand, lost thread, acceptance of incompletion). Orientation is clean early (summoner, brook, night). The final cadence ties prior images into a new stasis without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with causal spine: sugar knock → seal/lessons → blood contract → building speaks → Veyra vanishes → Elias inherits the role. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: knowledge binds; “agreements are tombs.” Costs are on‑page (blood, burn, burden of grief, role shift), and the final knock reframes the opening. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from garden/shell to lattice singing to patrol arrival; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing as memory escapes the quarantine system. Cost is on‑page (arrest; “chest was empty” after archiving) and persists in the world. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when). The final image—world “remembered back”—reweights the premise while keeping the price paid legible.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with a causal dominant: the thorn’s use unlinks decrees, the key crumbles, and the Emperor’s decision to learn drives a visible transformation. Closure lands on the page with both Decisive Change (decrees erased, orders to burn seals) and Resonant Reconfiguration (from noose to cradle). Orientation is clean from the opening and the throughline holds without dropped threads. The brief coda (child with slate) extends the causal arc without soft-resetting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: shell instruction → spiral descent with accruing signs → confrontation → song action → renunciation on the rim. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Earned Stasis: she severs the webs and then forecloses future listening by shattering the shell, with felt cost (“the universe… just a little quieter without her”). Orientation is clear from the first paragraph, and the single-scene frame stays tight. The sudden ability to sing the nexus reads earned via her identity as an echo singer and the shell’s earlier humming.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, single POV, clear anchors, and a clean accumulative/textural drive: ritual → revelation (child, not husband) → personal counter-ritual → charged poise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the widow’s re-seeing and Lena’s chosen partial holding. The shrine, globe, and locket are set up and paid off; no causality breaks. The before/after is legible without mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: sensory density and patterned actions (stir counts, whistle, moon path) accrete toward Liora’s initiation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the baton pass of the whisk and the “frame that held the world”—with a conceptual cost (value of invisible labor, acceptance of hiddenness). Orientation is clean and single‑scene. Cost is subtle rather than visceral, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (causal spine with textural charge): investigative entry → discovery of pit/diamond → experiential revelation → deliberate activation → reconfigured world. Closure lands with cost: Voss disappears, the orchard is gone, and a charged final image (the fruit humming) reframes the Liquidation as quarantine. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and each setup is paid off (letters, stillpoint, orchard thriving). The montage of visions risks abstraction but remains causally tethered to his contact with the diamond.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid, dominantly causal lens holds: transmissions → crack → attempted sealing → violent assertion through the receiver → reconfiguration of the portico and self. Closure is a decisive change with a charged final image (throne/scalpel), and the hinge line “Now he would speak” is paid off. Cost is present conceptually (relinquishing safety/identity, world consequences), if not deeply dramatized. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the scene stays within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: environmental music, jars, and the girl’s request accrue to a closure of Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost (letting go of ownership/hoarding). Orientation is crisp from the outset; the knock provides the single tightening needed. The closure is on‑page (she winds the box; he reframes his role, sets the melody playing as the sun climbs). Very minor convenience in timing (the visitor) but it doesn’t break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: thinning ice threatens → tuning plan → key turned → resonance redirected → artifact stabilized with on‑page cost. Orientation is swift (engineer, lighthouse, marina, artifact), and the drive lens reads Causal with lyric inflection. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with cost explicitly paid in body and a charged final image. No soft resets or unearned abilities; the bomb’s rule‑set holds.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the humming → tremor → rise progression yields a clean Charged Poise closure as Lior steps onto the ascending bridge. Orientation is crisp early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, viaduct) and maintained. Cost is legible in the social/ideological renunciation and the risk of the ice “long enough.” The pattern is taught and paid off without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: post‑drought pressure → investigation → discovery of sealed wall → deliberate strike → leak → decision to escalate via archives. Closure lands as Charged Poise: he renounces immediate containment for a riskier path to exposure, with on‑page cost (lost lantern, incoming flood). Orientation is established quickly (role, place, time) and held. Stakes are narrowed by his act creating imminent danger rather than deferring it.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build from winding and installation to music, decision, storm‑crossing, and mailed letter, culminating in continued letters. Closure is on the page with cost (the storm trek and acceptance of ongoing labor); the before/after is legible: waiting for absolution versus making it. Orientation is clean early: chaplain, shop, storm. No causality breaks; the tightening is modest but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and density build to a cadence shift where the wings “listen” and she conducts instead of falls. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: workshop sacrificed, arrow absorbed, bell deferred, and she recommits with cost on the page. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what) and the single scene tightens coherently. No causality gaps; the tightening derives from her choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: the number sequence → deep search → redirected logs → server coordinates → breach → restoration → termination notice → self‑sacrifice. Closure lands on the page with explicit cost (flagged for termination; she yields to deletion), functioning as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern of numbers is taught and paid off. No major causality seams or convenience patches.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and motifs tighten toward a Charged Poise closure as he steps onto the ice and the mirrors shatter. Orientation is firm early (who/where/when), and the throughline (vision → preparation → decision) coheres. The cost is legible as risk and renunciation of his default role, though not paid out on the page. The shard-to-mirrors-to-step progression pays off cleanly without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear orientation (Iceland, trawler, relief stint) feeds a causal chain: rescue → recognition/community mirroring → heirloom reveal → canceled appointment → charged final listen. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she forecloses a scheduled death to remain with uncertainty. The heirloom’s unscrewing is a convenient hinge but seeded throughout, preserving coherence. The final charged poise—listening to the ice—pays the setup without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the letter’s fragment tightens pressure; sketching catalyzes a reframing that closes in Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; causal coherence between discovery, reflection, and final stance is clean. Cost is legible in the acceptance of solitude and foreclosed reunion, crystallized by tucking the letter over his heart and returning to work. Minor reliance on reflective summary is balanced by concrete on‑page beats.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory and tonal density as the clearing frays then re‑sharpens. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she restores the boundary “long enough,” accepts the unfixable, and departs with cost (“weight in her chest eased just enough”). Orientation is clean early; causality coheres via consecration → song → stabilization. The cost is legible on the page and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: waiting for the light, child/butterfly arrival, and the shadow’s stretch tighten into the shutter click. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the image reconfigures the town’s grief at a felt cost (her carried weight and long patience). Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence holds. The cost is quiet rather than acute, but it’s legible in the “weight changed” and town‑scale stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: pattern discovery through sound and silence culminates in a conceptual repricing and a chosen step into community. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when). The closure lands on the page with cost—leaving the sanctuary and revaluing his life’s work—though the price remains more conceptual than visceral. Because/therefore beats are coherent within the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story escalates through motif density toward a resonant Earned Stasis: he abandons the locating practice. Orientation is clear and the single turn (the sculpture animating; the tape’s voice) coherently tightens pressure. The cost is on‑page—he snaps the arrows and relinquishes the chalk and search. Causality is soft but consistent with the chosen mode; no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pressure builds from the spinning hand to the turret touch to the observatory’s “release.” Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he refuses to fix, redefines constancy, and departs—paid for by relinquishing his lifelong role. Orientation is clear early, and the causal thread within the lyric logic is coherent. The on‑page cost is legible in the final decision to leave the hand spinning and walk away.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through motifs to a resonant reconfiguration when she releases the shard and re-commits to playing “for the living.” Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when), and the closure carries cost legibly on the page. The nurse arrival and the “edge of the haven” transition are coherent and support the cadence shift. Stakes are quiet but decisively resolved without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: key → automaton awakens → revelation → second key/door → crossing through light → library → first door. Closure lands on the page with cost: departure from her world, risk of becoming “the first shadow to walk at noon,” and the spent key turned to ash. The lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, held through the end; the final Charged Poise/CR image reweights noon/light/shadow. Orientation is anchored early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal—gap → tooth → changeling → bargain → restoration—reads cleanly with on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is swift and firm; the well/tooth mechanics track. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt (she relinquishes the tooth and accepts a reconfigured world), making the victory a touch easy. Still, set‑ups (needle, memory flood) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene densifies until the arrival of the child reframes stake from private ritual to lineage transfer. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Liora passes the glass and forecloses the solitary keeper path with a felt conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early (grotto, night, vocation). The cost is quiet but legible in the renunciation and the friction with village norms.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from sanctuary to shared tending to a charged transfer (the pendant). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she relinquishes her heirloom anchor and commits to “moss” with a felt price. Orientation is clear early; causal coherence holds. The final image reweights the premise with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: cameos densify, the faceless figure articulates the debt, the cadence breaks when he listens and writes, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clean early (who, where, why). The price—dissolution and disappearance—is on the page. The shell and nexus persistently shape options through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: arbor failing because songs are forgotten; therefore Mira chooses song over tools; therefore the arbor revives and her role reconfigures. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a modest cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene cohesion holds. Escalation is smooth rather than contested, but coherent under a causal/lyric hybrid.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps mount to the sealing and the map’s pulse, then reprice the premise. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when established), and set‑ups (flash‑paper, plate, orchard, starlight) all pay off. Closure lands on the page with cost (blood, patience, relinquished urgency) and a reweighted rule (“teach light to stay”). The single tightening—nothing happens, then warmth—creates a precise cadence break.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of patterning and urgency of the wounded season tighten toward the on‑page payoff of the lullaby. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he makes it work and chooses to leave it running), with conceptual cost in the risk and the fleeting season. Orientation is crisp early; single scene coherence is strong. Cost is more implied than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: match → orientation → calcifications → grotto’s counterpressure → realization → surrender. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost—she becomes part of the grotto’s hush; the villagers’ shard confirms the price. Beats link cleanly and escalate without outline-y “and then” sequencing. The method’s mechanics (flame aligned to fissures) keep causality legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual work, market exchange, dream, and morning culminate in the charged decision to keep one carving. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes the act from containing to letting pass, with the lion kept as lesson. Orientation is clear early (loft, kettle, routine), and the final image pays off seeded motifs (rain, skylight, knife, kettle). The cost is legible in the refusal to sell and the acceptance of what cannot be held.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of objects and images (carousel, lagoon, camera wheel, bridge) coheres to a charged closure: she jumps and lets the lagoon take her, an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with clear cost. Orientation is clean early, and the rule set (lagoon as memory) holds through the final image where “it remembered.” The decisive act is on the page and reconfigures options: surrender to the past rather than bargaining out of it. The constraint persists into the last beat via many-hands imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative-textural dominance at the end: a causal chain (find sextant → align → redirect flows → repurpose) builds to a conceptual repricing of “hope.” Orientation is clean from the first lines; single POV, one scene window, and stakes cohere. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/CR: she forecloses “restore the spaceport” and revalues hope as redirection, with a visible plan and the vane-to-horizon image. The cost is subtle but legible as opportunity/professional risk and a communal reframing rather than triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of hush/whisper motifs builds to a cadence shift when sound finally escapes. Closure lands with cost (breaking the forecourt, defying doctrine, relinquishing perfectionism) and a reweighted rule (“he didn’t measure the silence. He let it measure him.”). Orientation is clean from the outset; the single scene flows. The final image reconfigures meaning without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images and choices build to a clean closure: she abandons the quest’s proof (ledger) and reconfigures meaning via the sundial. Orientation is solid from the outset, and the canal split → marsh turn → renunciation sequence coheres. Cost is on the page (forfeiting coordinates and potential auction value) and the final steer back toward the docks crystallizes the after. A minor neatness in the “inward‑pointing” shadow flirts with convenience but stays metaphorically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: detail density builds to the fulgurite’s revelation and the charged act of splicing the seed pod. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the rope redefined as an archive and Elias choosing stewardship. Cost is largely conceptual (accepting custodianship, stepping into the fog), but it’s legible in the charged final images. Orientation is clean from the opening, and there’s no causality breach.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs and sensory density tighten toward the locket discovery and the decision to reframe the prince’s absence. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: Elias commits to telling the princess a non‑binary truth and to boarding the next ship as a “cartographer” of in‑between. Cost is felt but soft (accepting absence, withholding objects briefly); still, the before/after stance is legible. Orientation is clean early; structure holds to one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is clear, with a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure: the “broken miracle” reweights the quest with visible cost (palace shudder, ugly song). Orientation is crisp by paragraph two and the lens holds; beats accrue toward the hatch and first flight. The price is felt though not fully paid on page, which suits the design. Slight mechanical convenience (tools working first try) keeps it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominance: motifs accrue (coin, thread, obsidian, clouds) and then hinge on a situational test (the boy’s injury), resolving in a charged final cadence (alarm, coin pulsing). Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to mending fire with fire, paid for in blood and social suspicion. Orientation is clean and the throughline holds causally and texturally. The rescue is a single tightening rather than a full turn, but it’s enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: breadcrumbs → Bone Fountain → glass box aligns → vault → pull → city reconfigured. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and aftermath (voices, fountains of light), with a conceptual cost (uncontrollable release, departure). Orientation is swift and steady; the drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric texture. The price is felt but not deeply individualized, tempering peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: patterning of petals/gear/sonar densifies into a path and a trade. Closure is on‑page and costly: she relinquishes a memory, builds a resonant bridge, and steps into transit—a decisive change with lingering price. Orientation is immediate (nebula garden, gear, ancestry), with a single scene that tightens cleanly. The “approximating the infinite” motif threads through to the gear’s final stillness, reweighting the end.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via motifs (butterflies, ribbon, chisel) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the gravestone becomes a vessel. Closure lands on the page with cost: he abandons the safety of engraving names for carving absence and commits to teaching his daughter within the migration’s window. Orientation is clean early; the two-shard dinner transition is smooth and purposeful. A few aphoristic lines skim didactic, but causality and cadence hold.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of names/weights and the pendulum’s pause builds to a resonant reconfiguration: a new cadence acknowledged by village and self. Who/where/when is anchored early; causality is clean (carving and pressure on the bob alter time’s chime). The cost is legible on the page (defiance of council, self‑indictment, enduring consequences). The final act of beginning the next name seals the before/after without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: each untied knot escalates consequence (breath → scent → voices → vision) culminating in a reweighted understanding and a poised decision. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and props pay off (sovereign case, tapestry). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: he reframes “burial” into “unraveling” and resets the chessboard to enact that choice at dawn. The felt cost is chiefly conceptual and anticipatory rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the scene coheres around one stake and a single cadence shift when the spire “sings.” Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—coaxing, not forcing—made legible by the ink’s lift and resettling. The cost is implied more than dramatized, keeping it short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates through density—the Ministry’s brutality, the illicit broadcast, Lira’s arrival—toward a charged final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: Elias’s absence and the city’s walls echo the forbidden line, with cost legible in the empty alcove and dry inkwell. Orientation is clean early; causal seams hold within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from burning → powder “snow” → rocking chair’s stop → departure, culminating in a charged poise/earned stasis. Orientation is clear early (gallery, mask, ashes), and the closure’s cost—choosing the lie that holds “for now,” fleeing before permanence—lands on the page. The chair’s halt and the fading powder articulate a before/after cadence shift. No causal gaps threaten coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational lens held: warning → week of siege-prep → confrontation → flooding. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with explicit cost: he stands, the pumps start, he’s swallowed by dark as the clerk rewrites the record. Causal coherence is tight; the Archive’s plan escalates inevitability without coincidence. The final image (cog settling, “ticking”) reconfigures meaning with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene accrues presence (arrival → rosette placed → shared hum) to a charged poise closure. The cost—accepting a remnant instead of a restored choir—is on the page and reweights options. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the final shimmer reads as a resonant reconfiguration, not a fix. No causality slips or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → cultivation → tasting → feeding → renunciation, culminating in saving a seed. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/CR with a visible social cost (defying elders/critics) and a reweighted role. Orientation is clean from the opening. Minor convenience in the plant’s rapid success slightly reduces pressure but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → riddle/seed decision → climb → seed in node → drones revive → communal re-seeing; closure lands as a charged repricing (“invitation”) with the on‑page cost of relinquishing the last seed. The drive lens reads Causal with a lyric overlay, held consistently through the final image of anticipatory sunrise. Stakes and consequence feel coherent across beats with no orientation debt. Slight ease in the mechanical success prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through ritualized acts and sensory density to a resonant reconfiguration and renunciation. Orientation is clear early (bay, dock, spring evening) and the closure lands on the page (“She left the shard…” and “She was carrying it with her”). Cost is present and coherent with the premise. Minor note: the causal scaffolding is intentionally soft, but the cadence shift is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural holds: revelations compound and culminate in a concrete act (“thread the needle”) that reconfigures options. Closure lands on-page with cost (helmet removed; old world’s “mercy” relinquished; ampoule repurposed). Causal links read clean: Liora’s pressure → dropped ampoule → seam press → dome splits → transformation. Orientation is firm early; no lens slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑POV, one scene with one purposeful shard (the café door) lands clear closure: Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing as she refuses to rewrite the past. Causality is clean: dice test → pattern reveal → lateral move → door → renunciation. Cost is on the page (surrendering the “fix,” leaving the smooth die). The hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds (moon/brush/leaf/script) toward a resonant reconfiguration when he sleeps and the world subtly shifts. Orientation is clean within the opening: who, where, when are clear. Closure carries cost on the page—the leaf is gone, the brush is worn, and sleep breaks the 43‑night vigil. The because/therefore is soft but sufficient under the chosen lens: laughter → inscribing → shimmer → tide of sleep.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: lens as pattern-teacher → oven test → waterfall revelation → decisive break. Closure lands with on-page cost (destroying the lens) and a reweighted system of preservation (skills dispersed into many hands). Because/therefore linkages track cleanly and pay off in the dawn baking image. The cost persists via embedded shards and the relinquishment of singular authority.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: setup → activation → descent → aftermath, with on‑page cost (erasure, the tide swallowing the path, the lighthouse’s final silence). Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “unmaking the future” reframes the premise as he exits the system. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; world rules emerge through action. The clocks running backward on the mainland widen consequence without breaking the tight scene logic.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: instructions → entry/absorption → confrontation → through‑lunge → extraction → reweighted final image. Closure lands on the page with cost: the double dissolves, the clasp “now held a new kind of hunger,” and the curse persists. Hybrid lens with causal spine and lyric accumulation holds; no orientation debt. The final photo image confirms a before/after without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through iterative strikes that reshape clouds until the sea’s hum arrives and the “heart” strike crystallizes a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear early; the closure’s cost is implied (risk of storm, possible sink or soar) rather than paid, but the stakes are legible. Tight and coherent without causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density and cadence tighten: whistle → resonance → watchers advance → shells translate → twin gate revelation → charged crossing. Orientation is clean within the first lines (Vahroon, turtles, sealed gate, horizon watchers). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise with conceptual cost: he crosses into what took the lost; the city physically reconfigures. The causal thread is coherent without over-explaining, though the cost remains more conceptual than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens with a situational spine: texted threat → arrival of Callahan → police imminent → Elias’s choice to reveal the larger pattern and renounce the crate. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he foregoes possession of the Codex in favor of disseminable proof, accepting ongoing risk. Orientation is immediate and stable; the before/after is legible in the shift from object to pattern. Cost is present (loss of artifact control; institutional opposition), if more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern (notes, water, iron, ink) and closes with a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he relinquishes the inkwell, adopts the Keeper’s ethos, and reweights his vocation. Orientation is clean from the drawbridge to the pavilion to the library. Cost is legible on the page in the exchange of the heirloom and the foreclosed ordinary life.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: stamp → coordinates → sealed chamber → book with his name → decision to keep it secret. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis with conceptual cost: he accepts solitude and secrecy to preserve the “reclaimed stillness.” Orientation is clean early; the blackout clock and the ocean pressure persist as constraints. The cost is quiet but legible in the refusal to share and in the returned noise after three days.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through patterned images (glass, tea, cranes) to a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost as she becomes part of the recording and relinquishes herself (“The lantern maker let go”). Orientation is clean early; the basilica’s paradox (“descend while ascend”) is taught and then repriced at the end as “unfolding.” The final rise into the place where dreams are kept is a decisive reweighting with conceptual and emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean (observatory during a storm, three weeks post-strike, single POV); the causal chain from frequency entry to field collapse to the charged glimpse is tight. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes agency from altering outcomes to reclaiming stance, with the observatory’s failure as tangible cost. The hybrid lens (causal steps toward an accumulative thematic end) is held. No soft reset; alarms and blackout mark the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: drone detects chip → theft → chip pulses → seam opens → constellation projects → relationship reconfigures. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: Lena relinquishes possession and lets connection replace surveillance, with a felt cost in anonymity and non‑ownership. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). The drive lens reads dominantly causal with lyric texture and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single scene, single POV, clean anchors, and a Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance that coheres at closure. The closure is a Charged Poise/renunciatory turn: he discards the token and commits to meet the note’s tomorrow, accepting cost. The driftwood’s split and the dated note risk convenience, but they function as pressure rather than resolution. Causal beats link well enough to carry the ending’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene with tight causal flow: refusal → adjusted terms → symbolic lever → handshake → retrieval of the boy. Closure lands on the page with cost (he parts with the heirloom; the war persists) and a reweighted final image. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph. The Decisive Change (boy freed) and Earned Stasis (war limps on) cohere cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds pressure through recurring objects (compass, poles, letters) to an Earned Stasis: he forecloses departure and chooses to read and stay. Orientation is clear from the outset and the one transition (launch → town) is clean. The cost is legible on the page—he abandons the sea’s call and accepts the backlog of letters. The throughline from “align needle and pulse” to setting the compass down at the bar solidifies closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain under a Hybrid leaning Causal lens: coded newspaper → tunnel → lake → throw → path → surface → chess. Closure lands on the page via Decisive Change (he chooses to rebuild), with cost signaled physically (collapse) and conceptually (forfeiture of the “way back”). Orientation is clean within ~120 words and the two‑shard transition is legible. No teleports or set‑ups left unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats accrue toward a charged repricing: first attempt’s shimmer, second attempt’s wrong return, then the fortune’s ash and identity turn. Orientation is clean early (orchard, moon, whisperer, brother’s burial), and cause/effect within the magical premise stays coherent. Closure lands on the page with cost—the bond cannot be reclaimed; instead, she accepts metamorphosis. The phoenix‑thinned veil functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → hum → apparition → ledger → shatter → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (she loses the possibility of grasping him; the saucer breaks) and a reweighted premise (time as reservoir). Orientation is crisp by ~120 words; no causality breaks within the story’s magical logic. The acorn and the unfastening bind a before/after with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: repeated stitching attempts deepen pressure until the decisive push opens the tear. Closure lands on‑page with cost: the ship is gone, identity reconfigured, tear seals. Orientation is crisp early (Eulogy, observation deck, birth log), and all set‑ups (photo, Kwan Yin’s tear, gravity flicker) pay off at climax. The causal throughline (try/fail/try/push) reads inevitable within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from the hush and receding sea to the prophecy and the lava-choice, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what). Closure lands on the page with cost: she trades her light for fire and departs into a reweighted world. The causal thread is lyrical but consistent (water flees → mountain speaks → prophecy → decisive act).

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: blackout + sundial window → hatch → gearwork lock → opened armory → signal. Closure is on‑page with a decisive change and a resonant final image (light returns, but the world has changed). Cost is implied (risk of alarms/light flare) more than dramatized in consequence, keeping tension credible but not crushing. Single‑scene focus holds the lens without cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern density and image cadence escalate toward a decisive act (the push) and a reweighted world (eels return, anchors set). Because/therefore links hold from rock placement → dust activation → aurora ring → mirror/unraveling → anchoring → return. Cost is on the page and persists. The single-scene structure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm + timer + poem build to a resonant renunciation with clear cost (tearing and scattering the poem). Orientation is clean from the outset and the motif chain pays off at closure. The persistent constraints (storm, crack in dome, timer) shape tactics and the final image. Quiet but decisive cadence shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: card placement → angle inference → light trace → notch → key → alliance. Single-scene window honors scope, and closure lands with a decisive change (partners over petitioners) with a plausible social cost (abandoning the Council’s verdict). Lens: Causal with a light conceptual repricing at the end; held consistently. Minor softness in explicit on-page cost prevents the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (bloom, tin, names) densify toward a charged poise where Elias chooses the work—violet to Maren, pen to page—reweighting the stake. Closure lands with felt cost (renunciation of leaving, risk of guards) even as the future remains open. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality slips. The ending’s cadence shift is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with causal dominance: compasses → projector/reel → door → reunion. Closure lands on‑page with a decisive shift from waiting to encounter; the clock’s chime and steady pendulum mark the turn. Cost is felt rather than tallied (years of endurance, the projector’s death, the leave‑behind), which is sufficient but not searing. Structure is clean with one controlled transition and no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative: density builds to the bite and a conceptual repricing—“The dreams weren’t echoes… the island itself, trying to remember her.” Closure lands with cost (identity rewritten; name forgotten) made explicit in the final image. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the monsoon clock organizes the beat sequence. Minor exposition about prior cataloging remains integrated and doesn’t stall causality.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues through ritual actions until a resonant reconfiguration lands with cost. Closure is on‑page—planting the compass forecloses a stance of open wound and accepts a charged stasis. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the needle’s color shift to cerulean marks the decisive cadence change. One hairline softness: causal mechanics are mystical but consistent, not undermining the ending.

    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned spice imagery and grief echoes to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending, with felt cost in Liora's porous self; orientation anchors early in the orchard under the moon, though minor elision in the brother's burial pays off at closure without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered images and memories, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the saucer's shattering and Liora's release, with felt cost in unfastening grief; orientation anchors early in the glade. One meaningful cadence shift at the brother's revelation reweights knowledge. Slight ambiguity in the brother's manifestation feels purposeful but could tighten causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs of stitching and tears, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lien steps through with conceptual cost of unraveling her stitches like a ladder; orientation anchors early in the observation deck with the birth log. Closure lands on-page with the dimension breathing and Lien staying, reweighting her as the "first" with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices, though causality feels more poetic than strict linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images and cadence shifts, with orientation anchored early in the black sand beach scene. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing as Elira trades light for fire, reweighting her premise with undeniable cost in the raft's transformation. One meaningful deepening suffices, from cave prophecy to lava hurling, with causality holding via motivated ellipses.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Causal lens, the plot builds through because/therefore linkages from planning to blackout alignment, leading to the armory unlock as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost in the fort's broken grip. Orientation anchors early with the fort on the cliffside and Kael at the gate, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with the signal flame and Kael's disappearance, reconfiguring the world, though the villagers' response is off-page, slightly softening the final causality.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns build density to a resonant reconfiguration via earned stasis, with conceptual cost legible in the dust settling into her bones and ongoing rock-placing.

Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure, as the vigil shifts from holding to release, shaped by persistent constraints like the timer's chime.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a causal lens, the plot chains tightly from the needle card flick to the rapier interception and sundial compartment reveal, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where they reprice the verdict's value with the conceptual cost of their waited time; orientation anchors immediately in the atrium, and the single-scene structure holds without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images like the tin, violet, and moon, leading to a Charged Poise closure where the itch quiets and they plant resistance, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost of potential molting. Orientation anchors who (Elias, Maren), where (rusted prison library), and when (moonlit night) by the first paragraph without debt. Causality is motivated ellipsis, with beats advancing knowledge via shared sorting and the violet's addition to the hoard. Final image reconfigures options, earning stasis with visible persistence under guards' threat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and object callbacks to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the reunion, with felt cost in the long-war metaphor and clock chiming. Orientation anchors early in the tidal arbor station. Closure lands on-page with the encore reweighting past longing. One meaningful deepening suffices, but ellipsis in the path's emergence feels slightly unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of seeds, dreams, and ridge to a resonant reconfiguration in Liora's revelation and transformation, with conceptual cost legible in her becoming the island's voice; orientation anchors early with Liora on the ridge. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost in her altered mind, pointedly in "I’m the one who remembers" line.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the empty vial tucked “like a relic” crystallizes an Earned Stasis—he foregoes control and accepts witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each return to the greenhouse layers pattern until the final cadence shift. One causal gap: the leap from “dust reveals absence” to “I will stop chasing stars” is inferred rather than forced by an on-page trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: beats add density (charcoal smell, star fade) rather than causal chains. Ledger discovery is the tightening; letting it fall creates Resonant Reconfiguration—a crystallized pause with the canyon exhaling as felt cost. Orientation and closure meet the 8-band gate with minor slippage in brother causal thread.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the world “hummed… vibrating with the memory of sound.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat thickens texture until silence liquefies. Cost is visible in torn fingertips and the mentor’s absence. One micro-turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is CR: the final ledger gesture reweights the central theme—rest is acknowledgment, not escape—with visible conceptual cost. Cause-to-effect holds (lens warmth → climb → stillness signal → restored dead → accepting self-name) under the hybrid lens that becomes Textural/Resonant at the end. The one micro-turn (adding his name) crystallizes stakes without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell-ring and food drop layers density until the twelve-fold challenge crystallizes community stance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is earned reconfiguration under a Causal/Accumulative hybrid: the memory ruptures when Elias breathes against the jade, foreclosing the option to merely observe and redirecting him to custody instead of discovery. Linkage from twilight images of drifting embers → camera obscura → vanishing jade → new keeper stance is causal yet lyrical. Cost is legible in the literal loss of the charm and the audible humming of the viaduct stones. The final child-shadow projects future recursion without diluting present arc.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “garden sighing” and Liora stepping sideways reweights the premise (texture becomes something to survive, not solve).

Cost is legible—“bones aching,” “ragged breath,” last grain felt under palm.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wall forgotten, the future armed with life. Causal lens holds—every beat is linked by “because/therefore” logic from key sequence to planted seed. The cost is legible in the emptied pockets and the guard’s shouts fading behind her. Orientation is anchored within 120 words and never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the copper’s memory reweights “trust” from breakage to erosion, costing Elias the greenhouse and his compulsion to name.

The aurora’s pulse and the forge’s breath tighten the cadence to an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern shifts (portraits, flowers, moonbeams) reweight meaning at the end. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise as destiny answers—but orientation remains misty and head-hopping into the mirror threatens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the flood rewrites the ruins while Elara walks away, bookmark left as invitation/warning. Causal chain holds—thaw reveals blueprint → bookmark cues sequence → valve releases flood. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the relinquished control room and the unrecognizable path ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (shell whisper → cast clue → ledger discovery) narrows options toward the decisive act of taking proof. Orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is earned by a conceptual repricing: the violin's final note becomes the robot's original name, crystallizing self-knowledge under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds as each echo threads into the courtyard's dissolving pocket of time. Visible cost is the forfeiture of the courtyard and prior identity—the courtyard "sang" while X-7 "began to remember," so the price is legible. Early orientation is fuzzy but taught quickly via time-fold mechanics paying off at the end; passes orientation test under waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain’s afterglow, ticket doodles, and lens-light fragments layer until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—tickets luminous, mistrust thawed—felt cost legible in Lena’s lighter heart and relinquished silence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished marble layers pattern until the final image reframes “luck” as uncountable. Closure lands in the garden’s choice to mend glass with living vines—Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (elders’ ledgers stay closed). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens opens with twilight murmur and accumulates pressure in repeating rhythmic beats: clock slippage, AI queries, specimen flickers, lever pulls, each layer charging the final image until Elias rests his hand on the quiet hum. The orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and closure meets the Resonant Reconfiguration bar when the lab rewrites itself into “a shore, a nest, [...] before a first flight” and then yields to “elsewhen.” The felt cost is visible but slightly understated; the moment edges rather than cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the duet achieved by “a single, sustained note” reweights the opera house from tomb to living instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat thickens the hush and decay until the final image crystallizes the keeper’s Earned Stasis—“let the library swallow them whole.” Closure is on-page, cost is felt, pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s first hum and the ridge’s answering song reweight the premise—healing is remembering, not repairing. Causality holds: the eclipse is foreshadowed, the vial is seeded early, and the ridge’s response is earned by Elias’s childhood memory. Cost is legible in Lila’s relinquishing the keepsake and Elias’s acceptance of lifelong custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the world tilts, the tapestry warms, and Elias accepts unbalance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object and diary fragment layers resonance until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the ash words and the hook behind his ribs.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Liora’s decision to paint a door and step through it is a Decisive Change that forecloses her prior identity as mere restorer. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each mural loop and coin return intensifies pattern until the pattern itself becomes the exit. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors (“heart of the sound wave garden”) arrive within 40 words. Minor lens wobble: the old man’s “question you haven’t spoken” edges toward meta-exposition, but the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost, keeping the score above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The hybrid Situational/Accumulative lens holds: the oath translations split the kingdom (setup), pressure tightens as torches approach, and the restored chorus reconfigures meaning—closure arrives via resolute song with felt cost of her voice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens (tremble-letter reveals sluice system → choice forced on elders) holds cleanly. Closure as Decisive Change: blueprint + chain on table re-configures valley's future with felt cost shown in elders' shadows pooling like ink.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias hums, accepting the cost of imperfect song, and the attic’s silence is reweighted. Causal chain—meteorite → letter → pigeon → returned sheet music—holds without gaps. The lens is Causal; each beat tightens options until the final refusal to stay silent.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)

Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the box and sending the image crystallizes a stance shift—pain is alchemized rather than transferred.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    This is an Accumulative/Textural drive: layering patterns of erasure until the lone egg reframes the entire landscape. Closure lands cleanly in the crystallizing image “the cracks would hold the story”—a Conceptual Repricing that makes before (a man who profits from absence) indivisible from after (keeper of a singular presence). Orientation perfect: salt-crust, distant storm, Elias alone established in first 3 lines. Cost explicit in the final sentence’s echo-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis: Liora’s renunciation of outside validation when the gates seal behind her locks a path with palpable cost. Causal drive is stable under Accumulative/Textural lens—because untangling, absorbing, walking away—but the mechanism by which individual threads equate to audible memories is never taught, weakening causality at a pivotal moment.

Minor lens wobble early (accumulative orchard vs. situational pressure) resolves by end.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure turns on “her name was Liora,” producing Charged Poise and Earned Stasis as the Library seals him in a gap; causality tightens from stolen diary → lure → foreclosure.

    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pond’s stillness reconfigures the lesson from vanishing to appearing; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern (stone → ripple → memory) tightens to final image with felt conceptual cost—Elias surrenders his own timeline to the student’s future gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality holds under Situational lens: the anomaly forces a crystallization of stance rather than a plot turn. Closure is Earned Stasis—he stays, becoming a still pulse. Cost arrives in the last third as “the Hollow Maw passed beneath him, its hunger unmet,” but it is off-stage, muting the punch of loss; 8.5 suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive is Situational/Accumulative: every beat reweights “sacred ≠ automated.” The mist-walk reveal and candle’s final roar form a Resonant Reconfiguration—cost is the candle’s irreverent fire rejecting the city’s hollowness.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dish shatters, the note persists inside her, and the gorge sings back—an undeniable before/after. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of silence-as-presence intensifies until the final image reweights gravity itself. One causal seam: the fragment’s return to the statue’s hand is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity survives.
