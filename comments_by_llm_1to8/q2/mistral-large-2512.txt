  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (Liora, canyon creek, post-fire) and follows a causal-investigative lens: ledger → frost patterns → Jaren → revelation. The closure moment—Liora folding the strip and keeping it as "a choice"—reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing her shift from victim to agent, though the cost (what she's choosing to risk or forfeit) remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jaren's confession reframes the fire from personal attack to systemic threat, changing her understanding and options.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the heat-map erupts in color, Elias "finally heard the music," silence gains a language. Orientation is prompt (conservatory, Elias, satchel, tuning fork case). The weeks-long middle compresses goal-directed work without escalation or reversal; the final strike transforms the frame but the stakes never narrow or face contradiction. Cost is implied (silence "vast and suffocating" persists) but the page shows triumph more than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through density increase (package → wading → library → desk → lenses glowing → reading → light returns) and a cadence shift at closure when "the light returned" and he "felt still." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the undertaker accepts the role of keeper and gives rest to the drowned city, foreclosing his prior isolation with visible emotional cost ("For the first time in years, he felt still"). Orientation anchors arrive early (undertaker, workbench, package). One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers the logbook and understands the promise. Cost is legible: he closes his eyes and accepts the burden, a micro-choice that ends his prior restlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: donations trickle in, midnight runs establish a ritual, the second bell reweights the first, and the final image (children holding bells, echoes in amplified quiet) reconfigures the community's endurance into a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Causality is lateral—each beat deepens rather than reverses—and the closure lands with felt cost (the quiet defiance against tightening sanctions, the unspoken bond crystallized). One persistent constraint (sanctions) shapes tactics throughout. The note "Ring it when they forget" charges the final act without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (viaduct, camera obscura, Lien's purpose). The dominant stake—understanding where unused love goes—is signaled early and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the realization that love is stored in others' hands). However, the father and child appear abruptly from the mist without prior setup or causal motivation, reading as coincidental arrival to enable closure rather than a turn earned by Lien's prior choices. The tear's glow and the boy's recovery feel unearned; no prior on-page rules establish the mechanics, reducing closure cost legibility. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (memory fragments, fog, breath) but the final beat leans on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (garden), and the inciting object (halo fragment) within the first third. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara wakes in the garden, photographs restored, fragment gone, aged "not in the way of years"—a Charged Poise moment where touching time has exacted a felt if oblique cost. However, causality stumbles at the closure beat: the mechanism by which pressing the fragment to her mother disintegrates the woman, restores all photographs (not just that one), and ages Elara remains unexplained, reading as coincidental resolution rather than earned consequence. The daughter/mother genealogy confusion noted in Q1 also clouds the stakes at the peak turn. Drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture (garden hums, photographs fade, willows whisper), but the final turn lacks because/therefore linkage—applying the artifact fixes everything off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (carnival, cuffs, Vey). The causal chain holds: arrow signals vault claim → keys unlock progression → scavenger recognizes boundary → vault access → seed dispersal mission. The closure offers Charged Poise—stepping into dawn with mission clarity and the regime's wall fallen—but the cost remains implied rather than viscerally demonstrated on the page. The "time for growing had begun" articulates theme but doesn't fully dramatize what Mira or Vey have foreclosed or risked in this specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Elias, greenhouse ruins, present-tense return framed against childhood memory. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—childhood synesthesia seeds the adult quest, the forge and foil accumulate symbolic weight, and the final imprint delivers Conceptual Repricing: he captures not his grandfather's answer but his own artifact of betrayal with visible cost (the wife's lie, his impending death). Causality is clean within the textural mode—each beat deepens the thematic register—but the climactic act (feeding foil, cooling imprint) remains visually vague: we don't see what the imprint shows or how "silence" registers on metal, which slightly weakens the closure's legibility. The ending's "it was something" lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost, though the mechanics of success are elided.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: moonbeams and flowers accumulate symbolic charge toward the final shared-light image. Orientation anchors (emerald station, evening train, Lira with satchel) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira and Kael refuse the train and stand together in shared light—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a specific forfeited option. The missed train represents opportunity, yet the text never establishes what Lira was traveling toward or what she surrenders by staying, weakening the before/after contrast required for tight RR closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (control room, Elias, present winter thaw) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: sensory and reflective density builds toward the final switch-flipping as symbolic closure. However, the closure image (machines whirring, thaw continuing) offers reconfiguration without a clear visible cost—what path does Elias foreclose by activating the panel? The orb he never finished and the studio he left are mentioned but not dramatized as lost options at the ending beat. Cost proof test fails; apply −0.6 in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the photograph reveals the caretaker's role; Mira's "let's start over" crystallizes a stance), but the cost remains abstract—what path is foreclosed? The causality is functional: seashell whispers → desk → cast → floorboard → box → photo. However, the caretaker's sudden passivity (he "didn't move to stop her") and the convenient discovery sequence weaken escalation. Drive lens is Causal with sufficient linkage, though the final beat's emotional pivot lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraphs, avoiding orientation debt. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and cadence build toward the final release. However, the closure—standing on the shore, letting the tide take the leaf—feels more like poetic tableau than a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost; we cannot point to an exact sentence where a path is foreclosed or options reweighted with felt price. The "map" revelation is told rather than dramatized through a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—loops layer sensation and deepen the central question until collapse into "a single, seamless moment." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): E-7X accepts pursuit without resolution, resuming work with altered purpose. Cost is conceptual (abandoning certainty) and felt in "slower now, deliberate." Orientation anchors promptly (frozen courtyard, E-7X, mop). One weakness: the loop collapse mechanism is asserted ("pressed his forehead…loops collapsed") rather than dramatized through a visible price or tactical shift, softening the closure's on-page legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean by ~60 words (Mira, night registrar, cinema entrance). The lens is Causal: Elias's eavesdropping confession causes Mira's realization, which narrows options and leads to the mutual offer to "start over" with visible cost (abandoning pretense, exposing vulnerability). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lens placed back into the projector crystallizes their new stance, and the final line reweights the silence from barrier to beginning. Cost is felt in the admission of years spent "pretending," though a more concrete forfeiture on the page would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The marble appearances, strategic placements, and the crack-map guide create a coherent escalation; the final seedling discovery and Elias's choice to scatter the marbles constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with felt cost—he relinquishes control and trusts the garden's judgment. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening (the garden responds, then guides) tightens the dominant stake. Cost is legible: "The garden had never been his to control, only to tend."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Elara pulling the lever and glimpsing sideways moments—qualifies as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost remains abstract: alarms blare and the AI "demands an explanation," yet no concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing appears on the page. The nexus collapse and xenos stirring gesture toward consequence without dramatizing a price that alters Elara's options. The lens holds through because/therefore linkage (adjustment → nexus pulse → lever → vision → collapse) but the final cost is told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: water imagery, the program's evolving inscriptions, and the spectral tableau deepen toward the moment Lena plays and the images animate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the symphony is given voice, Elias smiles and vanishes, the program blanks—but cost is implied rather than dramatically visible (no forfeiture, injury, or social price on the page). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the program's notes rearrange and Lena recognizes the lost symphony, narrowing her options to performance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. The illustration arrival, Elias's identification of the flower, the descent and excavation, and the photograph discovery form a clear because/therefore chain that narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he accepts that prophecy's burden is presence, not accuracy—with visible cost: years of guilt finally grounded. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note reweights his guilt: "You were wrong, but so were we." The closure image (breathing without prophecy's weight, illustration as reminder) reconfigures prior material with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece holds a situational lens: Elias enters, observes escalating strangeness, and crystallizes a stance by offering the valve wheel. Orientation anchors (mill, explorer, flashlight, night) arrive early. The closure—handing over the wheel, the clanking stops, "the hush that followed was louder than any confession"—reads as Charged Poise: options reconfigure and pressure is undeniable, though the conceptual cost (accepting the ghost shift's reality) is somewhat oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs when the figure turns and Elias chooses to stay and offer the object rather than flee.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (obsidian, river, swan, silence) that converge at closure when the keeper releases the new book and returns to witness-mode. Orientation anchors (catacombs, obsidian refuge, the keeper's role) arrive clearly within the first third. The closure reads as Earned Stasis: she chooses continued witness-stance over intervention, and "the world could regenerate in peace" reweights her passivity as purposeful restraint. However, the cost of this refusal is asserted more than dramatized—no live alternative or foreclosed path is made legible enough to charge the final image with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative structure: keepsake mystery → creek encounter → eclipse gathering. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the curl becomes "a beginning, not a question"), but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no specific option is visibly forfeited on the page. The lens holds (Accumulative/Textural), and the final image reweights the curl's meaning, but the pressure never tightens into a live trade-off. Orientation is clear early (Sage Ridge, Elias, cottage), so no penalty there.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered images (tapestry, diaries, silo hum) that converge at closure when the dragons "lift their heads" and the axis reveals itself as directional rather than broken. Orientation anchors (silo, Elara, "two winters ago") arrive early. The closure—"It was a door"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise (displaced axis) with the cost legible in Elara's realization that the past she chased was always pointing elsewhere, foreclosing her prior method. One meaningful deepening (from collector to participant) tightens the final image, meeting the length's requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal (Elias finds clue → decodes microdot → woman arrives with demand). Orientation anchors arrive late: lighthouse job motive unclear until the fortune cookie, and the 1987 storm reference feels like a convenient clue rather than earned causality. The closure unit—Elias agreeing to "play" the new key—reads as Charged Poise, but the cost is asserted ("orchestrated this") rather than shown; we don't see what Elias forfeits or risks by handing over the specs. The "originals" twist arrives unearned (no prior signal that multiples exist), weakening causal linkage at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we learn "dimensional anchor" and "loop pedal priest" but not who/where/when clearly by ~120 words, though the disorientation doesn't serve closure and waives penalty given the pattern teaches a ritual frame. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (sound layering, violet spreading, stillness "revealed"), and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the revelation without a decisive physical act. Cost is implied ("the violet had spread") but remains conceptual rather than felt; pointing to "for the first time, he saw what it had been hiding" doesn't specify what was lost or foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs (the violet burn transitions to clarity), satisfying the length requirement, but the cost legibility is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (glass spire, frozen lake, Liora at dawn). The structure is a mosaic of four numbered memories interleaved with present-moment beats; the pattern is legible and transitions are clear. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—hearing symphonies in silence, horizon cracking—crystallizes her shift from passive mirror-gazing to active remembering. However, the cost is not legible on the page; the "crack" is metaphorical without a visible forfeiture or tactical consequence, dropping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early (Elias, viaduct) but "when" remains vague throughout; the storm-cleared sky and rain bookend offer atmosphere without a time-window that tightens decisions. The closure unit—letting go of the door, labyrinth collapse, return to viaduct—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization), but the cost is told ("he didn't feel fractured… felt whole") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or image that makes the price undeniable. Drive lens is Hybrid (causal tablet-touch triggers the labyrinth; accumulative visions and echoes; situational pressure from other selves), coherent through the middle but the ending summarizes the shift rather than landing it via a decisive image or action. The "way out" line offers conceptual closure but the felt cost required by the rubric is missing from the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors orientation cleanly (drum maker's cavern, Elias and Mira, months of study) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through backstory fragments (broken needle, Mira's screaming into void) and culminates in the drum tap that gives silence shape. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Mira closes her eyes, lets emptiness in, and the numbness reweights into "something she could hold"—but the cost remains implied rather than undeniably visible on the page. The final paragraph ("The filament of hush had woven itself into something new") leans toward abstract summary, softening the closure beat's sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a Causal lens with clear anchoring (who/where/when by the second paragraph) and maintains it through the message discovery and Elias's decision to investigate. The closure moment—Elias turning toward the eastern quarter with the promise that "integrity demanded more than observation"—reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing options with pressure felt on the page. The cost is primarily conceptual (leaving solitude for action) rather than viscerally embodied, and the mechanical rhythm mentioned late arrives without prior setup, creating a minor causality slip in what triggers his final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored early (grotto, Lirien, starlight, energy beings' altered world) and the accumulative lens is signaled through "uncovering layers" and the texture-of-time quest. The rope functions as a key; pulling it triggers the light-eruption and time-layer vision, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the texture revealed as "alive"). Cost is present but oblique: the stars blink out then return brighter, and the rope goes limp—consequences that suggest transformation without legible forfeiture. The middle deepens (prisoner's echo, rope tightening/slackening) but escalation reads more as accretion than causal tightening. Lens holds at closure but cost clarity could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchors (greenhouse, shipwrecks, water). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush shifts from "absence" to "anticipation"), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than materially visible—no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sound accumulates until the hum answers, then the final paragraph reconfigures the silence. However, the "anticipation" shift is told, not shown through a concrete image or action that makes the price undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (amber grotto, dusk, Liora and Darian) and the petal transaction provides a visible event. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—Liora watches Darian leave and prepares to continue the cycle—but the cost is more stated ("some lies were kinder") than shown through a forfeited option or altered tactic on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere and the petal's static build meaning), yet the ending recycles the opening mood without a decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The "Same time next week?" exchange confirms repetition rather than transformation, and while the spent petal's dullness is noted, no new constraint or visible price changes Liora's stance in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph) and the drive lens reads as Causal with an Accumulative accent (the envelope mistake → meeting Mara → fund proposal). The closure attempts a Decisive Change (Elias commits to the fund) but the cost remains abstract—no on-page price paid or path foreclosed. The fund initiation is declared, not dramatized with a trade-off or visible consequence. The sequence is coherent but the ending lacks the felt weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around the search for Veyra's tag and moves through search → discovery → acceptance, with the arbor's transformation serving as the closure image that reweights Liora's isolation. Orientation anchors late (~150 words for spatial clarity). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: Liora's hand appears as a new line, signaling graft-into-community), and cost is legible in the sculpture's disappearance and her "luminescent ache." One meaningful deepening when the tag is found and the arbor blazes, narrowing her path from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors quickly (Veyth, rooftops, Liora) and follows a single continuous descent toward the hourglass chamber. The closure image—"time bent around her"—offers a visual endpoint but lacks legible cost; we see light, not consequence or foreclosed options. The piece reads Causal in intent (following echoes → finding the chamber → turning the hourglass) but the final beat dissolves into abstraction rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page stakes. Cost is asserted ("uncaged the moment") but not dramatized in body, choice, or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the orchard exhales, the glass eyes glow, sensations layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—Elias accepts his sister is "not gone, not entirely"). The closure reweights the opening silence from empty to "full." Cost is felt but oblique: he does not recover his sister, and the final acceptance forecloses further active search. Orientation anchors (cavern orchard, Elias, nighttime conjuring) arrive within the first ~100 words and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the orchard "answers" and he "understood then," shifting his stance from searcher to acceptor.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure mounts through the outage window and Elias's discovery work, with closure attempting Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece tracks causally through discovery → hiding the tape → Mara's arrival, but the final beat stops at suspended options rather than reconfiguring them with felt cost on the page. The story teaches us Elias *could* step forward, but he closes his eyes—a micro-turn of refusal without visible consequence or a reweighted image that charges prior material. Cost remains potential rather than undeniable in the closure lines.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (nursery, storm season, sapling distress). The closure unit—Mara kneeling and surrendering control as the sapling transforms—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharply legible on the page: no concrete forfeiture of her pruning tools, no explicit choice to abandon a specific cultivation method. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density increases through discovery → transformation → surrender), yet the final image feels more like mood confirmation than a reweighting that narrows options or deepens stakes with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; causality holds through dream→brooch→cave→woman as a clean because/therefore chain. The closure unit reads as Charged Poise: the painter takes her hand as the tide swallows the paths, crystallizing the choice to submerge into her memory-burden with the brooch burning between them. Cost is implied but legible: he accepts being "pulled under" rather than continuing his solitary scraping at canvases. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cave paintings reveal the woman's trapped presence, narrowing his options toward convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The causal chain holds through the pilgrim's arrival and the pearl manipulation, but the climax pivots on convenience: the pearl cracks and shadows "surge forward" without Elias's decision shaping that outcome. Closure reads as Decisive Change (pilgrim swallowed, pearl gone), yet the cost is told ("he hadn't understood its price") rather than shown through a trade-off Elias makes on the page. The lens oscillates between causal (pilgrim acts) and accumulative (music deepens) without a dominant frame clarified by midpoint, weakening the closure's legibility under one consistent drive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: Liora seeks valves → finds second → retrieves third → discovers map/truth. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—"They erased us" realization plus the decision to "sound the truth"—delivers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the city's historical erasure is now undeniable). One meaningful tightening occurs when all three valves reveal the map. The ending feels slightly abstract; "sound the truth" remains a promise rather than an on-page act with visible consequence, which prevents entry into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal progression: ticket punch arrives → arrows guide → manhole opens → tunnel reveals jars → conductor appears → choice crystallizes. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias takes the woman's hand, the tunnel trembles, and the train whistle signals imminent transformation with felt cost (he's stepping beyond the known). The lens reads Causal with strong because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman declares "not too late" and offers her hand, narrowing options to a binary with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (tile symbols, whale songs, entangled memories) and culminates in a cadence shift when Elias transcribes the stories, reweighting his stance from skeptic to believer. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): he accepts the tower's magic and commits to memory-keeping. Cost is felt—his skepticism is forfeited, his worldview altered—but the exact price (what he loses by staying, what he sacrifices to return) remains somewhat abstract rather than sharply legible in a single on-page moment. The whale migration provides a time-bound pressure frame, yet its constraint on Elias's choices is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when by the second paragraph; no orientation penalty applies. The closure unit—Veyra alone with the cold fragment, realizing "after goodbye, there was only silence"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance/Earned Stasis), but the cost remains asserted rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. Kael's vanishing and the storm's sudden quieting feel coincidental rather than motivated by Veyra's palm-slam action, weakening causal linkage at the climax. The lens reads Causal with Situational pressure (dimensional storm as crucible), but the final beat does not demonstrably narrow options or show what path she foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (prep room, Elias, night) land by ~80 words, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Situational: the woman's arrival forces Elias to crystallize his stance on the ink pot, and his final offer ("by waiting actively") reweights the situation without a decisive plot turn. The closure is a Charged Poise—options are made legible, pressure is undeniable, but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page. The ink pot's mechanics (fractal patterns, equations) are described but not causally linked to Elias's choice; he decides based on the woman's bruises and plea, not the pot's demonstrated power. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman names the pot, narrowing Elias's options.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers descriptive particulars (bonsai, lamp hum, notepad pages, town silence) toward a final image of resonance, but the closure unit lacks visible cost—the stationer feels "at peace" and hears a train whistle without forfeiting a live option or facing friction. The mysterious handwriting and lamp hum suggest stakes around connection to past lives, yet no before/after is legible: he writes, feels peace, the story ends. Orientation is clear early (mountaintop, dawn, empty shop), and the two-shard structure (shop backstory, mountaintop present) is legible, but the ending image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established cleanly (port, containers, post-death-certificate). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered images (graffiti, mudflats, scratched names) and the final Daniel Mercer callback reweights the opening premise. However, the closure unit—"Maybe some histories weren't meant to be found—only layered"—leans toward abstract moralizing rather than an on-page image with felt cost; the protagonist's stance crystallizes through reflection more than dramatized choice. The lack of a visible forfeit or cost-bearing action at the ending beat keeps this mid-band despite the coherent accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the seashell, cello, and visions layer to reweight Elias's understanding. Orientation is prompt (abandoned observatory, Elias, present-day) by the opening. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—"the myth had reimagined him"—but the cost remains abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed on the page. The vision sequences function as exposition rather than causal pressure that narrows choices. One meaningful deepening occurs (seashell hum → cello discovery → final realization), but the final image asserts transformation without showing what Elias sacrifices or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The closure moment—Lan believing for the first time that "the raft survives because we choose it"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The privatization vote looms as a deadline, yet the night-before timing doesn't narrow her options or force a painful choice; Old Man Vey's appearance feels like external validation rather than a decision she earns through prior causality. The inferred lens is Situational with Causal elements, but the final beat doesn't deliver the felt price the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean: Elias on Mons Huygens, photographing the last undisturbed crater. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—details accrue (sand grain, cobalt strip, camera click) and the final image reweights the opening stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that the moment won't last), but the cost is told rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift makes the acceptance palpable beyond the philosophical gloss in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elias repairs the drone → releases it → it returns with decoded feedback, confirming his method. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: his trust in unseen feedback is validated), but the cost is thin—no path is foreclosed, no sacrifice made. The feedback "clear now" resolves too smoothly without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ice-memory motifs, condensation patterns, and phrasebook fragments layer toward a final convergence image. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. However, the closure unit—Mira's request to go to the lake's center—lands as Charged Poise at best, with the cost implied rather than felt on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift occurs in the final beat. The "or where the ice remembers" echo and the falcon's return suggest reweighting, but the before/after remains conceptual rather than dramatized with a legible price. The two-shard structure (indoor atlas work, dawn conversation) coheres, yet the final turn hinges on a phrasebook callback without a fresh pressure point that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (cryptic tuner, Hollow's End, dusk arrival, archway) land within the first ~100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rhythmic intensification across seven days builds density and pressure until the final shimmer of light reconfigures the town's state with cost (the tuner's departure, the town "listening" rather than restored). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the tuner completes his ritual and leaves, foreclosing keeper status) with conceptual cost legible in "not restored, not truly." One meaningful deepening—day three's *click-click* breakthrough—tightens the pattern. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Lira, submersible, temple approach). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the gathered hush deepens through sensory layers (silence, incense taste, memory fragments) and the vial's uncorking provides a decisive tightening that reweights the premise. Closure lands on the page—the diver dissolves, the hush shifts from oppressive to vast, Lira turns to leave—with felt cost (the vial emptied, connection to her mother spent). The causal link between offering the perfume and sating the hush is economically earned, though the mechanics of "unsnarl… with instinct" remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring "hush," the lattice, and copperlight imagery build density. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias speaks his name, the lattice shatters, the lighthouse beam flickers, and he runs—a crystallized moment that reweights silence versus testimony. Cost is felt (he must keep running, "some silences were meant to be broken") but remains somewhat abstract. The ledger discovery and the hovering shape provide beats, but causality is loose—why does speaking his name repel Hush?—and the mechanics of the confessional's role are told rather than dramatized, weakening on-page cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora accepts the burden of remembering, and the debt is repaid with visible emotional cost ("the wound remained—lovingly venomous, forever open"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (bead, bride, blood-stained memory) and the final cadence shift reweights the debt's nature. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (greenhouse, Liora, winter solstice ritual), waiving the penalty. Minor causality slip: the vision of "another life" arrives without clear on-page trigger beyond holding the bead, which borders on convenient revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (Liora), where (labyrinth), and when (after tide pools emptied) by the opening paragraph. The closure—Liora weaving at the loom and integrating into the labyrinth's story—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt; the overlapping footprints vanish without consequence, and her smile suggests resolution without friction. The causal chain (footprints → needle → loom) is legible but the needle's appearance feels serendipitous rather than motivated by prior agency. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the loom, yet the escalation lacks a clear foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (Varethis harbor, Necropolis Hills, catacomb orchard entrance) land early. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: discovery montage → central chamber → light/woman manifestation → roots bloom. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the woman's appearance and the blooming bones, but the cost remains abstract ("weight of twenty years lift"); no on-page forfeiture or trade-off is legible in the final image. The sundial placement triggers transformation, but the protagonist's agency in that moment is passive receipt rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The drive lens reads as Causal with puzzle-solving steps leading to the mother encounter, but the closure cost is implied rather than legible—what path has been foreclosed, what price paid? The story ends on recognition and a thematic statement ("searching for his own [name]") without showing the before/after shift in options or stance. The mother's arrival feels coincidental rather than causally earned by Elias's choices; her presence depends on her leaving the clues, making Elias a decoder rather than an agent whose decisions narrow his options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraphs and moves through a clear causal sequence: noticing discrepancies → tracing the hidden message → spreading fragments → coup challenged. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Liora watches the stars with the conspiracy unraveling, but the cost remains abstract—we don't see what she personally forfeited or how her stance was reconfigured with felt consequence. The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative elements; it holds but the ending image doesn't crystallize a sharp before/after with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: spirits' voices, condensation messages, shard warmth, and the apparition build density toward the final moment when Liora speaks aloud and pockets the shard. Orientation anchors (mangrove boardwalk, evening, Liora alone with shard and letter) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the apology remains unsent but "no longer felt like a failure…like the first step," reweighting her stance. Cost is implied—she defers the letter again—but the final image ("The letter could wait") undercuts urgency, making the cost feel more aspirational than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by ~100 words and uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: the coral fragments pulse in unison, the cast-notes align, and the final word "Home" reweights prior anxieties. The Orientation Test is met, and the ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the atrium becomes a bridge, fear unknots into connection). However, the cost remains conceptual—no tactical option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no social price paid on the page. The midpoint Dr. Voss coordinates emerge but never influence a choice, weakening causal linkage even under an accumulative design. The closure image is charged but the price is felt only as "lotus-hearted ache," not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story demonstrates Accumulative/Textural logic: fog, fresco fragment, and light-painting coalesce toward a final image where the print "gives back its joy." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the apple now held, not reaching), and cost registers as Liora's years-long search resolving and "the weight in her chest lifting." Orientation is clear by the opening lines. One structural concern: the developed photograph showing the child *holding* the apple—a reversal not dramatized as discovery but presented as fait accompli—slightly undercuts causal transparency, though the accumulative mode tolerates this.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is anchored (Elias on scaffold, cathedral, sound garden outside) and the piece follows an accumulative lens: awakenings one through four deepen the supernatural threat. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias understands the mural is a door and has been asked to step through—but the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift accompanies the final beat. The "four awakenings" structure provides a taught pattern, but the final image ("he had just been asked to step through") does not crystallize a visible price or tactical foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Situational elements (the regime pressure forces stance crystallization). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat. The closure—Elias reaching for the map and the warping messages spreading—shows a Decisive Change with agency, but the cost remains somewhat abstract ("By the time the tax collectors noticed, it was too late" summarizes rather than dramatizes consequences). The escalation from resistance to commitment is legible, though the inspector's departure removes pressure rather than compounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through sensory density and spiraling imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet finally writing after 73 days, the postcard's edges softening from singed to forgiving). Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The closure shows Elias filling three pages with visible cost (tears, exhaustion), and the final image of lullabies drifting "across centuries" reweights the opening longing with undeniable emotional pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shell's projections shift from ocean memory to his fractured face, then back to dancing with his pen—this tightens the dominant stake (grief into beauty) and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonance through layered imagery (orchids, names, sound) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora realizes she's "giving them a place to live again"—a conceptual repricing of her caretaking as active preservation. Cost is present but muted: the "foxglove regret" softens rather than being paid in a visible forfeiture. The closure reweights prior material cleanly, though the final emotional shift feels asserted more than earned through a decisive struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archive opens, silence shifts from oppressive to expectant, and Elara begins writing with "the ink well's essence" lingering—options and stakes are crystallized with felt cost (the shattered ink well, isolation, uncertain path ahead). The causal lens holds: her decipherment → speaking the symphony → ink well shatters → voices answer → archive opens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the voice demands she "listen or turn away," forcing her final commitment. Orientation is swift (who, where, what within opening lines). Minor deduction: the Velyrian backstory and the curators' buried truth add texture but don't directly shape Elara's tactical choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the chain, envelope, and adhesive accumulate into a pattern that reweights Mira's understanding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance shifts from betrayal to continuation—but the cost is asserted ("past and present were no longer at war") rather than made visible in a forfeited option or tactical shift. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The letter's reveal provides the tightening, though it arrives via discovery rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust motes, paper trails, and recurring objects (meteorite, ledger, lyric sheet) build density toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (attic, Elias, three months) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias crystallizes his choice to stay and "help piece it together," foregrounding cost (end of running, acceptance of collaboration) with the pigeon cooing as a charged echo of his courier identity. One meaningful deepening when Lena produces the lyric sheet. Cost is present but could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring images (prism, grain, weather code) and the final moment—Elias setting the prism down and walking away—reconfigures his stance via Earned Stasis with felt cost (accepting her choice to vanish). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (terrace, Elias, sunset). However, causality remains thin: the weather code "47-19-3" and grain analysis generate no on-page discoveries or tactical shifts; Elias's walk-away is prompted by internal epiphany rather than scene pressure. Cost is conceptual (letting go) but not viscerally dramatized in a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately and tracks a single investigation arc from feather discovery to chamber reveal. Closure offers a Charged Poise moment—Elias hesitates, the passage closes, he leaves with a "silent promise"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible as a foreclosed path. The "until sunrise" urgency is declared but never tightens tactics on the page; automated sealing happens off-screen without altering choices. Causal lens holds through most beats, but the final decision (to follow Liora) bypasses the established want (to belong) without visible friction or price.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the piece gathers images and reflections toward a thematic reweighting). Orientation is clean. The closure—Liora deciding "some pieces were meant to stay missing"—reads as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her premise. However, the cost is asserted in summary ("that, she decided, was all right") rather than made legible through a forfeited action or visible consequence on the page. The seed discovery feels ornamental rather than a pressure point that alters her stance, softening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within opening lines (Lira, arcade, between acts). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the choreographed spontaneity, culminating in the shared performance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the moment of connection and the promise to return—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; nothing tangible is foreclosed. The tossed bishop suggests renunciation, but what Lira loses or risks by orchestrating this moment remains unclear, weakening the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Situational lens: the nostalgia ban creates coherent pressure, and Liora's acceptance of the tattooist crystallizes her stance with visible cost (criminal status, shared exile). The closure is a Charged Poise—she moves from solitary refusal to companionship, and the wind carrying "salt and distant storms" reconfigures her isolation into chosen defiance. Orientation anchors smoothly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). One weakness: the man's arrival and immediate high-stakes proposal compress causality; a beat showing his observation or her reputation would tighten motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, Pearl Bay, dawn) appear promptly. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds through mist, prism light, ripples, and ledgers toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final image. However, the closure lacks legible cost—Elias "understands" but no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made visible. The old woman's stone-throw and the water-vision feel like a reveal rather than a tightening earned by prior pressure, weakening the closure's felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the ridge path opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: moonlight → box → note → stranger → shared storytelling deepens pressure through accretion. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "rewriting the bargain," but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or concrete shift in options. The pen-and-notebook moment gestures toward healing but does not crystallize what Elias or the stranger loses or gains in that exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (shells → patterns → gauge movement), and the piece teaches this pattern early. However, closure relies on a declared understanding ("the gauge wasn't just a relic. It was a bridge") without on-page cost or a before/after that forecloses a path. The needle's movement and her smile offer Charged Poise potential, but the final lines assert thematic conclusion rather than dramatizing a felt price. Orientation is clear. The two-shard structure (finding the gauge; arranging shells; the gauge activates) fits mosaic allowances, but the ending substitutes exposition for closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains single POV through one continuous passage exploration. Drive lens reads as Situational-Causal hybrid: the ivy passage and diaries create pressure, the woman's appearance crystallizes stakes, and the map on the floor offers a charged final image. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias poised over the map with walls humming in anticipation—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt in a decision or renunciation. The woman's "You're late" and the map's living veins reweight the premise, yet the final beat stops at threshold rather than crossing with visible consequence, leaving the reconfiguration more conceptual than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (prism, lullabies, mirage) and a cadence shift at the bells signals closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Liora moves from doubt to belief as the mirage "sharpens into something almost real"—but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. Orientation anchors (terrace, Liora, twilight) arrive early and hold cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization toward shared burden), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically legible—what specific option does Liora foreclose by agreeing? The piece teaches a hybrid lens (reflective accumulation toward a causal turn) but the final image relies on atmospheric cues (monks chanting, alignment complete) rather than a concrete action or renunciation that reweights prior pressure. Kessar's coin and the treaty's singed edges function as motifs without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure unit is legible: Elias releases the drought and leaves the egg as monument, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where he forecloses further intervention. However, the decision arrives without meaningful on-page pressure or reversal; the dams open via phone tap with no dramatized cost or friction. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in design, but the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp cadence shift or pattern break that would charge the image with undeniable weight. Orientation is clear early; no penalty applied there.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Liora moves through spatial thresholds (courtyard → sanctuary entrance → chamber) gathering symbolic cargo (echoes). However, no meaningful tightening occurs—each thread simply releases when she recalls the right memory, and the sanctuary opens without resistance or cost. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("she had found her voice") but the before/after remains conceptual; no on-page choice forecloses a live option or alters her situation with felt consequence. The echoes she harvests never constrain a subsequent decision.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early (acceptable). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, candle ritual, and storytelling without causal because/therefore linkage. Closure unit is ambiguous—the candle gutters then returns, Liora smiles, declares "the work was just beginning." No decisive change, no visible cost, no felt price that reconfigures prior material; reads as a setup rather than a resonant reconfiguration. Cost proof test fails: cannot point to an exact sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression, building density through the grotto setting and monarch arrival. Orientation anchors (grotto above clouds, Liora's solitary presence) arrive early. However, closure lacks on-page cost: Liora's departure and the fallen stones are asserted in summary ("The stones would fall") rather than shown as a felt loss or transformation. The final image reweights the signals as ephemeral, but no decisive change or visible price lands on the page to satisfy RR or CR with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening lines) and the accumulative lens holds: Elias moves from kneeling with the frayed rope through transcription to the final coiling, each beat adding density. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he chooses to preserve forgotten names with felt cost ("given their names a place to live, if only for a moment")—and the aurora's final shimmer charges the image. However, the stakes remain abstract throughout; no live obstacle or reversal tests his commitment, which keeps the tightening modest.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (bunker, Elias, storm approach) arrive early. The wafer seal → dream → forest path → hidden door sequence accumulates imagery but lacks a causal tightening that narrows options. Closure relies on the woman's exposition ("You choose it, again and again") and a key prop (the key) that melts into existence without prior setup, undermining earned causality. The final image ("the key warm in his palm") offers Charged Poise but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when); the timeframe "between regimes" is signaled and used to justify the astronomer's window of access. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens tilting Accumulative/Situational: the tile's glow, the figure's appearance, and the star-mirror build pressure through intensifying images rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the astronomer clutching clay while the mercenaries arrive crystallizes his success—knowledge preserved—against the collapsing regime, with cost implied (he may be captured, the tile is now "unremarkable"). The cost is felt but oblique; pointing to "hands clutching a single, unremarkable shard" as the proof moment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established by ~100 words (sanctuary, music box, Elara). The drive lens oscillates between Causal (pin reappears, cellular memory triggers Veyra's recall) and Accumulative/Textural (sanctuary magic, shifting walls), never fully committing to either. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (release of resentment), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing accompanies the "weight lift." The sanctuary's convenient magic resolves obstacles (broken pin reappears whole, cellular memory solves the persuasion challenge) without the protagonist's agency driving the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph (mirror maker, ruined orchard, foggy twilight). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the sextant's hum triggers the fog-walk, the glass mountain materializes, and the dream's capture resolves through a Resonant Reconfiguration (trust replaces possession, the sextant mends). Closure cost is conceptual—the mountain dissolves, the orchard's bones remain—but the felt price to the protagonist is oblique; he smiles without visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening (the climb and the dream's trembling vulnerability) suffices for this length, though causal linkage between the sextant's pulse and the mountain's appearance is more associative than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors WHO (Liora, quartz-eye mender), WHERE (cathedral orchard), and WHEN (after breach of contract) within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered image (ribbon, pendant fracture, orchard vows) and converges at closure when Liora's repair wisdom lands in the peach-exchange beat, reweighting "persist" with quiet cost (she accepts the gift, internalizing the lesson she taught). The RR is Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes mutual care and the decision to "let things grow" with felt pressure. Cost is oblique but legible: both carry fractured keepsakes forward.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the orchard's strangeness, the shell's blankness, and the curator's inquiry deepen through layered reflection until the bath scene crystallizes a Conceptual Repricing—the shell as vessel for nonlinear inheritance reweights the premise. Orientation anchors arrive late (gallery/asteroid/orchard locations clarify only after several paragraphs), triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit (realization that the shell is "waiting" and the orchard is a "ledger of possibilities") lands with conceptual cost (pursuit replaces ownership, bewilderment becomes awe), but the cost remains more told than shown in a decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered images, shifting shelves, the diary as breadcrumb). Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. Closure unit: the sister's appearance and Elara's realization ("Some lessons...never meant to be learned alone") functions as Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The "library of unlearned lessons" premise is seeded early but resolved by arrival, not by a choice that narrows options. One meaningful deepening (renegotiation, door-opening) is present, but the final image lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraph, avoiding orientation debt. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: memory fragments and sensory images layer toward the garden revelation. However, closure lacks decisive cost—Elias accepts Liora's pronouncement and both are "swallowed" by fog without an on-page choice, forfeiture, or stance crystallization that reconfigures his prior search. The ending image ("Some solace isn't meant to be kindled") functions as thematic assertion rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. No meaningful tightening narrows options in the second half; the carousel memory and tarot card are decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors appear late (~180 words to establish she's an archivist in the mechanism room). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she will archive the truth), but the cost remains abstract—"some absences were meant to be filled" tells rather than showing what path she forecloses. The causal lens mostly holds, but the vision sequence operates more as exposition than a dramatized turn that narrows her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, stakes by the opening paragraph). The piece operates under a Causal lens: Ryn's search → stone vibration → light conjuring → bloom discovery → binding attempt → collapse and escape form a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she carries the silence in the stone, sharing it rather than inhabiting it, with the bloom's collapse as visible cost. The final image ("she had found a way to carry it") reweights her goal with felt opportunity cost (the bloom is destroyed). One meaningful tightening (beings' awareness pressing against the bloom) narrows options and forces the binding choice. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: custodian, pavilion, salt flats, post-collapse timeline established early. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure gathers through layered images (grandmother's touch, prism discovery, star-path charting) toward a moment of charged poise when the beacon pulses gold. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final walk reconfigures Elias's stance from passive custodian to active seeker, crystallizing the pivot with undeniable forward pressure. Cost is felt (abandoning the pavilion "wouldn't be back") but not deeply foregrounded; the cost of leaving versus staying lacks on-page friction or trade-off dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through deepening atmospheric detail and recursive meditation on memory and shadow. Orientation anchors arrive late—who Elara is and why she's examining monuments emerges only after extended mood-setting—but the effect is purposeful and the pattern coheres. The closure reconfigures the observatory from puzzle to echo-chamber and repositions the fog bridge as a backward path, which carries conceptual weight. However, the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; we're told she'll "see what they were hiding," but no visible forfeiture or tactical shift crystallizes the price of this stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (blooming fortress at dusk, Liora, kerosene rag). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers images (mosaic note, shadow-etched figures, blooming petals) and culminates in a cadence shift that reweights the premise from "bring light" to "remember." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image reconfigures the mission's meaning—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page. The phrase "she had brought light, but the light had given her something in return" restates theme rather than showing the foreclosed path or price paid, leaving the closure unit legible but not viscerally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (grotto, tidal pool, Liora). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the cicada's handling, the dream-memory, and the sinking moment, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cicada as key, the door in the silence she left behind). The closure reweights prior material with conceptual cost—she must return to the unfinished conversation—but the felt price is muted. One meaningful deepening (the cicada sinking, the face beneath) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: gravity inverts, the trellis appears, Liora climbs despite her father's prohibition. Orientation anchors (bunker child, inverted world, trellis) arrive early. The encounter with the boy and the doll exchange deepen her stance, and the final "next time" nod crystallizes her resolve to return—a Charged Poise moment where options are reconfigured. Cost is implied (she will endure the bunker knowing escape exists) but not viscerally demonstrated on the page; pointing to a specific sentence where the price lands is difficult, triggering a moderate deduction per the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density (prism light, water sounds, the storm glass's shifting states) and converges in the woman's moment of release when she finally writes. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—her shoulders relax, pen moves, notebook is tucked away with visible relief—and the cost is legible in the prior tension and the train whistle's return marking passage. Orientation anchors (gondola, terrace, night) arrive early. One meaningful deepening (Elias's directive "Listen" followed by stillness) tightens options and the final image ("storm glass...in approval") reweights the opening hum with conceptual cost: silence achieved through surrender, not force.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate—waterfall, grove, mural, staircase, throne—toward a final image of dawn and inheritance. However, closure lacks visible cost; Veyra sits, the chamber trembles, murals flare, and she opens her eyes to a new era without forfeiting anything on the page or facing a choice that narrows options. The piece delivers a declarative ending ("the throne had an heir") rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change with felt cost. The phrase "until sunrise to decide" appears only in the final paragraph, creating a post-hoc ticking clock rather than shaping prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—the touch steadies breath and reweights the keeper's long refusal with visible cost. The knocking sequence builds density and the scar-link provides causal pressure. One structural seam: the child's arrival feels convenient (no prior signal of this specific visitor), and the phrase "teach suffocating to breathe" lands as prompt echo rather than earned discovery. Closure is legible and the lens holds, but the convenience and late thematic articulation prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (farm, volunteer, bolt by line three). The porthole turn provides a reversal, and Elias's choice to collapse the void rather than step through gestures toward Earned Stasis. However, the cost remains abstract—"something had shifted" tells rather than shows the forfeited path—and the ending pivot to pyramid-scheme education reads as summary rather than on-page consequence. Lens is Causal-leaning Hybrid; closure RR is present but cost legibility is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (who, where, when) within the first paragraph and employs a Causal lens: Elias's turn of the crank handle triggers the standing-wave revelation. However, the closure is primarily a knowledge gain (learning about the Council of Erasure) without a decisive on-page change or felt cost that reconfigures his options. The specter's warning ("bridges can be burned") hints at stakes but does not land as a legible price paid or path foreclosed in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, Aldric, post-war). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens with layered imagery (orchard, program, marionettes, strings), but closure relies on Aldric's passive acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The program dissolves into embers and the marionettes surge—events happen *to* him. Cost is asserted ("he did not resist") but the before/after in his agency or stance is not legible on the page; the final line offers theme statement rather than felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: button discovery → boarding house visit → postcard reveal → note-writing closure. The final act (writing the note) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Elias reweights his archival mission with visible emotional cost ("no longer felt like a burden"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One notable slip: the landlady's drawer-postcard feels convenient—no prior signal that she kept correspondence or that Daniel would have written to her—but does not break causality outright.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers a Causal lens: key → tunnel → console → broadcast → enforcer hesitation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs (Lira, auric lagoon, post-coup present). The closure unit is a Decisive Change: the broadcast cracks the regime's narrative monopoly, and Lira's smile + forward step reconfigure her from drifter to catalyst. Cost is visible in the enforcers' presence and the implication of capture, though the exact price (death, imprisonment) remains off-page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the upload succeeds and the world "holds its breath."

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, prophecy fragments, and musical imagery toward a final cadence shift where the mist lifts and the city wakes "oblivious." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the prophecy is "quiet" with visible cost (lighter case, faintest hum). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias understands he must "play it back" to absorb the words, tightening the stakes. Cost is legible in the final image ("the only trace…a held breath finally released"), satisfying the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase via moonstone dust proliferation and leaf-pattern recognition). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora becomes "part of the folklore" and continues sorting, but the cost is decorative—no path is foreclosed on the page, no live option visibly sacrificed. The final image recycles the opening (sorting) without reweighting stakes, and the villagers' whispered claim of transformation is told rather than dramatized with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~120 words. The drive lens reads Situational: Elias pursues the compass rose's pull through escalating environments (workshop → greenhouse → cavern → clockwork city), and coincidence complicates rather than resolves. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the clock hums to life, the city's rhythm falters, and Elias smiles—options are crystallized and pressure is undeniable. The felt cost, however, is oblique; no on-page sentence makes legible what Elias forfeits or risks by releasing the city's inhabitants. The causality from compass needle → waterfall → alternate city is motivated by situational pressure, but the final act (clock activation) lacks an explicit because/therefore link to prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The coin discovery → carved name → Elias revelation chain tightens options causally, and the final exchange ("pressed the coin into his palm") closes with felt cost—Liora accepts fracture as design. One meaningful deepening is achieved when the carved name reframes Elias's theft as confession rather than betrayal. Closure lands on the page, though the cost remains somewhat implicit rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: the woman's departure and the collector's receipt of "laughter, pure and untainted" constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights his quest with felt cost (centuries of emptiness ending, her dissolution into light). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (collector, gorge, pre-dawn, soul-gathering context). The causality is poetic rather than mechanical—his presence and listening enable her memory—which fits the accumulative design. One meaningful deepening occurs when she laughs and offers the note, transforming his burden into warmth. Cost is legible: she vanishes, he moves forward altered.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraphs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: ultraviolet imagery and mathematical motifs build toward a conceptual repricing. However, the closure relies on the stranger's exposition ("Here it is") and the vial's immediate revelation rather than protagonist-driven causality. The final image reweights the premise ("knowing when to stop"), qualifying as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical alteration is legible in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece pools images (fragment, market, painting, locket) and the ending reweights "the searching was the honoring" without requiring a decisive turn. Orientation is solid by line two. However, closure lacks felt cost—Liora's stance crystallizes into acceptance without foreclosing a live option or paying a price on the page; the final smile and "keep searching" read as affirmation rather than a reconfiguration with pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the work is retrieval, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fracture seals, ghosts sleep, Mira's burden lifts but her vigilance continues) with visible cost—she remains bound to her watchful role. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust layers, the mainspring's mysterious presence, and sensory details (sawdust, caramel corn) build density that the final image reweights. Orientation anchors (ticket office, elevator Car 3, after hours) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira theorizes "time was leaking" and acts on it, narrowing her stance from observer to intervener.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals accumulative/textural intent through recurring glass/frost imagery, but causality remains vague: the whisper's mechanism and Elias's paper-placement logic are told rather than shown. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure effect—library dissolving into a single tree, whisper now silent—reads as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting "perfection as prison," but the cost is abstract; we see no visible forfeiture of relationship, capability, or concrete stake. The lens holds, yet the ending image lacks the sharp before/after that makes cost undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: the archaeological dispute frames pressure, the temporal storm supplies atmosphere, but the peak turn (Elias activating the mirrors with verse) arrives without prior causal setup—no earlier beat demonstrates this method or its mechanics. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "I gave them back their voice"), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically visible (we see exhaustion but not what Elias forfeited or risked to succeed). The reversal from dispute to mystical success bypasses on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors late: "Hollow Quarter" and "resonance chamber" lack spatial grounding until the stranger appears (~35% in). The closure—inserting the chip and hearing the melody—reads as Decisive Change, but the causal chain is fragile: the stranger's cryptic prompts do not narrow Elias's options; he simply "understood" and acted. The memory flashback interrupts momentum and does not alter present tactics. Lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid, with the ending leaning situational (tethering to truth), but linkage between prior beats and the final act is thin. Cost is asserted ("fractures within himself") but not dramatized on the page with a visible forfeiture or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure: the petrichor shifts from passive scent to "breath of the world waking up," and the vial "hummed...warm and alive" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the lagoon's claim). Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words. The causal chain from factory closure to earth's memory to the lagoon's call is legible, though the grandfather's transformation is asserted more than it constrains Elias's final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal mechanics wrapped in Accumulative/lyric texture) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias becomes "timewoven," integrated into the collective work, foreclosing his prior solitary path. The cost is present but soft—"he didn't know if he'd ever leave" implies forfeiture without dramatizing resistance or loss. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The archway→cavern→bridge sequence has causal linkage, but the middle section (meeting the ensemble, explaining timewoven alliances) stalls momentum with exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: images (postcards, flowers, stained glass) layer toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the pavilion opening; no penalty. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—darkness as illumination, thaw as beginning—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the protagonist adds a flower to her mural without a felt sacrifice or foreclosed option on the page. One tightening (postcards → cathedral → pavilion return) reweights the dominant question, meeting minimal escalation, but the final image does not impose a legible emotional or tactical price.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a causal chain (storm unearths letters → Elara decodes diary → visions guide her to lagoon → confrontation and escape), but the closure relies on coincidental timing (men arrive exactly when Elara retrieves ledgers) and the lagoon's deus-ex-machina swallowing of pursuers. The "truth was safe—for now" ending gestures toward stakes without delivering visible cost or a decisive change in Elara's options. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, waiving the Q2 penalty. The drive lens reads as Causal through most beats, but the ending's reliance on external force (lagoon swallows men) rather than protagonist choice weakens closure under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening). Lens reads Causal-hybrid: Elias tries physical methods → fails → shifts to mental experiment → "knows" the bottle contains the last wish → lets go → town revives. However, the causal chain weakens at closure: the because/therefore link between "letting the image go" and the town's sudden revival is asserted rather than earned through prior dramatized mechanics. The cost of his mental labor is implied but not legible on the page—no visible forfeiture, no tactical shift forced by exhaustion or insight. A Conceptual Repricing might be intended (unspoken longing reimagined as collective potential), but the final image of hammer-and-voices arrives as convenient miracle rather than consequence of prior pressure, undercutting closure validity under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (foghorn, orchard, pomegranate, wax cylinder) toward a final cadence shift. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias understands the silence as invitation and commits to "listen." Cost is implied (his old role is ending, new one beginning) but the before/after lacks on-page friction or visible forfeit. The orientation anchor is clear (Elias, rooftop orchard, post-foghorn silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the playback voice becomes "a chorus of whispers," but the protagonist does not make a choice that narrows options—he simply packs the phonograph and walks away smiling.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: the atrium's ice, the acorn cap, and the hatchling accumulate until the moment when the acorn cap warms and Liora sees the greenhouse vision, which reweights her stance from preservation to forward carry. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ending crystallizes a shift from icebound ending to beginning—with conceptual cost (she accepts the burden of vortex inheritance). The cost is felt but somewhat implied rather than sharply visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Veythari sanctuary, dawn, storm approaching) within the first ~100 words. The piece operates under a Causal lens: Liora's wire-swap decision creates the condition where only she can sound the alarm, her misjudgment (letting the rope slip) immediately produces consequence (the storm changing), and her recovery (pulling the rope) prevents disaster. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she returns to listening with visible cost ("she had been wrong") and the resolution earns Charged Poise: the storm will pass, and she will listen again, her stance crystallized by near-failure. The cost is felt in her acknowledgment and the trembling sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: decades of sweeping and polishing accumulate weight until the falling star reweights Elias's role, culminating in the morning return where the station "felt like a beginning." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (a shift from custodian to witness) with conceptual cost visible in the warm lantern glass that now "hummed with the memory of falling light." The two-part structure (evening event, morning return) is clean, but the causal chain between star-fall and transformation is more lyric than because/therefore, risking slight lens ambiguity. Orientation is established early; the who/where/when are clear by paragraph three.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph three (Elias, oasis, post-visibility era); the timeframe is inferred situational rather than causal-clock driven. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through gathering ghosts, the solid woman's arrival, and the box's opening, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he closes the box, releases the flower, accepts the lighter silence). The closure reweights "unspoken words" and "tangled covenant" with felt cost (the ghosts dissolve, his solitude shifts). One escalation point (woman ghost's insistence) narrows options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the line "lighter, as if the weight of the unspoken had been lifted" and the scattering gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~40% (fragment → key → dream → whole urn), and the final image of Elias writing tags offers a Conceptual Repricing: time as circle rather than line. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (emerald silo, Elias, autumn backdrop). However, the urn's spontaneous healing and the woman's identity shift feel like late rule changes rather than motivated discoveries—cost at closure is conceptual but not viscerally felt on the page. The causal chain from fragment to whole urn to role acceptance compresses understanding into dream-exposition rather than scene pressure, weakening the tightening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through image (feather, woven dawns, the water) and deepens from grief-tending to hope-recovery. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira begins writing, reweighting her grief into creative possibility, and the final image ("even broken things could sing") charges prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt (she accepts incompleteness) but remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible price that alters tactics. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening is present.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece orients quickly (caretaker, temple orchard, terminal illness, developers arriving in a week) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias's systematic remodeling deepens across the afternoon, and the final image—animals eating from his palm, trees and stone remembering—reconfigures the orchard's persistence beyond his life. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wire work and animal trust crystallize his defiance with felt cost (his limited time, the developers' inevitable arrival). One mild seam: the botanical diary is described but never used, weakening early setup slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the pilgrimage reweights from spiritual to chemical via the amber's placement in the mortar and the glowing dust, charging the premise with undeniable pressure. The orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored early), and the convergence at the tower deepens understanding. Minor deduction: the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; Elias's skepticism "dissolves" without visible forfeiture or friction that forecloses a tangible path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and recurring images (jetty, seed pods, dead languages, battlefield) build toward a final image of patience and reclamation. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough (gloom-hill coachman, blooming jetty at twilight, after the reef dies). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the jetty groans in reply, and Elias leaves with lighter pods but heavier heart—but the cost remains gestural rather than unmistakable on the page. The line "The rest was up to the earth" reads as acceptance, yet no prior path was visibly foreclosed; the ending reweights the opening mood without demonstrating a decisive narrowing of options or a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal with atmospheric/textural layering, but closure is deferred: Elias packs and prepares to descend, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—cost is anticipated, not paid. The riddle and phonograph cylinder provide information but do not narrow options or force a crystallized stance with felt consequence. Orientation is anchored early (scrapyard, Elias's truck, post-war wasteland), so no penalty there. The piece teaches its premise but stops before delivering closure with legible cost under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: time-stretched setting, family sketching ritual, and the anomaly build density toward the final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~120 words. The closure is a Charged Poise—Elias at threshold, pencil trembling, about to draw—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible as a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The anomaly's appearance and compass reaction provide a tightening, yet the final beat asserts possibility without dramatizing what Elias risks or loses by crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when) within the first paragraph. The plot advances through motivated beats: climb → encounter → trade → departure, with the guardian's reversal ("not clever enough") creating a micro-turn. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the sundial lid becomes a question rather than an answer, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (the unknown now embraces her). The cost is primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, which prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is delayed—"who" and "where" anchor by ~150 words, and "when" (interregnum) clarifies later still, creating mild drift without taught disorientation. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: footsteps spell words, the gallery amplifies voices, the historian arrives, they walk together, and Liora commits to becoming the historian rather than a pawn. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with conceptual cost—she renounces the pawn role—but the felt price remains abstract. The final image of leaving the chessboard behind gestures toward cost without dramatizing the forfeiture on the page in a way that makes before/after stakes viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mercury imagery, feather texture, and labyrinth motifs accumulate toward the stone encounter. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive promptly; the three-year span and dream-to-descent structure provide coherence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the feather dissolves, mountain rearranges, Elias "understands"), but cost remains conceptual and off-page—no foreclosed path is legible in the final image. The "thunder he'd always heard wasn't hidden—it was waiting to be named" offers thematic assertion rather than a felt price, weakening the closure under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (thread-decoding accumulates toward the mirror-memory confrontation; the final exhale is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis variant—where Elias forgives himself and ceases fidgeting, a visible cost of letting go). The orientation anchors (Elias, Harkensleep, seven years post-exile) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the black thread unravels the tapestry and opens the platinum mirror, narrowing options to confrontation. The closure's cost is felt (the labyrinth cools, fidgeting stops) and the lens holds. Minor slip: the mirror-memory sequence is slightly expository rather than fully dramatized choice-by-choice, but the reweighting at "You only get to forgive yourself" is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation debt is present: "who" (Lira) is named early, but "where" (the towers' geography relative to the pale spire) and "when" (how imminent is the ritual?) remain vague past the 120-word mark, and the effect does not pay off at closure—apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test and cap Q3 at 7.0. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density via poetic recursion and mist imagery), but the closure unit is weak: the final beat ("The ritual could wait. She had a truth to shatter first.") asserts a stance without showing cost or a decisive change on the page, reading more as postponement than Earned Stasis or Charged Poise. The spire's reveal (etched with Lira's words) is a conceptual turn, but it arrives via summary ("For the first time, Lira saw") rather than dramatized discovery that alters her options in the moment. No meaningful tightening occurs—pressure remains static across beats, and Echo's appearance complicates without escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern break via pockmark-to-scar matching reweights the stake). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—statue splitting and memories flooding back—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the option to dissolve is foreclosed, the workshop steadies). Cost is felt in the gasped breath and the image of gold-filled cracks, though the emotional price could be sharper. The final beat earns its turn through the established pattern of scars and pockmarks, and the key charm's glow signals the shift. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: phosphorescent veins, the painted shell, older paintings, and the blank canvas accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the closure unit—Elias understanding the cave as "a threshold" and beginning to paint—lacks visible cost; the wet palette and blank canvas appear coincidentally rather than earned by prior causality. The piece teaches a pattern of memory-laden recursion but the final image does not reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: Elias performs an experiment to validate his thesis, and the story accumulates atmospheric pressure toward a charged final image. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—the world "listening" reweights prior material and the dawn image crystallizes the thesis—but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt in a forfeited option or visible trade-off. The vial drop and echo constitute one meaningful tightening; causality holds under the situational lens, though the supernatural echo lacks established rules to constrain or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: symbols, phone calls, and journeys layer without sharp causal turns. Orientation is established (starlit station, dried sea, Elias alone) by the second paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "the censer had led him here for a reason"—but the final image only promises future discovery rather than reweighting what came before with felt cost. The piece walks toward the moon with hope intact, which lands as open setup rather than a decisive shift or charged crystallization of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Mira buries the eye and accepts that "safety wasn't in silence...It was in the storm," a stance crystallization that forecloses her prior path with visible cost (her fear remains, psychological walls dismantled). The lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the eye discovery → testing → dream → burial sequence tightens causally, while sensory and thematic density builds to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly (ravine orchard, post-empathy-virus isolation, truffle foraging). One meaningful deepening occurs when the eye amplifies rather than occludes truth, forcing the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: it layers perception, memory-as-artifact, and atmospheric density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias accepts the boutonnière as bequest and keeper role. The orientation test is satisfied (Elias, dock, twilight by ~60 words). Cost is legible but oblique: he inherits an unasked burden, "softly persistent," which reweights his routine. A single meaningful deepening—the shift from observer to keeper—suffices for this length. The closure lands on the page, though the "promise" risks summary.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs. Causality is intact: the chip's discovery → the ants' path → the cavern door form a clear because/therefore chain. The closure lands on-page (chip insertion, door activation, path illuminated) with felt cost in the form of forsaking the shop promise, though the cost is more conceptual than physically dramatized. Under a Causal lens with Accumulative elements, the ending qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallize, the path forward is reweighted). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words (queen, palace balcony, city below), waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—dreams bleed into waking, constellations etch skin, the grotto glows, the mirror parts, transformation occurs—but the causal linkage between touching the mirror and losing the constellations is elided. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (queen reborn), yet the cost is asserted ("something deeper") rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The final image ("not as a queen disenchanted, but as one reborn") tells transformation without demonstrating what was renounced or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: twilight embers, alchemical imagery, and the nautilus curl build toward a charged final moment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—Liora's decision to "share" rather than capture reweights her prior quest—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; the exact trade-off or foreclosed path is not made legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias returns and offers the vial, shifting Liora's understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (cabin, Elias, birch bark scroll). The piece establishes a Situational lens—chronological confusion and mounting dread—but the final door-swing offers atmosphere without decisive change or conceptual repricing; we see threat arriving, not Elias altering stance or knowledge with felt cost. The grave-seeing and scroll discovery supply solid setup, but the ending stops at charged suspense rather than closure that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias holds absence-as-presence, and the final image reweights his loss without explicit change. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered backstory (fire, grandmother's naming, clamp's history) and the screw-etching beat charges the ending. Cost is felt (years of displacement now reconfigured as holding something) but not dramatically forfeited on the page, keeping this shy of 8.5+. Orientation is swift: shop, morning fog, Elias at work by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (floating platform, post-storm pause, rune scholar) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora moves from failed attempts to letting the ink crystallize deliberately, producing a new rune. However, the closure's cost is abstract—"scars are stories now"—without a legible on-page sacrifice or foreclosed option. The causal link between "letting ink harden" and suddenly forming a living rune reads convenient rather than earned by prior constraint. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (memory layering, imagery deepening), but the final image asserts transformation without demonstrating what Liora gave up or what path closed.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through layered reflection, sensory reprise (bergamot/lightning), and the ritual with copper wire, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elias hears his own apology and achieves partial catharsis. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who/where/when). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—he cannot save Clara, but he can say what he needed to say—and the orchard's fall provides a final cadence shift. One meaningful tightening occurs when the perfume bottle cracks and releases its scent, reweighting the prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: lyric density and metaphoric recurrence build toward a final image that reweights "truth" and "witness." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation from witness to weaver), but the cost is asserted ("the dictionary was gone") rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint. The move from temple to void lacks a causal trigger—Elara's action (pressing the book to the stone) is described, but no on-page resistance, hesitation, or trade-off emerges to charge the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers details (fjord quiet, hydraulic hum, razor edges, horizon waver) and deepens through the blood-drop moment that snaps the horizon into focus. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "Clocks didn't measure time—they measured resistance." Cost is conceptual and felt (the pain, the clean line returning), meeting the CR standard. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words ("horizon measurement station," "Elias Voss, the hydraulic clock shepherd," "cliffs ide," "fjord quiet"). The Harkin backstory intrusion at mid-story (~40% mark) briefly stalls forward pressure but ties back to the closure realization. One meaningful deepening occurs (the blood-on-clock beat reweights all prior material).

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (rain, library, Elara) appear early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery (mica lanterns, scrawls, equations) accumulates toward a realization. However, the closure—"burn the numbers herself"—is metaphorical assertion without a visible, felt cost or a decisive change in tactics. The revelation that "the house doesn't always win" reconfigures the premise conceptually, but the on-page consequence (she will pay debts "not by playing the games he'd lost") remains abstract, not dramatized with a specific forfeiture or action that alters her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recurring caller details and the disc's charged returns. The woman's "I think I'm ready" and the boy's cessation constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara's passive listening crystallizes as consequence. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. Cost is implied rather than visibly dramatized—Mara wonders but does not act or lose anything concrete on the page—which keeps this from high-band entry despite clean structure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Elias, jetty, twilight, photo). The piece accumulates weight through memory, setting, and the locket's symbolic charge, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the locket's release reweights preservation as release). Cost is legible: he surrenders the last physical anchor to Liora. One friction: "for the first time in years, he felt Liora's presence not as a ghost, but as a whisper in the wind" tells the emotional shift rather than trusting the image to carry it, slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the station reweights from favor-hub to lesson-space, and the logistician's departure with "later" and the maxim about debt reprices Elias's quest. However, the cost is conceptual and oblique—Elias loses the moon rock but gains a feeling without on-page forfeiture of a live option or tactic, and the repricing hinges on the logistician's告 statement rather than dramatized pressure that forces Elias to choose or renounce. The middle escalation is a single encounter; no meaningful tightening or narrowing of options precedes the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, dowsing for stillpoint) arrive early. The piece accumulates density through sensory layering and the trail of notes, then shifts cadence at the clearing where the melody swells and Liora presses her palm to the tree. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she cannot return to the stillpoint "not in the same way," and she carries its song as "a map of her own making." Cost is conceptual—the stillpoint is lost as an external destination—but the final image of "home in the silence between the notes" reweights the quest with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening is present; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals a Hybrid lens (causal backstory + accumulative atmosphere) but never delivers a clear closure unit. The ending offers readiness to edit ("decide what to keep") but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost—Liora stands, brushes dust, and declares intent without altering options or forfeiting a path. The three-year mistake and misinterpreted signal are exposition rather than on-page causality; the anomaly functions as atmospheric dressing without constraining a present choice. Orientation is clear, but the closure test fails: no before/after is legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (moonlight, silence, sign language) culminating in a cadence shift at "Keep going." Orientation anchors cleanly (harbor, dock, Lena+Elias, night). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final "she felt seen" crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (the price of being forgotten now reweighted by witness). The RR reconfigures the dominant stake (translating silence into music) but the cost remains largely told rather than shown in a concrete forfeit or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the first paragraph, though "off the grid" remains vague. The dominant lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: clues build toward the seal revelation, but the final turn (tapestry completes mural, lock begins to turn) lands as a Charged Poise—options crystallize without full cost paid on the page. The ellipsis from "three years" to this archive is unmotivated; no scene choice narrows her path or raises the price. The "You were always part of the message" line asserts causality not earned by prior beats. Cost at closure is implied (the seal turning) but not felt in forfeited safety or relational breach.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memory fragments and the drumming motif layer toward a final charged image where Elias and Liora merge at the lagoon. One meaningful deepening occurs when the restraints snap and Elias commits to the run. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shared dream made literal), but the cost—what Elias forfeits by becoming entangled—remains atmospheric rather than legible; we see transformation but not a visible price that narrows options or forecloses a former path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Situational/Hybrid—pressure accumulates through the geomagnetic storm and the map's instructions, then shifts to interpersonal exchange at the end. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 2). The closure unit reads as Charged Poise: Elias and the woman agree to test the whisper theory, options crystallize, but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The key exchange and final smile suggest a beginning rather than a consequence with felt weight. One meaningful tightening occurs (following the map to identify the woman's walk), but the ending reconfigures forward possibility more than it reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory layering (rain, light patterns, darkness swallowing the dock) and the encounter with the child deepens the demonstration of Maris's method. Orientation is clean (cobalt dock, dusk, Maris cross-legged) by the second paragraph. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maris reaffirms her practice after the girl leaves, but the cost is conceptual rather than legible on the page—no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered, no price paid in the final image. The causality is consistent and the lens holds, but the ending's lack of a sharp, on-page cost or reweighting caps the score at 7.2 per the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elias is (coach, organizer, griever) and what he's organizing remain vague past 120 words, and the grotto's mechanics are never clarified. The story accumulates atmosphere but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost at closure—Elias steps into the night with magnets and synchronized displays, but no before/after in options or knowledge is dramatized. The dominant lens (Accumulative/Textural) is gestured at through repeated images (mist, shadows, whispers) but the final image does not reweight stakes or meaning with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes orientation cleanly (Port Veyra docks, morning cargo work) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Lirien's stance toward self-concealment shifts decisively. However, the island sequence operates under dream logic without teaching its rules—spatial coherence dissolves ("the temple walls began to dissolve like salt in water"), then she wakes on shore with no causal bridge. The scrimshaw crumbles conveniently after delivering its message, and the final "she knew she would return" declares intent without demonstrating changed options or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rituals accrete pressure through density and pattern (tea narration, whittling, dried flowers). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis ("the ritual was all he had left"), but the cost is told rather than shown in a decisive image; the final lines loop description without reweighting prior material. The ending fails the Cost proof test—no exact sentence makes the foreclosure legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: atmosphere and image density build toward a final reconfiguration where the poet becomes "someone who had walked through the poem." The ice crack, hum intensification, and dimming light signal a shift, and the final image reweights her stance from seeker to transformed participant. However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeit or visible trade-off anchors the change. Orientation is clear early (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, cloud-shadow poet), and the lens holds, but the closure lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (glassblower's courtyard, Elias painting, his colorblindness). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: jasmine awakens, glass shard appears, final painting integrates these gifts into a moment of artistic confidence. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elias no longer fears the canvas, and the courtyard "hums with possibility"—but the cost is implied (years of struggle) rather than shown as a fresh forfeiture in this scene, keeping it just shy of high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered imagery (laboratory, bells, lens, vibrations) building toward a conceptual repricing in the final line. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The closure attempt—"the texture of connection wasn't something to be discovered"—feels incomplete on the page; the sentence breaks mid-thought without landing a visible reweighting or felt cost, reading more like a setup for an off-page epiphany than an on-page reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening occurs (lens vibrating from walls, syncing with pulse), but the ending does not deliver a decisive image or action that makes the before/after legible with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: origami figures and coordinates layer meaning through spatial movement and recurrence, culminating in the telescope revelation. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (observatory, Elias, mourning work). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias decides to "wear the grief, not drown in it"), but the cost is abstract—what path has he visibly foreclosed? The city's clocks chiming and his smile suggest renewal without showing what he has sacrificed or what specific future option he has ruled out. The origami trail functions as coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, which fits Situational/Accumulative design, yet the final turn hinges on Liora's spectral advice rather than Elias's own causal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates textural pressure through card descriptions and the anonymous message, teaching a pattern of layered mystery. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Lira's reply *How?* crystallizes her decision to step into the map, and the response "By measuring what's left" reweights the measuring-tape motif with conceptual resonance. However, the cost remains implied rather than visibly paid—no on-page forfeiture or consequence that alters her situation is dramatized, keeping the closure legible but thin on felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and nostalgic imagery build density toward the final dissolving-light image. However, the closure unit—Elara's realization and the archive's dissolution—lacks a legible cost on the page; the transition from pursuit to release feels declarative rather than paid for by prior causality. The final beat offers Resonant Reconfiguration in mood but the "felt cost" required by the definition remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through layered imagery (library, shadow, river memory) and builds density toward the footage-merge moment. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope reframed as movement rather than stasis—with felt cost implicit in years of patient observation. Orientation anchors (library, Elias, the stone, the shadow) land within the first 120 words. The tightening is legible: Elias's theory crystallizes when the footage overlaps and the shadow stills, signaling a shift from searching to listening. Cost is implied but not sharply visible on the page, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph: Elias, workshop, post-betrayal timeframe. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through recurring images (mist, tail, jars, adhesive) and a tonal tightening from betrayal to quiet agency. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias moves from clinging to "what was broken" to trimming the ragged edge and beginning to write, foreclosing his former naiveté with a felt cost—"the whole illusion" is named and shed. The middle section's reflective weight (poacher backstory, belief in goodness) risks flatness, but the final beat of trimming and writing reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure (the tower, garden, tunnel, chamber accumulate toward a reweighted final image). Orientation is anchored early (tower, dawn, Elias). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding/repricing): Elias realizes the miracle was displaced and "for the first time in years, the scars on his skin didn't ache." Cost is implied (years of aching scars now resolved) but the on-page price—what he forfeits or what changes his options—remains abstract. The hourglass shattering and the chamber discovery feel like reveals rather than choices that narrow his stance. Closure lands but the felt cost is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, Orpheum booth, three nights in) land early and clearly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: psychometry reading deepens from touch to vision to projector activation, building pressure through sensory intensification. However, the closure moment—"The ink was still wet"—gestures toward a conceptual repricing (the song and letters exist across time) but the cost remains oblique; we see no tangible sacrifice, forfeited option, or visible consequence that reweights Mira's situation on the page. The projector whirring "on its own" and the pen's wet ink suggest magical payoff without dramatized friction, reducing closure to a moment of discovery rather than a reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is swift: who, where, and when anchor by the opening. The dominant stake—freeing creativity—is signaled but never meaningfully narrowed; Liora arrives blocked and departs unblocked via passive reception of "unspoken words" without a decision that forecloses a path. The ending offers Earned Stasis language ("letting go") yet no visible cost: she retains the stories, sleeps peacefully, and the instrument's discard is unmotivated by prior use. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the final image does not reweight the stake—it summarizes fulfillment without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The archive arrival and dune-to-chamber transition show pattern coherence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias pockets the clock and shifts his mission from cargo-guarding to spark-guarding. Cost is conceptual—he now carries responsibility for mending fractures—but the final image "guarding the sparks" remains abstract; the piece does not show what concrete choice or forfeiture this entails on the page, weakening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens (hum of insight, wind through trees, dissolving gear) but the closure unit lacks legible cost. The philosopher's translocation and final step forward occur without visible forfeiture or changed options; he simply moves deeper into an abstract space. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The linkage from gear pickup to translocation to final dissolution relies on lyric accumulation, but the "wild frontier" remains conceptual rather than a felt reconfiguration with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elias, Veiled Ridgeway, ferry). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: violet glow, star stamp, lanterns build toward the final step. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("she didn't feel like a passenger"), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt—no on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off. The backstory block (~20%) primes the present but doesn't tilt a concrete choice. One meaningful deepening (cove arrival) tightens atmosphere without narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the discoloration thread, missing bolt, and practice-room reveal build density toward a thematic reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure attempts Charged Poise—Elias rejects Madame Veyra's offer and vows to pursue the unanswered question—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no visible price is paid in the final image, and the piece ends on declaration rather than a reweighted constraint or loss. The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where Elias forfeits access, safety, or standing by placing the sheet back and leaving.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around pattern and image accumulation—iron gall ink, the rune, constellation pauses—building toward a Charged Poise closure where Liora tucks the scroll and the constellations shift, crystallizing her readiness with undeniable pressure. Orientation is swift (temple library, Liora, pretender's reign by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scroll reveals the rune's mechanics and Liora internalizes its pulse, narrowing her path to truth-wielding rather than force. Cost is felt conceptually—she has kept silence, the pretender will crumble—but the final image stops at preparation rather than a decisive act or visible forfeiture on the page, capping closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers clues (torn page, AI query, hidden atlas pages) toward a pattern-break revelation. Orientation anchors promptly (station, Elara, post-ban era). Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the answering knock reweights the station's solitude and the erasure into a hidden presence—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or altered option. The lens holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory intensification—hum to roar—and the final palm-press constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's stance crystallizes with undeniable pressure ("the fire wasn't gone—it just needed someone to reignite it"). Cost is legible as opportunity and commitment: Lira moves from passive observation to active agency, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening drives the closure under the accumulative lens, meeting the 600–800 word standard.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens inferred as Causal-Situational Hybrid; the unsealing decision lands on the page, but the closure unit lacks visible cost—Mira smiles and declares "Now we begin" without forfeiting a live option or facing immediate consequence. The three-night decoding happens off-page, eliding the pressure that would narrow her choices. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, penalty waived. The embryo's dissolution is told, not shown, flattening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Lena turns from the photograph to the cutting, foreclosing grief-as-event in favor of tending-as-endurance. Orientation anchors quickly (arboretum, Lena, post-strike). Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the orchid's recurrence, the photograph's burial-then-sprouting, and somatic markers layer to reweight "hope" into "endurance." One meaningful deepening occurs when the drone sound passes and she exhales, crystallizing her shift from paralysis to rooted attention. Cost is legible: she buries the sister's image and commits to a fragile, unglamorous persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when by ~120 words (lighthouse library, Elias post-breakup, present). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias redesigns the cards and portrait, lies down as the walls close, then wakes to begin again—a refusal to escape that forecloses the old path with felt cost. The "walls closing/expanding" cycle functions as a metaphorical deepening rather than a causal turn, appropriate for the chosen lens. One meaningful cost: he stops trying to capture her and instead draws the ache itself.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens cleanly—who, where, when anchored by ~50 words—and attempts a causal chain: eclipse tension → drone → screaming child → ink manifestation → Elias's resolve. However, the closure is a statement of future intent ("he would track them") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The ink's resolution (child healed, mark vanished) removes the immediate pressure without foreclosing a path or altering Elias's present options in a legible way. The lens reads Causal early, but the ending gesture lacks the cost-on-page that would validate closure under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images of preservation and thaw, the Mirror vision, and the final act of planting the letter deepen the central question without tight causal linkage. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"some conversations were better started than finished"—that reweights the premise with implied social cost. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. One tightening occurs: Elias moves from admiring silence to provoking confrontation. Cost is conceptual but legible: he leaves evidence that will expose him to the Order's retaliation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by paragraph two (who/where/when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the father stands with the wilting rose, the bounty unclaimed, and Liora returns to the soil—options reconfigured with felt cost (he leaves empty-handed, she accepts isolation). However, the cost is asserted more than shown; we do not see him walk away or her face a consequence. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (desert roses as recurring motif, cadence shift at the end), but the final image is diluted by the explanatory paragraph ("The bounty would remain unclaimed...") rather than trusting the rose-wilting image alone. Cost proof is present but muffled.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs and maintains coherent Accumulative/Textural pressure through the sound wave garden's shifting resonance. Closure arrives on-page when Kael "catches the echo" and the stars settle, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains abstract—we're told the tide is "cool and indifferent" and he'll keep listening, but what concrete path has been foreclosed? The accumulative design builds density effectively, but the final image doesn't make the price undeniable enough to enter the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are delayed: who Elara is and her precise present action don't cohere until the inkwell/letter sequence around 40%. The journalist's call functions as inciting pressure but remains off-page summary; the obituary-scrubbing and father's death are backstory that dominate the present frame. A causal lens is implied but undercut by heavy reflection; the ending "stepped into the light" offers Charged Poise (options crystallized, stakes visible) but the cost—what she risks by going—is gestured at rather than made concrete. The orientation delay triggers a −0.4 penalty here and caps Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and holds a single POV across two temporal layers (present laboratory work, backstory accident). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias stitches the past into his skin and "the cries had quieted...because he had finally listened." Yet the causal link is weak—why does tattooing with amber-infused ink achieve what years of building machines could not? The letters "no longer unsent—they were written in his skin" is metaphorically resonant but leaves the concrete cost unclear: what path is foreclosed, what option lost? The firmware's sudden dimming and the ghosts becoming "softer" read as outcomes granted by the text rather than earned by a visible sacrifice or irreversible act. Under a Causal lens, the machinery → tattoo pivot lacks motivated ellipsis; under Accumulative, the final image reweights but without legible felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first ~100 words. The story reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (chalk, mist, tiles, mandala), and the final beat—lines glowing after the mandala stills—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the grotto's role as repository of unsaid things. Cost is conceptually legible (the town's "unlearning" leaves psychic residue; Liora acknowledges the weight) but not viscerally paid on the page at closure. The because/therefore chain is soft: Liora listens, hears the grotto breathing, presses the flake, and the mandala responds—functional but more coincidental assist than protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who, where, and when promptly and accumulates pressure through layered backstory and the stepping stone's emergence. The closure—placing the lapis piece where *Amira* had been and choosing to keep the name while reweighting its meaning—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains more asserted ("for the first time in years, she wasn't alone") than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. One meaningful deepening is present; the accumulative design holds, but the felt cost at closure is oblique, limiting entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (garden gate, after closing, hedge maze). The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora takes Elias's hand amid the fractured echoes, crystallizing the possibility of her encore. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page consequence or forfeited path is visible. The coin-spinning beat creates a vivid textural shift but doesn't narrow options in a felt way; the ending suspends rather than reconfigures with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (studio, post-shock, Mara's POV). The closure—Mara painting pathways in air, taking Eli's hand, believing her own challenge—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she moves from skeptic to believer with the cost of living with the pill's effects rather than reversing them. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sensory density, paint motif, pathways deepen). One clear tightening occurs when she touches the thread and sees another's memory, forcing the realization that the pill revealed rather than rewired. Cost is felt but somewhat abstract; the "live with it" stance is asserted more than enacted with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (coastal cave, sensory mapper, post-apocalyptic), infers a Causal lens through progressive discovery (dreams → heat device → entity appearance → merger), and delivers an on-page closure: Eira merges with the entity and wakes transformed, able to answer the unknown. Cost is suggested (device shatters, cave swallows her) but the final image—warm fossil, rain smell, "knew how to answer"—reads more as empowerment than foreclosure. The merger itself happens quickly without visible trade-off on the page, weakening the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when promptly (amber warehouse, Mira, seven years of turning). Causality is loose but coherent under the accumulative lens: cataloging buttons → finding the last button → sand reversal → Mira's deliberate re-turn. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she chooses continuation over fulfillment, and the canyon echo's "single, soft note" charges the final image with shared wisdom. Cost is legible—she relinquishes the prophecy's promised transformation—but the price feels more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, Zephyr Bluff, post-fire aftermath) appear within ~120 words; no penalty. The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (mist, codes, pillbox, key, hidden door) and a cadence shift at the final paragraph reweights the dominant stake (redemption → carrying forward what was abandoned) with conceptual cost (accepting incompleteness). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the decision to pocket the file and leave the pillbox crystallizes Elias's stance with undeniable pressure, even if the relational cost is oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs when the key turns and the file's contents narrow options from personal absolution to collective responsibility. The causal chain is light but sufficient for the accumulative lens; the key's arrival feels seeded but slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when clearly within the opening paragraphs. The storm builds atmospherically, but the causal spine is thin: Elias repairs the rope, rows across, and finds serenity—no decision narrows options or changes knowledge in a way that makes a legible before/after. The ending offers a mood shift (weight lifting) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing; the final image is lyric but does not reweight prior material with felt pressure. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the closure lacks the density increase or cadence break that would charge the final moment with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Ren, oasis, cracked earth). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (clay bowl, lantern glass cracks, lavender blooming out of season, wind humming through hives) that teach the oasis as a time-folded site. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the lantern whole, bowl filled with honey) signaling the oasis has pulled a prior state forward—cost reads as conceptual (the weight of "every version of itself at once") rather than a visible sacrifice Ren makes. The tightening is atmospheric cadence shift rather than a causal turn, which fits the lens. Slight weakness: the final image asserts transformation without showing what Ren risked or lost to achieve it, making the cost felt but not dramatically earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (fire escape, harbor, moonlight, Elias tending rosebush). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure gathers through layered images (petal drop, quivering hush, rusted key) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias trades the bitting gauge for Lila's future, crystallizing his shift from cultivating beauty for himself to enabling it in another. Cost is legible—he surrenders his last paternal relic. One micro-deduction: the final paragraph's "somewhere, a key turned" abstracts the closure image slightly, pulling away from the concrete exchange that just occurred.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when early (Lira, tidal library, after reincarnation memory). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the sundial's shadow guides her through the library's response, culminating in a moment where "past and present coexist without conflict." However, the closure unit—feeling "lighter" and choosing to "carry it forward"—is asserted rather than shown through a decisive image or action with visible cost. The cost of Lira's endurance or stance crystallization remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or reweighted constraint makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-seeking, recurring twig/nest imagery, and a final image that reweights the opening spiral motif. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirror reflection, the twig in her hair, the keeper's affirmation), but the cost remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is legible in the final beats. The keeper's line "You found the pattern" and Mira's "I just stopped looking for it" function as thematic summary rather than a decisive image that makes the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causality is clean: Mara detects the anomalies, devises a counter-signal, and activates it; the subsonic pulse smooths the charts and diffuses campus tension. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community tension dissipates, Mara is "cautiously hopeful," and she acknowledges wars yet to come. However, the cost is more asserted than shown—"the weight of the night pressing down"—and the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the tricksters simply lose their hold off-page. Orientation is immediate (university radio station, Mara at the controls, tonight), and the lens is causal with a clean midpoint turn when she decides to interfere.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elias, Nexus bowels, fallow period). The piece follows a Causal lens: Elias enters seeking the spatial-mutiny key → hears organ → finds the figure → touches compass → world-shift revelation. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—spatial mutiny reweighted from "rebellion" to "freedom," and the Nexus reframed as dimension-sailing vessel—but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than dramatized (claustrophobia "forgotten" is告知 not shown as renunciation with visible price). One meaningful deepening occurs when the figure extends the compass, narrowing Elias's options to accept or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately. The closure—Elara completing Liora's portrait and making her "whole"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a dramatized trade-off. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final image), yet the figure's revelations arrive conveniently without prior setup, weakening causal linkage. The ending reweights Liora's story, but the sibling's late entrance and the lance's sudden importance feel planted rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative touches (coded stanzas, nail-as-key mystery). Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN by the second paragraph. The nail → furnace lock is a clean reversal that narrows options and reweights Elias's exile from punishment to mission. Closure lands on-page: Mira realizes "Exile is reversible, but so is the sky" and "He'd been sent," which reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (she inherits a hidden mandate). The final beat—"whether she was brave enough to finish what he'd started"—feels slightly告知 rather than crystallized in action, reducing felt immediacy. Cost is legible but not viscerally paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: observation → reflection → recounted memory → final image. Orientation anchors (mountain pullout, fiddle, post-hitchhiker timeframe) arrive clearly. However, no decisive change, renunciation with visible cost, or reconfiguration occurs on the page; Lena ends where she began—playing, walking to her car, ready to follow the road—with the glass flake tucked away as a keepsake rather than a constraint or price. The ending offers atmospheric resonance but lacks the undeniable felt or conceptual cost required for closure under any lens. The "luminous disbelief" and mist-dissolving valley provide mood, not a before/after shift in options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, circus train, dusky present) arrive cleanly by the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered memory (father's thefts, Crimson Horizon's collapse, circus detritus) until the final image—Elias leaving, reframing circles as widening spirals—reweights the dominant question with conceptual cost (he steps away from the literal site but carries the lesson). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing that holds, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered dream-visions and the telegram, culminating in Elias's realization. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—he decides to gather dreamers and share the burden—but the cost remains abstract and the final action is stated rather than shown. Orientation anchors are present early (observatory, Elias, his role). The piece teaches its reflective pattern, but the because/therefore linkage from dream repetition to final insight feels asserted rather than causally tightened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative undertones (the plant's tendrils literally unravel memories in expanding circles). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 5. The seed's test creates a because/therefore chain: plant tastes memories → Veyra confesses → vortex responds → mirror reveals truth → child's threat crystallizes consequence. Closure is Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: the curse lifts "not in the way the Circle had hoped," and Veyra must live with exposed complicity. Cost is conceptual (lost moral footing) and relational (the child's enmity). One meaningful tightening occurs when the plant demands the frozen confession. No causality breaks, though the mirror's sudden appearance in the lake feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where adequately, but the timeframe "after the future arrives early" remains metaphorical rather than dramatic. The closure dissolves the glade into a star-strewn plain and ends on "Together," a declaration without visible cost or stakes reconfiguration—RR/CR are absent because no option is foreclosed and no price is paid on the page. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the final image doesn't reweight prior material through pattern break or cadence shift, only through assertion. The cost proof test fails: no sentence demonstrates what Elias loses or risks in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens with Liora's goal (retrieve her brother) driving tactics (weeks of ritual preparation) that lead to the stranger's offer and her decision. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she relinquishes the retrieval quest by trading the memory, accepting the unfillable hole with visible cost ("her soul heavier"). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. The escalation tightens cleanly: preparation → confrontation → price revelation → sacrifice, with each beat narrowing options until the final choice forecloses the original path.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (quarry office, Jake, post-crash), satisfying the orientation test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the grille cloth seed, the quarry singing, and Lena's return layer toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure—Lena's line "confidently uncertain" and Jake "listening to the future"—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality; the cost (what Jake forfeits or risks by engaging with Lena) remains abstract. The coincidence of Lena appearing exactly when Jake visits the pit at night resolves tension rather than complicating it, violating situational and causal norms.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and clearly. The closure—Elara translating new script after the arbor responds, establishing connection—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the arbor's relief, her commitment to sustain it) with emotional and conceptual cost legible in "her eyes stinging" and the vow "never faded again." Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered description, the seed's insertion, and the final script shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cuneiform rearranges into "*Not lost. Only changed.*"—reweighting prior yearning with a concrete answer. Minor slip: the guardian's vanishing and Elara's three-month journey are told rather than pressuring present action directly, but the closure image holds.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the creel filling and final release create a cadence shift that reweights the opening emptiness. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the creel transforms from empty reminder to vessel for migrating stories), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no on-page line makes the sacrifice or trade-off undeniable. Orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored early), and the lens holds, but the final image doesn't impose a felt or visible price that the reader can point to in a specific sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the inspector's whispered confession and the pearl's dulling reconfigure her purpose with conceptual cost—the pearl's "purpose fulfilled" and her leaving the crown for the next heart. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through confessions, pearl contact, and radiance until the crown moment reweights the premise. Causality is clean (pearl dissolves confessions → crown reveals final message → inspector speaks her own fear → pearl dulls). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bunker's grief becomes her own, narrowing the question to self-confrontation. Cost is felt but understated—the pearl's dullness and her departure signal closure without a sharp forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates fragments—graffiti wisdom, accordion notes, map traces—around Lena's guilt. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (disused station, Lena, accordion, post-medication). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: "She wasn't looking for forgiveness anymore. She was looking for a way to live with the truth." The shift from seeking forgiveness to seeking a way to live is stated rather than earned through on-page action that forecloses a path; the walk toward the river at the end does not demonstrably narrow options or impose felt cost, reading more as ambient continuation than decisive reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague—"glowing library in mist" offers no spatial grounding by ~120 words, and the dreamer's identity stays abstract throughout (−0.4). The closure unit presents a Resonant Reconfiguration ("The dreamer was no longer veiled"), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt; no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with pressure. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (mist, symbols, propagation delays as texture) and Causal (two letters framing action), never stabilizing, which prevents clean escalation judgment (−0.3 lens drift).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is prompt: observatory, Elara, ice violin, midsummer twilight all land in the first paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Causal-Hybrid—violin triggers telepathy, plants urge action, father arrives to stop her, she plays and he vanishes—but the father's disappearance lacks on-page mechanism (did the plants kill him? transport him? was it metaphor?), creating a causality gap at the closure beat. The cost is stated (he's gone, future unwritten) but not shown, so the Decisive Change loses legibility. Applying −0.6 for closure-beat causality opacity and capping at mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: aurora imagery, frost motifs, and the emerald chip recur, and the ending reprises "threshold of stillness" and "lucidly watchful" with modest deepening. However, no decisive change or visible cost lands—the figure revives, Liora smiles, and the story closes on affirmation without foreclosing a path. The Resonant Reconfiguration is asserted ("the threshold held") but not dramatized with a felt price. Cost-proof test fails: no line shows what Liora loses or what option vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (grotto imagery, hairpin seed → pool dissolution). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's realization reweights "remembering differently," and the final image ("hands no longer empty") offers cadence shift. However, cost is asserted ("lighter," "peace") rather than concretely shown—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page. Orientation is clear (grotto, dawn, yew tree anchored early). The because/therefore linkage is present but light: hairpin discovery → descent → voice → dissolution → insight follows a meditative rather than causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Situational lens: Veyra's confession and Elias's listening role create pressure that crystallizes into the recognition that Veyra seeks nuance, not verdict. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lighthouse shifts from "a place of accusation" to "holding space for…uncertainty," and the final image reweights the dominant stake (unhooking Veyra) with felt cost—Elias abandons his auditor role and accepts ambiguity. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The single meaningful deepening (Elias's question prompts Veyra's confession) is sufficient for this length, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a situational lens (platform meditation + grotto hum) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara shifts from seeking reversal to understanding presence. Orientation anchors early (platform, lake, grotto). However, the closure beat ("She had not reversed time. She had simply learned to step outside of it") delivers realization through assertion rather than dramatized choice, and no visible cost is paid—no tool broken, no relationship severed, no option foreclosed. The cost remains conceptual and implied rather than legible in a concrete on-page sentence or image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and charged imagery (echoes, towers, birds, arrowhead), and the door opening offers a spatial change. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elias smiles and accepts perpetual wandering without foreclosing a live option or paying a visible price. The final paragraph's "content to wander its echoes forever" reads as thematic stasis rather than Earned Stasis with on-page consequence. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation early (spire, Elias, his goal), follows a causal chain (touch keystone → mist dissolution → courtyard encounter → drink → return with light → plant flower), and delivers Decisive Change: Elias moves from seeking grand spells to creating a simple, glowing flower with visible cost (the long walk down, the acceptance of his limitations). The dominant lens is Causal with Accumulative accents (the recurring "lingering luminance" motif). One meaningful tightening occurs when he drinks the fountain and memories surface, narrowing his understanding. Minor slip: the mentor's appearance and the courtyard's logic feel somewhat convenience-plotted—why this figure now?—but the closure lands with legible cost and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors WHO (Elias Vey, lamplighter), WHERE (pier, then sunken SS Marigold), and WHEN (tonight, leading to midnight lantern release) within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative: Elias is drawn by an unexplained key, wanders to the wreck, meets the woman, witnesses the lanterns, and "understands" his legacy—a series of revelations rather than because/therefore linkage. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the luminous vow as generational debt) plus a micro-turn (handing over the tag), but the cost is asserted ("a debt, a legacy") rather than dramatized: we don't see what Elias loses or forecloses by passing the key. The woman's line "You're late" and her exposition about truth introduce a secondary stake that competes with the dominant "discover the color of sound" without clear convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (coins, static bursts, stars) that reweight at closure. Orientation anchors (observatory deck, Elias alone, post-contraction universe) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure—Elias closing his fist around coins, ready to listen after the static resolves—reads as Charged Poise: options crystallize (stop chasing certainty, let purpose align with him) and the final image reconfigures his stance with conceptual cost (abandoning his lifetime approach). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the prophecy is backwards, forcing tactical shift. The cost is felt but oblique; the stakes remain largely interior and philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Elias, observatory, dusk, after finding recordings) within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (atlas, recordings, light) toward a final reconfiguration where Elias whispers names and the monsters dissolve. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief from centuries' weight), but the cost is asserted ("the dead, at last, were silent") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when he presses his hand to the page and the creatures respond, though causality remains soft—why this moment, why these names work now.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "after the last fish was caught" remains abstractly historical rather than present-tense pressure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: water-drip observation, bell repair, and fish return build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—"holding what was broken until it remembered how to sing"). The closure carries conceptual cost (imperfection accepted, imbalance remains) legible in the final paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell rings and fish answer, reweighting the premise from cosmic repair to acceptance of fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Charged Poise: Elias pockets the photographs and commits to telling the stories, crystallizing his stance with the felt cost of carrying suppressed history into a healing town. However, the pivot happens in summary ("He could burn... Or he could carry") rather than through a dramatized beat that narrows options on the page. The causal lens holds—photographs lead to discovery, discovery to choice—but the escalation is cognitive rather than pressured by an external turn. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fourth photograph reframes his father's narrative, sufficient for this length under a causal-accumulative hybrid.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the orchard, crystals, flame memory, and starlings layer toward a final image of letting go. Orientation anchors (Liora, orchard, waterfall) arrive promptly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization: she will "harmonize logic and intuition... by letting them dance"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no prior tactic visibly abandoned. The crystal's shattering and starlings' flight offer lyric charge, yet the "for the first time in years, Liora smiled" summary undercuts on-page pressure. One meaningful deepening (flame memory reweighted) is present, meeting minimum escalation, but the cost remains conceptual and told.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elias, arbor, post-static night). Drive lens reads Situational: coherent pressure (stranded, branch groaning, snap) forces stance crystallization (keep climbing). Closure is Earned Stasis—he pulls himself back and continues—with visible cost (buckle bite, gasps, heavier burden). The snap at 85% provides one meaningful tightening. Deductions: the parachute-fall backstory arrives late (paragraph 5) and resolves the "how did he get here" question it did not establish early, creating mild causality friction (−0.3); the final image ("kept climbing") lacks a charged reconfiguration that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, reading more as continuation than decisive change or resonant repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation efficiently (floating dojo, Kael + Veyra, training goal) and follows a causal progression: training failures → Veyra's teaching → breakthrough → departure. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael steps forward "not knowing if he'd fly or fall," crystallizing his acceptance that movement itself is victory. The cost is legible—he leaves numbness intact but reconfigured—and the lens holds as situational pressure forcing stance crystallization. One tightening occurs when Veyra's blade "sliced through the illusion" of his self-narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through repeated attempts (police called, weeping, now listening) and the lullaby's spiral through the tunnel. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias walks away after the laughter returns, foreclosing further intervention with felt cost in his solitary exit. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening—the girl's emergence and the mother's laugh—reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the final image of Elias leaving into the dark, though the cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertones. Orientation is delayed but functional by ~200 words. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she "didn't feel the need to wait"), yet cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no clear path foreclosed, no visible tradeoff on the page. The garden-as-mind metaphor and the blank-then-inscribed book are evocative, but the guardian's disappearance and Mara's standing feel like soft resets rather than earned shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (workshop, ember nexus, twilight anchored in the opening lines). The causal lens holds: Elias's realization that transformation requires breaking leads directly to the explosive sequence, and the final shard embodies the cost—twenty years discarded, gold abandoned, something new and raw in its place. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Conceptual Repricing) with felt cost. Minor debt: the "penny dropped" insight arrives through metaphor rather than a prior action forcing the realization, slightly weakening causal tightness at the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (radio tower city, lunar perigee, Mira). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through celestial signals → shard of hush → dissolution → vibration → final disappearance. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira adjusts from "searching" to "listening for the silence between." Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (she is "tuned to a frequency beyond sound, beyond time"), but the cost is implied rather than dramatically legible—she vanishes, yet the narrative insists she "found what she was looking for" without showing what was forfeited or what live option was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (ferry, grotto, stars). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—spectral imagery and time-dilation motifs build atmosphere—but the closure is a soft reset: commuters vanish, the ferry is "still," and no on-page cost or reconfiguration is legible. The radio transmission and Elias's hourglass gesture open possibilities but do not narrow options or impose felt consequences. The "permanent transient" framing promises tension between states, yet the ending restores stasis without demonstrating what was risked or lost. Closure form is a weak RR; the cost is implied off-page rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the thread loops through beats, memories flicker, and the gallery shifts, building density toward the final void-space where connection becomes tactile. However, the closure lacks legible cost—Elias steps through and "feels the texture of connection" without foreclosing options or paying a visible price. The transition from gallery to dream-space is smooth but the before/after is conceptual assertion rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien arrival) and follows a causal progression: Lirien observes alien vessels → salvages chain link → forges tools → tests starlight navigation → gathers students for expansion. However, closure cost is implied rather than legibly paid on the page; "It was time to expand" declares intent without showing what path has been foreclosed or what price Lirien has accepted. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final beat delivers aspiration rather than a felt consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (the alien vessel alignment moment), meeting minimum escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene in the atrium with clear spatial anchors and follows an accumulative lens as Lena tracks pulses deeper into the mist. Closure arrives when she touches Miriam and the mist recoils, followed by the dead calling louder and Lena's smile—a Charged Poise moment suggesting acceptance of her role. However, the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated: the final smile and declarative "She was exactly where she was meant to be" tell us resolution without showing what she has forfeited or how her options have narrowed. The Elias encounter and Miriam's appearance feel like stations in a guided tour rather than causally linked pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory density, the codex's shifting gold, and the recursive discovery of the researchers' fate, culminating in a phase-transition passage that reweights reality. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias discovers the looping data slate and understands the researchers didn't drown but "slipped sideways," which narrows his option to a single path: step through. The closure—Elias kneeling, the reversal, the flood—lands on the page with cost (death, sealing). However, the cost reads more atmospheric than felt; the final image is charged but the emotional or conceptual price remains somewhat abstract ("winking out one by one, like stars swallowed by dawn").

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and sustains it through the observatory visit, with the ghost encounter serving as the deepening moment that reweights the porcelain shard and death certificate from burdens to markers of continuity. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ghost's dissolution and final message, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—Elias's shift from counting to opening his eyes operates as Charged Poise but the foreclosed path is oblique. The "stars are still watching" image recharges earlier material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on-page: Elara traps the echoes in the diamond, transforming curse into vessel—a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the language's death now takes new form). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of echoes, bird-flock analogy, and diamond's pulse cohere through density increase and cadence shift at the tunnel sequence. Orientation anchors early (canyon, bone towers, her name and mission by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when the echoes begin to answer and she conducts them. Cost is conceptual (the old language is gone, replaced by sensation) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal-situational hybrid lens: Elias's decision to hold the phone despite Maren's warning triggers the metamorphosis, a Decisive Change with visible cost (his translucent fingers, the burn of the arrowhead). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The escalation from examination to phone contact to transformation narrows options coherently. Minor slack: "the missing return" and "the hum" are referenced but remain abstract; the garden's threshold status is asserted more than dramatized through prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric coloring. The locust shell serves as a clear trigger: its rhythm offers a key, Liora mimics it, vines erupt, she runs. Closure unit is a Decisive Change—she leaps the bridge, lands in the mechanical world, begins to play, and the world "shudders" with beauty. Cost is visible: she abandons the orchard and the statues will keep coming. Orientation is swift (orchard, sky-bridge, violinist role by line 3). One minor slip: the vines erupting feel convenient—no prior cue that her music could summon them—but the causal chain otherwise holds and the ending reconfigures her stance with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Jace, arcade, twilight border town). The piece follows a single-POV, two-shard structure (arcade interior → transition to observatory mission) with a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: details layer—undeliverable letters, the bottled storm, Mira's arrival—toward a final cadence shift that reweights Jace's carrying from futility to quiet rebellion. Closure is Charged Poise: the final lines crystallize his stance (foster hope "just a little longer") with felt cost (the weight of broken promises). The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than a decisive physical act, but the image reconfigures prior material and forecloses passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: wrong turn → discovery → singing animates fragment → train moves → oasis revealed → carousel activated. Closure is a Decisive Change (the oasis reconstitutes, Elias completes his work) with conceptual cost (he's "carried home" by magic, implying loss of agency or permanent departure). Orientation anchors by ~80 words. The chain holds, but the cost is oblique—"letting the music carry him" reads more as wish-fulfillment than renunciation, softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias and the woman stand together in the story-void, the scarf shifts from mystery to anchor, and "the world snapped back into place" signals a return with reweighted meaning. However, the cost is asserted ("the weight of the scarf now a comfort") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (library atmosphere, scarf touches, geometry motifs build density), but the final image relies on told warmth rather than a concrete, felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece orients clearly (librarian, archipelago, dream imagery) and follows an accumulative/lyric lens: Elias moves from dream to palette to painting light to photography to arrival. However, the closure—"Not yet, but I will"—registers as deferral rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The ending resets the pursuit rather than foreclosing a path or reweighting prior material; the cost (his journey, the clarity of the photograph) is asserted but not felt as a trade-off or transformation. The motivational causality (dream → palette → light-painting → photography → departure) is clean, but the final image does not land a charged closure effect under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic weight through the lock-of-hair ritual and returns to Elara at closure, delivering a micro-turn when she smiles. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when coalesce slowly across the first 150 words, costing some clarity. The closure effect is a Charged Poise moment: Elara receives permission to speak, options crystallize, but the cost (village reaction, her own risk) remains off-page and felt rather than shown. The "tell it" instruction and smile deliver reconfiguration, yet the price paid by either character is more asserted than legible in a concrete image or forfeited choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation early (twelve-year-old Elias, greenhouse, fairy ring) and the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: the broken constellations lead him back, memories surface through contact, and the ring opens to deliver Liora. Closure arrives on the page—Liora vanishes, the greenhouse shatters, leaving only the fading mushroom cap—but the cost feels more atmospheric than decisively foreclosed. The "you took too long" line gestures at consequence without fully dramatizing what path Elias has lost or what he must now endure. A stronger on-page reckoning with the trade-off (what he sacrificed by delaying, what door closed) would push this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story deepens through layered images (shadow, mirror, swing, tea leaves) that converge at closure when Elara hands Mira the cup, a Charged Poise moment where options crystallize and the cost of mentorship is felt even if not yet paid. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The piece teaches its pattern of symbolic recurrence early and pays it off; the accumulation tightens around the dominant stake (mentoring resilience vs. self-imposed exile) and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story orients who, where, and when within the first paragraph, satisfying the anchor test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding deepens from "bridge" to "vessel," and the shoot becomes a new tree), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Maren's trembling hands gesture at weight without showing what she has forfeited or risked. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered metaphor and the waterfall-seed-song pattern, but causality remains soft (the seed "pulses," the ground "trembles," echoes "flicker" without clear because/therefore linkage). The ending reweights prior material through the image of the new tree welcomed by mist, meeting the minimum threshold for closure, yet the price paid remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (prism sanctuary, Elias Veyne, restoration task) and follows a causal chain: stolen needle → unravel net knots → free trapped voices → confront mask's true nature → Fisher King's warning → final choice. Closure lands on the page with a decisive physical act and conceptual cost (unmake the mask to free spirits = butchery not restoration), satisfying the Decisive Change requirement under a Causal lens. However, the Fisher King's sudden appearance at the climactic moment relies on coincidence rather than earned setup, weakening the turn's causality; his grip and warning arrive as thematic punctuation rather than dramatized obstacle that alters Elias's options.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a causal chain (torn map → whispers → footage → chapel reopening → shoe discovery) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elias understands the whispers are "voices waiting to be heard" and the map tore because the story continues. Cost is implied (he has crossed a threshold the village forbids) but not sharply felt on the page. The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid, holding through the ending, but the final realization tilts toward stated insight rather than a choice or renunciation that visibly alters his options.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives on-page: shattering the globe releases the Marigold and Elias surfaces with a renunciation ("Some threads aren't meant to be held"). The cost is legible—he abandons salvage, lets go of retrieval—but the ghost's directive shapes the turn more than Elias's prior agency. One meaningful deepening occurs when he understands the snow globe's function, narrowing his options. Orientation is swift (diver, wreck, library). A micro causality slip: Liora's voice arrives via "crackle of an old radio" underwater without established mechanism, creating a brief logic gap that does not collapse closure but introduces friction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal arc: Elias notices graffiti → perceives the ghost → plays music → offers the bolt plate → ghost solidifies and vanishes, leaving a changed word on the wall. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost's need is met, the graffiti shifts to "Enough"), and cost is legible in the ghost's departure and Elias's stinging eyes. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the bolt plate is a key and the storm becomes the catalyst for voice. The lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture (the mist, graffiti, and music accrue symbolic weight), holding cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira renounces further intrusion with visible cost ("some secrets were not hers to unfold"). Orientation is clear by line 3. The piece follows a situational lens—pressure accumulates through discovery rather than because/therefore chains—and the final image of the captain tracing sketches charges the ending. However, the cipher's resolution ("held the diary up to the window") arrives conveniently without prior setup of the method, weakening causal earning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira realizes the diary is a love letter.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise), but cost remains oblique. "Let the wind carry him forward" can be read as suicide or metaphorical release; the ambiguity prevents legibility of what path is foreclosed. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens (cloud cataloging deepens until the *Astraea* vision reweights the stake), but the final image doesn't clearly repricing prior material—it introduces a new action without showing the before/after in options or knowledge. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). The string-breaking metaphor in paragraph two signals stakes early, but the literal tether having "snapped years ago" muddles whether the gondola is drifting or anchored, harming spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (negative space portraits, the coin map, the fractal sky sketch) toward a final reweighting where Liora refuses possession. Closure achieves Earned Stasis—she will not take the sketch—and the cost is conceptual (leaving perfection behind as the building falls). Orientation anchors quickly (tree trunk library, condemned building, dawn demolition). The tightening is modest: quest → discovery → renunciation, but the final image reweights her lifelong artistic pursuit with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: who (Elias), where (airship), and when (evening) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Causal—starlings signal patterns, Elias decodes the hopscotch board, Orlan's lantern confirms the discovery, the airship adjusts course. Closure lands on the page (the ship banks, guided by starlings), but the cost is entirely prospective ("Now we just have to follow it"); no visible forfeiture or trade-off occurs in the final image. The because/therefore chain holds, but the ending celebrates discovery without dramatizing what was risked or lost to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery and pattern). Orientation anchors arrive late: "who" is clear early, but "where" (frozen library's geography) and "when" (the timeframe's pressure) remain vague past 120 words; the hall of mirrors is named but its spatial relation to the workbench and the library's heart is unclear. The closure unit aims for Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding as bridge), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, no visible price paid. The gears "began to turn" and mirrors "flickered," but what Elias loses or what path he forecloses remains off-page. Orientation debt and absent cost on the page lower the score significantly; applying −0.4 for orientation slip and −0.6 for cost absence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors by the first paragraph (Veythar, Liora, orchard). The piece follows an accumulative lens: messages accumulate pressure until the villagers act collectively. However, the closure—Liora fading as the orchard blooms—lacks legible cost; her disappearance feels inevitable rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path. The causal chain from messages to communal action is present but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure, falling short of a true RR or CR.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors early (lighthouse, Elias, doomsday clock), accumulates symbolic objects (clock, puppet, pane), and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the final image (stillness, the puppet softening, the sea kind) reweights the opening dread with undeniable pressure and felt cost (Elias's decades of effort crystallized into one uncertain act). The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns, which fits the lens. One persistent constraint—the frozen clock hands—shapes the final image. Cost is legible in "didn't know if the lullaby would reach the right ears" and the persistent brokenness ("smile didn't mend").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (orchard, cliff, Mira kneeling) and the causal chain is clean: curse binds her → she finds blueprint → realizes nut marks a path → scatters nuts → man follows them to escape. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira secures one more night's balance, the curse holds, and she returns to tending the orchard with visible cost (she remains bound, the fruit will never ripen). The inferred lens is Causal with situational undertones; the tightening occurs when the man appears and Mira must execute her plan under immediate pressure. One ellipsis (how she moved from blueprint discovery to nut-scattering) is brief and motivated by urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early (Lina at ravine edge). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of ravine-as-map reweights her earlier sense of the divergent path as failure. Cost is felt but oblique: the grief "loosens" and she turns back, but the text doesn't specify what concrete path or relationship option has been foreclosed. One tightening occurs when foam patterns shift her research direction, narrowing her approach from permanence to impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric intent. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~150 words of abstraction, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("the moment before the first word is spoken"), but cost remains atmospheric—no on-page forfeiture or reweighted prior material with undeniable pressure. The woman's transaction and dissolution function as ornament rather than a causal turn that narrows Elias's options.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Maren comes to "subdue" Kael, their contact transmits memories, and her sharing his grief enables his departure. Orientation anchors (desert fortress, Maren, Kael, pavilion) arrive early. The closure—Kael standing and walking out with Maren after her hand-squeeze and dialogue persuasion—constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (Maren's memories are "lighter now, as if sharing his had diluted their weight"). One meaningful tightening occurs when she reaches for his hand despite the prickle, narrowing her options. The pavilion's coral pulsing "warm for the first time in centuries" at the threshold supplies a charged image that reweights prior material, supporting Resonant Reconfiguration as well. Cost is legible but somewhat diffuse; the story tells us Maren's memories lighten rather than showing a specific forfeiture or later tactic change.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when established by the opening). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the tower becomes a gathering place—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. The accumulative lens (community voices weaving together) is legible, yet the final image ("bridges between silos") restates the opening metaphor without decisive tightening or pressure. The weeks-pass summary flattens what should be the story's most pressured beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "helix-minded" and "synaptic plasticity" remain abstract labels until near the end. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the mirror's fractures gather meaning through reflection and the woman's whispered advice, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Lena chooses preservation over repair. Cost is implied—she inherits the woman's incompleteness—but the final image ("her heart a quaking reverie") asserts emotional charge rather than anchoring it in a concrete, final sensory beat. The closure lands under the chosen lens with visible renunciation, though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Elara follows manuscript doodles → discovers chamber → opens book → claims guardian role. Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (identity shift from archivist to guardian), but the cost is asserted ("carry this secret," "flame in the dark") rather than dramatized through forfeiture or altered tactics. The "next hour of inversion" frames future stakes but does not land a felt price on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when symbols rearrange and the book bleeds new meanings, satisfying minimal escalation under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who/where/when adequately early (Elias, grove, post-winter). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the grove "no longer silent"), but the cost remains abstract—no tangible path is foreclosed, no option visibly narrowed. The insulator's placement and the emerging melody accumulate toward the final image, yet the before/after lacks felt weight; Elias simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly and pursues a coherent accumulative lens: Elias and Lysara decode the nexus through patient observation, culminating in the covenant's revelation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration affirming patience and meaning in exile—lands thematically, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; Elias's decision to stay does not visibly foreclose an alternate path on the page. The revelatory moment (symbols form, meaning becomes clear) feels told rather than dramatized, softening the climactic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when promptly and follows a causal progression: Elias's device-tuning attempt is interrupted by Liora's arrival, which shifts the goal from mechanical unlocking to emotional reconciliation. The closure—diary opened by the tuning fork Liora provides—lands on the page with visible cost (years of estrangement crystallized in one sentence of script). The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative elements; the final image reweights prior material cleanly. Minor penalty: Liora's Arctic sojourn and her reasons for returning remain summary-only, slightly softening the causal chain at the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with mild Situational coloring. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (treetop village, evening, Mira's balcony). The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's insight that "serenity wasn't in the destination" reweights her obsession with the bloom—but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible on the page. The grandmother's journal arrives as a structural convenience in the final third without prior setup, weakening causal linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs (journal reveals prior failure), but the reconfiguration feels more like a thematic declaration than a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens early with layered images (binary suns, floating arches, harp-string hum) and closes with a resonant reconfiguration: Lira's realization that resilience means bending rather than resisting. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The closure lands on the page—the grove's glow intensifies, fruit bursts into upward-drifting seeds, and Lira's understanding reweights her stance. However, the cost feels largely conceptual rather than felt; she loses no option, pays no visible price, and her smile suggests satisfaction without sacrifice, keeping the ending from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure—containers sealing shut with Elias trapped—lands on the page as a decisive physical change, and the cost (his entrapment) is visible. However, the causal chain from wind documentation to city-as-machine to chase-and-seal feels more asserted than earned; the "city is learning" leap arrives without intermediate beats showing how his actions trigger the pursuit. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of discovery → reweighting), but the final trap feels coincidental rather than a consequence of his investigative choices. Orientation is clear early (port city, investigator, three days post-silence).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when cleanly (ice cavern, Eira, bell ringer, tonight). Closure reads as a Decisive Change: the song is released and the sculptor's chisel falls silent. However, the causal chain is thin—the sculptor's disruption is external coincidence that complicates but does not force Eira's agency; her success feels willed rather than wrestled from prior constraint. The inferred lens is Causal-leaning Hybrid, but the because/therefore linkage from chisel strikes to bell choices is loose, and no visible cost accompanies the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal lens early (guardian failed → boundary torn → seek flute's purpose) and the closure unit—playing a melody to weave rather than seal—lands on the page with a conceptual shift. However, the cost remains abstract: "the quiet of a held breath finally released" describes atmosphere rather than showing what Elias has foreclosed or paid. The figure's revelation arrives as exposition ("It is not meant to seal... it is meant to weave") rather than through dramatized discovery, weakening the earned quality of the turn. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and conceptual density increase through the press work, fragment hum, and borrowed voices, culminating in the dissolution and quiet finale. Orientation anchors (Elias, topaz workshop, stars vanishing) arrive early and hold. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias stands alone, hollow, equations waiting—but the cost remains oblique: the fragment dissolves, borrowed voices unravel, yet no prior option or tactic is visibly foreclosed on the page. The mathematician's line "The universe doesn't care about your feelings. It only cares about the numbers" gestures toward conceptual repricing, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with auroras, pendant vibrations, and the stranger converging toward a threshold moment. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the courier steps forward with steady hands after the stranger dissolves, the pendant cold but the air still humming—a reconfiguration of her stance from routine deliveries to inward movement. Cost is visible (the magic spent, the mentor's path now hers) but the escalation is primarily atmospheric; the stranger's appearance and departure feel coincidental rather than causally forced by her prior choices. Orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the arbor hums, memories surface, patterns accumulate toward a conceptual repricing—objects are mirrors, not sponges—that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (Elias, quartz arbor, mist, cold air) land early. The closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: "not just memories, but the spaces between them," paired with the melted frost suggesting transformation. Cost is oblique—Elias sought proof but found "something else"—which registers conceptually but lacks a felt forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the man's memory unfolds, but the accumulation of vibrations, frost patterns, and prism work feels more like thematic layering than a tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: threads, looms, and the orchard accumulate symbolic weight. Orientation is delayed—who she is and where she stands emerge gradually through abstractions rather than concrete anchors by ~120 words. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the message reweights her isolation and the loom becomes a metaphor for reconnection. However, the cost is asserted ("the silence was no longer a weight. It was a beginning") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or physical consequence on the page. The journey sequence compresses causality into summary ("followed the puzzle's edges"), weakening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchards will live; Elias finds his voice), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page sacrifice, forfeiture, or tactical price paid during the sealing work itself. The causal chain is clean: dying orchards → mineral leaching → silk sealing → restoration, yet the night's labor unfolds without reversal or tightening that narrows options. Orientation anchors early (Veyra, Elias, orchards, forge). The drive lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture (the silk's history, the mines' secrets), held adequately but the ending summarizes consequence rather than showing a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Kael), where (repair bay), and when (present, dream-led) within the opening. The causal lens is signaled through scanner readings and the alternate Kael's arrival, but the closure unit—"Kael made his decision"—withholds the decisive change itself, leaving the cost implied rather than dramatized. The piece teaches a hybrid accumulative/causal pattern (dreams→nexus→gate→choice) that holds through midpoint, but the final beat offers charged poise without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid. One meaningful tightening occurs when the other Kael activates the gate, narrowing options, but the ending stops short of legible closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: stones accumulate, notes layer, the lamp is relit, and the final note reweights prior material. However, the closure—"didn't feel alone in the dark"—reads as emotional summary rather than a concrete image that makes cost undeniable. The reversal (stones rearranged, final note) happens off-page, undermining agency and felt consequence at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is clear (who, where, when established early). The piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the vision sequence and the final image reweights the premise. However, the closure unit—Veyra's decision to "step into the light"—is asserted in future tense without a visible, felt cost paid on the page; the vision's emergence feels passive, and no prior constraint is dramatized as foreclosed by this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory texture and metaphoric recurrence (morpho wing, light trails, map symbols) toward a final image where the map shimmers. Orientation is anchored early (tea house, dye master, valley). However, the closure lacks felt cost—the search ending feels like intellectual recognition rather than a foreclosed path or stake reweighted with pressure. The night conversation and dawn map transformation offer a tonal shift but no decisive action or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors slowly (tower, storm, labyrinth worker) but the "who" crystallizes adequately by the sextant discovery. The piece accumulates imagery (offerings, whispers, moonlight healing, trees as witnesses) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tower becomes "keeper of dreams" and sorrow "made whole." Cost remains abstract—the healing and acceptance don't foreclose a live path on the page; the pin's click recurs but doesn't tighten options. The ending reweights the premise but the conceptual cost (what Elias gives up to remain) is implied rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (greenhouse → seed → song → dawn) with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the song reweights the realm's possibility. Cost is visible in Elara's raw throat and the villagers' hesitant joining, and the ending image (dawns creeping across sky) reconfigures the opening's "endless night." However, the keeper's exposition dumps weaken causal momentum in the middle third, and the villagers' instant participation after one verse lacks friction or a meaningful reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal-Hybrid: the invitation triggers memory, memory reweights the puzzle, and Elias's decision to leave enacts a Decisive Change with visible cost (he abandons his post, steps into the unknown). The invitation's paradoxical message and the map inside *The Art of Vanishing* create because/therefore links. However, the closure cost—leaving the library—is legible but not deeply felt; we see him step out, but the story stops before consequences land, reducing the weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: frost, city, bakery's absence by paragraph two. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrue (bakery, bread, courtyard, seeds, planting) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias plants seeds, enacting "absolution" as "grown" with conceptual cost (accepting erasure, choosing small persistence). The cost is legible in the act and the image of "tenuous" hope. No causal break mars closure, and the tightening from observation to action is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal-accumulative hybrid: Elias finds the slide, measures its frequencies, activates it, and commits to preserving the library. The closure is a Charged Poise—he stabilizes the illusion and vows to remember—but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture on the page. The orientation is clean and the structure is coherent, though the final beat would benefit from a more tangible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with Situational accent; orientation anchors who/where/when by line 4. The escalation (bumped man → guttered lantern → knife confrontation) narrows options through because/therefore linkage. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lena accepts she's only delayed betrayal, foreclosing the path of full prevention with felt cost. The watch fob's return at the end charges the final image, and the truce-as-constraint shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative hybrid: the convergence of Elara and the storm-man under the aurora crystallizes the story's central question. Orientation anchors (Lavender Bluff, aurora, forests) arrive early. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara watches the trees march and tightens her grip, but no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallized with felt price. The encounter delivers exposition about "emergent compass" and "terrestrially cosmic" without dramatized consequence, reducing the ending to thematic assertion rather than reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation is anchored early (cave, artist, lock), and the dream-to-waking pattern is legible. However, closure lacks felt cost: Elias simply opens the lock and steps forward without trade-off, tension, or consequence. The phrase "he had found the way to bring them home" tells rather than shows what changes, and no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a prior path. Under a Causal lens, the lock-opening feels coincidental rather than earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a causal chain (fragment → map → archives → staircase) but ends on threshold discovery rather than closure with cost. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly, and the drive lens reads as causal through the middle, but the ending offers setup for further action instead of a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. No cost is legible on the page at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of symbolic gathering and transformation early (iceberg fragment → sculpture song) and deepens it (glass orb → sapphire lattice). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the stake—preserving wonder's colors—and the cost is conceptual (the orb's destruction, the ephemeral nature of the fragment melting). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias breaks the orb, intensifying the sculpture's song and reweighting the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (android caretaker, glass dome rose farm, magnetic shift timeline). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Eli kneels in ash, understanding the roses never needed him—a renunciation that forecloses his caretaker role with visible cost (the farm burned, his fears destroyed). The cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when he opens the box and lets the static scream out, shifting from containment to release. Minor causality softness: the magnetic north's repeated shifts frame the piece but do not mechanically trigger the burn decision; the linkage reads more atmospheric than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is solid by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara gathers story fragments that converge when Clara opens the mailbox. However, the closure unit—Clara reading the letter and Elara nodding in silent acknowledgment—delivers resonance without a legible cost to Elara or a visible transformation in her options or stance. The "sandstorm calm" final image gestures at Charged Poise, but no persistent constraint or forfeited path is made concrete on the page. Causality between beats is clean but the closure effect feels summative rather than reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (Elara, sinking lab, dice on console). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyric density and motif recurrence (dice, journal, dance, water) build toward the chamber revelation. However, closure fails the cost test: the final image shows Elara stepping into the chamber with "secrets would endure. And so would she," but no on-page change in options, no felt price, no knowledge reweighted by her choice. The discovery is handed to her by Kael's dance cipher and the dice rolls rather than earned through a dilemma that forecloses a path. Without visible cost at closure, Q2 cannot exceed mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. The story teaches its pattern early (lantern ritual, sister's vanishing, whale as vessel) and deepens through layered images (spiral in coffee grounds → journal sketch, gravity fluctuations). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marlowe steps toward the chamber's heart, the whale still singing, with cost implied (wildflowers falling, years of denial ending). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the journal confirms the whale isn't dead and memories persist as echoes. The cost is felt but could be more viscerally foregrounded in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the summoner moves from needing to hush the prophecy to choosing silence for himself), but the cost remains abstract—no concrete path is visibly foreclosed, no tactical option lost. The story unfolds as a sequence of poetic tableaux rather than causal pressure: kneeling, unfolding, releasing, walking away. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when clarify only gradually), and the Drive Lens wavers between Accumulative and Causal without teaching a pattern or landing decisively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (rooftop, Elara, post-Veyra's death, weekly ritual). The causal lens holds: Elara finds the seal → Mira recognizes it → revelation of shared legacy → agreement to act. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the two agree to listen under the meteor shower, crystallizing their shared purpose. However, the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than visibly paid on the page; the "weight of the past finally lifting" tells rather than shows a trade-off or sacrifice in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (Elias, garden, twilight, post-quarantine). The drive lens reads Causal-Situational hybrid: resonance structures materialize Liora, leading to the decision to "let's go." However, closure cost is abstract—"the quarantine was over...because Elias had" changed internally—without showing what path he foreclosed or what tangible price he paid on the page. The seashell warming and structures flaring are vivid images, but the final beat ("Then let's go") lacks a visible sacrifice or constraint that makes the before/after legible with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (calligraphy forger, marble sanctuary, aurora). The causal lens holds: Lian's years of preparation → Vey's arrival → key mechanism → scroll reveal → her choice to walk away. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she steps into light, freeing herself rather than destroying him, and the cost—forfeiting direct vengeance—is felt. One meaningful tightening when Vey confronts her narrows her options to revelation or continued hiding, and she chooses disclosure with restraint. The "door was never meant to be opened—only passed through" moment supplies conceptual repricing, though the metaphor leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece announces a Causal lens ("The shell was the key") but delivers Accumulative texture without a decisive change. Liora follows vibrations, encounters Veyan, learns the shell's nature, and they sing—no choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The ending reconfigures the cosmology ("no longer a secret, but a story") but lacks visible cost: we see no one called back, no price paid, only assertion. Orientation is clear early, preventing deeper penalties, but closure remains conceptual rather than dramatized with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers a Hybrid lens (accumulative dream-fragments building toward a situational final encounter). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (shrine, glacier, snow globe). The closure—Mara's conversation with the red-coated woman and her decision to keep the secret—lands on the page, but the cost is more declared ("Some wrecks were meant to stay buried") than felt through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. The week of descendant visits compresses causality into summary, weakening the because/therefore chain that would earn the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details (rain, mist, fireflies) and the moon-path motif layer toward a lyric resolution. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes Ren and Mei together, patterns "finally make sense"—but the cost is implied rather than dramatically legible on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by early paragraphs). The causality is loose: Mei's arrival is coincidental, not motivated by prior pressure, and the sketch she produces feels like a deus ex machina rather than an earned turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The closure unit—Elias viewing truth through the diamond—lands on the page but the cost remains conceptual only; no visible price (relational, tactical, or opportunity) is paid in the final image. The stranger's appearance and instant alliance breaks motivated linkage; their earlier shredding of letters "to be reassembled" contradicts their role as silencer. One meaningful tightening occurs (letters → stillpoint → diamond) but the final beat delivers confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story signals a causal lens (Elias hears voices → descends → confronts Kael → crowd wavers) but key linkages are elided or summarized: how he "unfolds" the shadows, what specific act makes the crowd see them, and whether Kael's faltering changes Elias's situation remain unclear on the page. Closure lands as the crowd turns and "the world was listening," a shift in stance, but the cost is implied rather than felt—no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical sacrifice marks the ending. The thirty-year backstory and reflective blocks exceed the BRR default without anchoring present micro-choices that tilt his stance; this flattens escalation without triggering a separate Q7 penalty, so I apply −0.3 here and note the cap ripple below.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (vagrant poet, dunes loft, dawn), satisfying the test. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: melody → jars → girl → epiphany, deepening through accretion rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias names his role as "translator between generations"), but the cost is conceptual rather than visible—no on-page foreclosure or felt price in the final beat. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where Elias sacrifices an option or pays a concrete price at closure, triggering a −0.6 deduction and capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and establishes a causal lens: Elias's choice to use the lighthouse beacon creates the opening for him to claim the key. The closure—touching the key and experiencing transformed guilt—lands on the page with felt cost ("so cold it burned," guilt "became something bearable"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the scavenger's tuning fork shatters, narrowing options. Minor slips: the scavenger's blood trickling from her ears arrives without prior setup of sonic harm to humans, creating a small causality soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density ("hum," "ozone and wet stone") and the stranger's arrival layer pressure toward the shared acknowledgment at closure. However, the final handshake and turn toward the lake constitute a Charged Poise moment whose cost is asserted ("quiet certainty of the tides") rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, no tactical shift, no visible price paid in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is prompt (tunnel, investigator, lantern by paragraph four), and the Drive Lens reads Causal. The closure—Elias sends evidence and steps forward with the lantern—lands on the page, but cost remains abstract: no trade-off dramatized, no visible consequence. The reversal (overhearing Voss's conspiracy) arrives through eavesdropping rather than protagonist agency. The lantern "reignited in his hand" functions as a symbolic gesture without altering tactics or foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a causal drive: Elias discovers evidence suggesting Hargrove's innocence, seeks expert confirmation, and commits to action. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraphs. The closure—Elias's decision to "prove it" and step into the storm—lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (his vocation now demands action over absolution), though the final image leans more declarative than viscerally reweighted. The three-month flashback introduces a minor causality seam but does not break the through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens with clear escalation: Elias works faster as the workshop dies, completes the bell, rings it, and receives an impossible response. The closure—"it heard us"—lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the world's rules have shifted), though the cost remains implicit rather than viscerally felt. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, tonight) arrive early and hold. One minor causality slip: the arrow tip is "fitted" into the bell's final gear with no prior setup of its mechanical role.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when promptly and follows a causal chain: patch → numbers → hidden folder → video → decision to copy. The escalation narrows from mystery to revelation, and Lena's final act (copying the file, choosing a side) constitutes a Decisive Change with implied professional and personal cost. However, the cost remains conceptual—no on-page consequence materializes, and the video reveal lands as exposition rather than a dramatized confrontation that alters tactics mid-scene. The lens reads Causal with a late tilt toward Situational (stance crystallization), held adequately but not tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early enough. The closure—crystal shattering the beast—arrives on the page, but the cost is unclear: Elias exhales and his shadows recede with no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The lens reads as attempted Causal (fragment → beast dissolved) but the middle beats (mirrors showing visions, trees bending aside) function as situational complications without because/therefore linkage, creating lens drift. The child's final line ("You reconstituted the light") asserts thematic payoff without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from tourist detachment to engaged witness through density build and the parasol's charged return. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias takes the clipboard, accepting the role with the final image reweighting prior material—salt, thawing ice, and the shift from tourist to participant. Cost is felt (he stays, forfeiting his original intent) though somewhat muted. One meaningful deepening is present.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Liora at the pavilion, post-bus departure, awaiting Elias. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—her reach and his smile reconfigure their relationship with visible emotional cost ("You hurt me" / "I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make it right"). The causal lens holds: letter arrival → her wait → his arrival → confrontation → tentative reconciliation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she voices the hurt and he accepts accountability, narrowing options toward forgiveness or final separation. Cost is legible in her admission and his vow, though the speed of emotional pivot from years of hurt to lifted weight slightly undercuts the price.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pavilion murmurs → clearing → thread). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the line walker grasps his role as conduit and the thread remains, reweighting "consecrate" from mystery to transmission. Cost is conceptual but legible—he must let wisdom pass through rather than hoard it. The piece teaches its pattern early (murmurs, peripheral awareness, kinetic parapet) and the final image charges prior motifs. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception; he realizes rather than decides, and no live option is foreclosed on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (confusion → understanding via the thread), meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the lack of a visible price or tactic shift keeps this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchors (lavender field, factory ruins) and follows an accumulative lens as Elias arranges photographs toward a moment of personal insight. However, the closure—his realization that "the masterpiece was not just the arrangement of photographs, but the act of creating it"—reads as a thematic statement rather than a decisive change with visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, and the ending dove flight feels ornamental rather than causal. The story teaches a reflective, meditative mode early, but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt pressure or reconfigure Elias's situation in a way that creates legible before/after stakes. Under the accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift that charges the ending image is required; here the ending restates the theme without tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    **Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural.** Orientation anchors who/where/when by opening lines. The piece accumulates density through repeated crystal interactions (whisper, hum, temple press) and the final conceptual repricing: gardens "weren't mutating; they were remembering." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the crystal as witness and the library as court, reweighting the premise of growth as recorded sound-memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when he hears the heartbeat pattern. Cost is conceptual—the weight of discovery—but the final image ("promise") feels more hopeful setup than felt closure with sacrifice. Meets accumulative lens but cost legibility is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative lens early (fog sculptures, scattered images, memory motifs) and attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the videotape reveal and the chalk/driftwood spiral closure. Orientation anchors—junkyard prophet, fog garden, driftwood—arrive within the first 120 words and remain stable. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost: he pockets the tape and steps forward, but no option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid, no before/after distinction beyond receiving information he'll forget again. The spiral completion and the stone inscription feel like staged set-pieces rather than pressure-driven discoveries. The lens holds (accumulative/textural), but the final image reweights meaning only conceptually—"this time, he won't forget" contradicts the established curse without dramatizing how the tape changes his capacity or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and metaphor build toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit—Elias escaping with the photograph as the observatory falls—offers reconfiguration but the cost is primarily external (station loss) rather than a felt trade-off that reweights his quest. The "ephemeral made eternal" repricing is asserted in the final beat but not charged by prior on-page stakes or sacrifice. One meaningful deepening (camera restructure) occurs, but causality between the modification and the photograph's "streak of light" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors (hospice room, post-blood-work call, twilight progression). Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vinyl shard recurs with reweighted meaning, and the song performance deepens the "scent of hope" motif into a charged goodbye. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lena's peaceful death and the reunified shards offer a before/after with felt cost (loss of the friend, acceptance of brokenness holding song). The cost is legible in Elias's "throat tight" and his vigil until twilight. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena hands over her shard, crystallizing the friendship and mortality stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens through the key-mechanism-guardian sequence, and the mirrors-shattering moment offers a Decisive Change with shadows restored. However, the cost remains abstract: what does Liora forfeit or risk by closing the loop? The guardian's "Then close the loop" instruction arrives without prior setup of what that phrase means, creating a minor causality gap. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure lands on the page, but the felt or visible price—required for high-band entry—is not legible in a concrete sentence or image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Lena, garden behind hedge maze, after the substitute body. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the teeth, the map, the maze all deepen rather than narrow causally, and the ending crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "together, they walked back" with the implication that Lena can now keep the changeling). Cost is felt—she accepts the strangeness the town cannot—but the phrasing "some constellations were meant to be seen only by those who knew where to look" borders on stating the theme rather than embodying it. The closure lands cleanly under the lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Liora descends, retrieves the pearl, and returns with a new understanding. Orientation anchors clearly (grotto, Liora, present quest). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the pearl pulses outward, the village waits, and the final image reweights her prior failure with a felt cost (she now carries memories without being consumed). One meaningful deepening occurs when she touches the pearl and the world stills, reframing her approach to light. The cost is felt but slightly abstract; the line "they no longer weighed her down" tells rather than showing the exact forfeiture or tradeoff at the closure beat, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: observation → revelation → shared ritual. Orientation anchors quickly (Elias, data center, post-confession timeframe). The notebook reveal provides a meaningful tightening that narrows Mira's defensive options, and the pendant's final placement offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the siblings crystallize a shared acknowledgment with visible emotional cost. The because/therefore chain is clean: Elias watches → documents → confronts → they release together. Minor slip: "honeyed hush" as closure phrase reads slightly imposed rather than emerging organically from prior concrete work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by ~80 words (who, where, what he seeks). The lens reads accumulative/textural: sensory density and cameo pattern build pressure toward the protagonist-ghost confrontation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias accepts that hopes are fleeting and commits to watching—but the cost is asserted ("All he had to do was keep watching") rather than dramatized. The river's insistence and the protagonist's demand ("Then learn") gesture at stakes, but the final wade-back lacks visible forfeiture or a tactical shift that makes the before/after legible with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Liora, arbor, dawn, tendril). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the arbor hums, spirals glow, warmth spreads—density and pattern intensify toward the golden-light climax. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora understands the remedy, the arbor remembers, and she walks toward the village with new song trembling on her lips—options reconfigured with palpable cost (she must now persuade skeptics). One meaningful deepening occurs when the song unlocks the glow. Cost is felt but slightly abstract—her social risk is declared more than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early: slow arrangement, sensory stacking, and ritual pacing build toward the origami jar's glow as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure image—starlight safekept "in the stillness between his own heartbeats"—reweights the dominant stake (preserving the pause) with conceptual cost (he must let the moment go to hold it). One meaningful deepening occurs when the flash-paper jar materializes and settles, crystallizing options. Causality is slight but consistent with the textural lens; no unmotivated leaps harm the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated attempts with the timer, chalk marks, quartz adjustments, culminating in the boy-reflection and the timer's restart. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (realization that wonder must be released, not stored) with conceptual cost (abandoning his months-long project's original purpose). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure image is legible but the cost remains largely conceptual and asserted ("trusting the echoes") rather than foregrounding a visible forfeiture or tactical shift that the prior causality forced.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a Conceptual Repricing lens: burdens materialize, are understood, then dissolve, reweighting Liora's relationship to sorrow. Orientation anchors early (bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, Liora's purpose), and the closure image—"the sound was no longer a whisper. It was a song"—attempts to reconfigure meaning. However, the cost is more asserted than legible: we're told she's lighter, but the price of understanding (risk of calcification, the weight she carried in) is never dramatized as foreclosing a path or altering her options. The causality is thin—match struck, burdens appear, burdens vanish—without a visible tightening or choice that narrows her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by ~80 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through density increase (reflection on grief, steam imagery, carving strokes) toward a cadence shift in the final paragraph where the "rust-hued peace...felt like enough" reweights the dominant stake. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara stops trying to escape or harvest lessons and accepts holding what cannot be contained—a stance crystallization with felt cost (relinquishing the pursuit of meaning-making). The reflexive bulk (~35%) anchors in present stimuli (wood grain, kettle whistle, carving knife) and tilts present stance through the micro-choice to carve, satisfying BRR exception tests.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (scavenger, rusted platform, kinetic lagoon) land clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the scavenger moves from collection to confrontation to listening, with the ghost encounter serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration moment. However, the cost at closure is conceptual and felt rather than visible—"let the wind carry the weight away" gestures toward release but does not foreclose a path on the page with a concrete action or renunciation. The camera wheel's disappearance into the lagoon functions as a micro turn but the final "now you listen" directive remains abstract, making the closure image more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through water/greenery pattern, and the final sketching act reweights the assessment task into a blueprint for resilience. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the terminal shifts from ruin to beginning), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; Mara forfeits nothing on the page, and the woman's gesture ("take it") lands as gift rather than trade-off. The sextant's return at the end charges the image, yet the escalation from discovery to encounter feels more like reveal than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. The causal lens holds through the music-box repair, but the bear's appearance introduces a coincidental complication that resolves the protagonist's stasis without dramatized agency—Elias follows passively. The closure at the forecourt offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (making peace with the past), yet the cost is told in summary ("let himself remember") rather than shown through a forfeited option or tangible sacrifice. The ending lands as reflection, not a decisive on-page change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "errant legend seeker" reads more as archetype than name. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes symbolic weight (sundial, mirror, reflection) toward a final image. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist recognizes himself "as he might have been"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after materially legible. The needle "pointing at the reflection" recharges prior material, yet the final beat ("the truth he had always carried") tells rather than dramatizes the reweighting, reducing felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (Elias, dock, fog, rope). The piece accumulates sensory density and knotwork detail but lacks a decisive change or renunciation with visible cost. The ending offers discovery (Weeping Shoals name, a flicker in the water) but no choice that forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt pressure. The closure reads as continuation rather than reconfiguration; the cost of pursuit or preservation remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Lena's repeated acts of writing obituaries for the vanished accumulate into the garden ritual, which deepens her understanding of grief's movement. The closure—imagining the thread growing roots to bind the fractured kingdom—reconfigures her prior abstractions into a charged image of futile hope with felt cost ("a foolish hope… but it was all she had"). One meaningful tightening occurs when she kneels and presses the thread into soil, narrowing her tactic from observation to symbolic action. Cost is legible in "let them swallow her whole," signaling exhaustion and self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Kaelen's attempts escalate from mechanical to remembered song, culminating in the egg's hatching. Orientation anchors promptly (suspended palace, prince, egg by paragraph four). The closure—hatching via sung memory—lands with visible cost (years of failed mechanical work, weeping acknowledgment of flawed method). One meaningful tightening occurs when the contraption's failure forces the turn to lullabies, and the final image reweights the premise with the bird's silence and lean, a Charged Poise that makes the cost felt even as hope emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated sensory touchstones (lagoon, coin, black sand, clouds) gather toward a final image. However, no decisive tightening occurs—Lena arrives reflective and departs reflective with the same stance. The girl's arrival is coincidental and does not narrow options or deepen cost; the ending image ("the lagoon held them all—past, present, and the promise of peace") restates the opening mood without visible or felt cost. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a foreclosed path or paid price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Situational-leaning-Accumulative: breadcrumbs and memory imagery build pressure toward the fountain reveal and descent. Closure is a Charged Poise moment (the door opening to light), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing precedes the descent. The grandmother's late appearance and quick dissolution feel like scaffolding rather than earned causality. Orientation anchors (Elara, fountains, dawn box) land early, waiving the Orientation Test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through recurring images (petals, sonar, gear, light/fire opposition) and the closure reweights the opening premise with a resonant final image. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; when remains poetic but legible. The ending achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): "The cycle wasn't broken. But for the first time, it felt like it could be" crystallizes a stance with felt cost (acceptance of pattern continuity while offering new possibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when the gear's activation causes Kael's weapons to power down, narrowing tactical options. Cost is visible in Elias's acceptance that the cycle persists even as he seeds change.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: weekly visits deepen connection through ribbon, poem, and memory until the final reweighting. Orientation anchors quickly (Elias, workshop, Eldermere). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias drapes the ribbon as a communal banner and recites the poem, crystallizing collective grief—with conceptual cost (renouncing private mourning, opening the space to others). The lens holds and the final image recharges prior material, but the spectral voice and poem feel convenient rather than earned by prior causality, lowering the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: guilt inscriptions accumulate across years, the pendulum's pause signals imbalance, and the final transfer reweights the bob's swing with shared burden. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the pendulum resumes, Elias is unburdened), and the cost is visible—he surrenders the inscribed handle to the sea. Orientation anchors quickly (obsidian ridge, Elias, pendulum whisper). One meaningful deepening occurs when he presses each name into the brass, escalating from discovery to ritual action. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation anchors are delayed: the silo's function and Elias's role emerge gradually, but "who, where, when" coalesce past ~120 words without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern. The chess-clock phrase is seeded but never reweights options on the page; it remains metaphorical. The ending offers a gesture (planting roses, listening to echoes) but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing—Elias's stance and options read identical before and after the tapestry discovery. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece oscillates between accumulative texture (threads, names, objects) and a causal investigation that resolves into contemplation rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when efficiently and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—building density through the act of writing. However, the closure lacks legible cost: Elara completes the task, the scholars will "prevail," and the world is "waiting." No option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The phrase "if she had done her job well" hedges the outcome rather than crystallizing it. The predictive model is mentioned but its mechanics never constrain a choice or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias gathers fragments (radio song, dust) until the final image where dust speaks. However, the closure unit—dust forming the word "Listen"—arrives without visible cost; Elias laughs and plans to continue, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The linkage from song lyrics to dust-weaving feels asserted rather than causally earned, and the "maybe the world would hear them" remains speculative rather than a felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: gallery objects (chair, mask, portrait) recur with shifting meaning toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure unit—Elias seeing his own face and scattering ashes—reconfigures the "hiding" theme, but the causal bridge from mask-vision to self-portrait resolution feels thin; the vision tells him his mother was "trying to outrun" an emotion, yet the mechanics of how incomplete information leads to his face appearing remain assertion rather than demonstrated pressure. Cost is felt (he drops the mask, walks away) but the conceptual repricing lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal/Situational hybrid—Elias's investigation builds toward a decision to surface. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure is a Charged Poise moment: stepping into the unknown with his findings, options reconfigured. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page consequence dramatizes what he loses or risks by leaving the sewer; the final image gestures toward stakes without making the price undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs (the decision to go public), but the escalation is more cumulative reflection than a because/therefore chain that narrows tactical options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present (velvet library, autumn, choir) though the transition from "she had come to this town" to "the choir she inherited" creates mild temporal wobble. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the zither's presence and recurring rehearsals build toward the final hand-touch and "vanishing arts being remembered." However, the closure lacks visible or felt cost—the transformation is asserted ("by the seventh...") rather than shown in a decisive beat, and the final paragraph's "allowed herself to hope" reads as summary rather than a reweighted image. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence demonstrates what Miss Voss sacrificed or lost to achieve this harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the greenhouse setting and memory motif accumulate toward a final vision and seed-harvest closure. Orientation anchors (rusted greenhouse, Chef Mara, abandoned gardens) arrive early. However, the climactic fruit-eating beat—the story's natural Decisive Change—delivers a memory-vision then immediately fades, leaving Mara "gasping on the greenhouse floor" with no on-page cost or trade-off; she gains wholeness and keeps the remaining seeds, flattening the stakes. The ending ("she had found her own kind of magic") reads as thematic summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt pressure, and the celestial alignment functions as backdrop timer without tightening tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (toll keeper, tower, post-blackout) arrive early and hold. The causal chain—box found, riddle decoded, tower core drained, match restores hives—reads cleanly, but the escalation is thin: Elias and Maren slip past the gate with no obstacle, find the core, and the solution (strike a match) is handed to them by the riddle itself. The closure is a Decisive Change (hives revive), yet the cost is conceptual only ("someone didn't want us to fix this") and not felt or paid by Elias in a way that forecloses a path or alters his stance. Maren's final murmur about sabotage opens a question rather than landing resonance, weakening the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece reads under an Accumulative lens: the bay's silence, houses breathing, orris root, and streetlights daydreaming build a coherent pattern of uncanny domesticity that pays off when the house pauses and exhales. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the house's resumption reweights Elias's quest, and the cost (walking away without answers, knowing some questions aren't meant to be answered) is legible. Orientation anchors appear promptly (Elias, bay, dock). One weakness: the core causal turn (shard inserted → house pauses → exhales) happens largely off-stage; Elias hears the shape of a breath but the dramatized consequence is atmospheric rather than a choice-altering pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: the diver presses the ampoule, triggering physical and conceptual change (the tendrils, the revelation that gardeners were jailers), and she becomes "part of its next chapter"—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (her mission inverted, her certainty shattered). The causal lens holds cleanly through the statute's revelations narrowing her options. Orientation anchors are present early (garden, statue, diver, ampoule) and the cost is legible in the violet light and her realization. Minor: the final paragraph's "weight of what it meant to truly understand" edges toward theme statement rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure: Elias seeks to rupture infinity and discovers adaptability instead of limits. However, the closure cost is conceptual but not felt—the staircase shifts but Elias simply continues climbing with no dramatized forfeiture, altered tactic, or emotional price. The dice roll functions as a micro turn but doesn't narrow options in a way that charges the final image with undeniable pressure. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Conceptual) holds but the ending reconfiguration feels told rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (painter, greenhouse, smog, night) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates through painting-as-ritual and moon-charged reflection, but the closure—rolling up paintings and planning to distribute them—remains preparatory rather than decisive. No on-page cost accompanies the final act; the "quiet certainty" is declared, not earned through a visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: dying arts, the opera glass visions, the unfinished tapestry, and the baking ritual build toward a pattern-break closure when the bees return. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure—bees returning after the bread is baked—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the dying arts waiting, not gone), but the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page. The link between baking one loaf and the bees' return reads as convenient coincidence rather than earned causality, softening the closure's inevitability. One meaningful tightening occurs (dream to bakery to museum), sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the yoyo's rising, the stone's glow, and the world's reversal build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image—lighthouse beam casting backward, yoyo falling but "the hunger stone remembered"—reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors appear by the second paragraph (Elias, lighthouse, tide). One meaningful deepening occurs when the yoyo "unwound" and the stone split, crystallizing the reversal of time itself. Cost is conceptual—Elias has altered causality—but the exact price (what he sacrificed or risked) remains oblique; "weight of time not as a chain, but as a choice" gestures at cost without specifying a forfeited option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal-Situational hybrid: Elias enters to confront fear, the mirror lunges, he presses his palm, and the reflection recoils—a tightening that narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change (the mirror becomes inert, cloak discarded, face unmarred in the new photo) with visible cost (the advisor vanishes, the cloak left behind). Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. The turn feels neat; the reflection's terror and shattering ice deliver cost, but the ease of resolution—one touch silences the threat—undercuts escalation weight.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation (who, where, when) lands cleanly within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens is evident: rhythmic layering builds toward the climactic mallet strike and sky-glowing resonance. However, closure lacks legible cost—the world "sings back" and Leeward is "heard," but no prior option is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes with felt price. The ending reads as pure escalation without the decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing required on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Mira's investigation of the crack leads to the tunnel, the cavern, and the transformed expedition, which then drives her flight and final decision to map all cracks. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs. The closure—Mira boarding the ship to find more cracks—reads as Charged Poise: options are crystallized (she will pursue the fractures despite the cost), and the cost is felt (she now knows the watchers' secret and the expedition's fate). One deduction: the expedition's transformation is revealed but not causally linked to Mira's earlier actions, creating a small gap in earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The drive lens reads as Causal: Elias's choice to preserve both forgery and confession alters the letter's legacy with a felt cost to historical purity. Liora's arrival provides a reversal that tests his stance, and the ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration—the letter will be displayed with both truths, reweighting the premise of "noble lies." One cap: the Liora confrontation resolves via mutual understanding rather than a harder-won turn, softening the final cost slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias recognizes his role and the pavilion is no longer alone. However, the cost is oblique—no visible forfeiture or changed tactic on the page. The progression is more accumulative witnessing than causal pressure; each note deepens tone but does not narrow options or force a decision that alters what follows. The inkwell empties, but that depletion was inevitable rather than a trade-off under duress. Lens: Accumulative/Textural held to closure, but the final image reweights the premise without palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elias searches → finds ledger → discovers family name → reconfigures his understanding. However, the closure lacks felt cost; he "smiles" and chooses to stay, but no option is visibly foreclosed and no prior path is renounced with pressure. The blackout bookends (swallows/ends) frame the piece but don't constrain tactics. The ledger's survival "decades after the city's supposed fall" introduces a mystery the story doesn't resolve or use to tighten pressure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by early paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern or cadence shift that reweights the stake. Orientation is delayed—who Veyra is and what she wants emerge gradually through reflection rather than anchored action. The closure unit (light coiling, world transforming) gestures at Conceptual Repricing but the cost is atmospheric rather than legible: what exactly changed, what was foreclosed, what price did she pay? The story describes a process (lantern-making, dream-polishing, shattering) without a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, though the "three years since the strike" backstory competes with present action. The piece reads as accumulative/textural—grief pooling, the geode pulsing, fragments of the past colliding with the present—but the ending ("The hunt wasn't over. It had only just begun") declares continuation rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The alarms and her running exit constitute a micro turn but not a closure effect that reweights prior material. Cost is implied but not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (observatory, Elias, pilgrim, dusk). The piece reads under a Situational lens: pressure accumulates as the chip pulses, the drone reveals the star trail, and the station appears, culminating in the pilgrim's invitation. Closure is Charged Poise—the call won't wait, options crystallize—but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what specific path Elias forecloses by powering down the drone and following her. The tightening is present but the price is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias takes the key and breaks the watch hand, crystallizing his shift from running to chasing truth with visible forfeit of his memorial anchor. The drive lens reads Causal with one meaningful tightening when the uncle reveals the symbol and offers the key. The uncle's exposition arrives cleanly motivated by the driftwood discovery, though the revelation's ease undercuts the cost slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly; the exchange setup is clear. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: mist, moon phases, drawer pull, and parapet recur to build atmosphere. However, closure is weak—the ending offers mood and motion ("turned toward the path") but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The prisoners never arrive on the page, the heirloom/spymaster swap dissolves into setup, and the final image ("Some mistakes were recycled into wisdom") is assertion rather than earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (coastal kayak launch, dawn, Elias). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered reflection, physical movement, and recurring images (compass, poles, tide) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elias's hurling of the compass is an Earned Stasis that forecloses the father's path with visible cost. The tightening is legible: paddling to open water, gravitating to the island, then the decisive throw. Cost is visible on the page in the compass swallowed by water and the final image of acceptance. One micro turn (the kayak gravitating to the island) sets up the closure without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lake glow, baseball signature, mirror-memories build density toward a final realization. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (who, underground location, bioluminescent lake). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—"the labyrinth wasn't just a maze. It was a mirror"—that reweights the premise, but the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price undeniable in the final image. The left/right tunnel choice and chamber of mirrors deepen the motif but don't narrow Elias's options in a way that forecloses a live path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors (orchard, Liora, post-phoenix timeframe) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ritual gathers density through sensory layering (spices, scent, phoenix pyre) and culminates in the bird-transformation image that reweights the fortune's promise. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Liora accepts the new form "not as it had been, but as it needed to be," foreclosing the path to human resurrection. Felt cost is present—she must "let him go" as he was—but the final beat lands gently without friction or visible sacrifice that tightens options on the page. The pattern holds; one meaningful deepening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (midnight glade above clouds, cartomancer, post-birth timeframe), and the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cartomancer spreads the cloth, traces the crack, aligns her palm with her younger self, and in the final image lets her hands rest where ink meets cloth and crack meets sky—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights "lost time" as "what endures." Cost is legible in the image of the crack pulsing "warm as a heartbeat" and her not flinching, though the pressure is felt more than causally narrowed. The piece does not escalate through because/therefore linkage but through density increase and cadence shift, which fits the inferred lens. However, the middle section loops through multiple restatements of the same thematic territory (the nature of names, the debt of promises, the cruelty and mercy of unseen things) without a clear turn or deepening until the final alignment, resulting in a closure that lands but arrives via summary more than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sorrow through photograph beats and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ship enters the dimension; Liora remains, lighter). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure image—ship dissolving, Liora floating, locket empty—reweights prior material with felt cost (solitude, emptiness). One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket warms and she realizes she must "become the wound," narrowing her path to self-sacrifice. The causal step from stitching memories to opening the dimension relies on metaphor more than dramatized mechanism, but the lens accommodates pattern-driven intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a situational lens where coincidence and prophecy complicate rather than resolve, but the closure—Elias running to warn the village—lands primarily as externalized action without visible cost or stance crystallization on the page. The woman's cracked-mirror vision functions as exposition that tells Elias what will happen rather than forcing him to choose under pressure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~100 words). The detour functions as setup but the prophetic mechanism resolves the stakes rather than Elias's prior orchestration of coincidences, weakening causal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~120 words. The story follows a causal arc: Mira discovers the parchment → realizes the governor's plan → lights a signal torch → leaves. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Mira simply executes her plan and walks away with no on-page consequence or meaningful reconfiguration. The revolution is asserted to "burn on its own," but we don't witness a decisive change in Mira's options or stance—she completes her task cleanly and exits. The final image ("Somewhere, a lock clicked open. Somewhere, a spark caught.") gestures at thematic resonance but remains abstract rather than grounding cost in Mira's body or immediate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and motif layering (aurora, eels, star dust, painted rocks) build toward a moment where friction returns and the promise is kept. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the world is mended, the debt paid), and the cost is legible in "the weight in his chest lighter now, the promise kept." However, the cost reads more as relief than foreclosure—no path is visibly closed, no sacrifice dramatized—so the closure effect is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece signals a Conceptual Repricing lens—Elias seeks understanding of scars-as-map and concludes that carrying is the point—but the closure image (star visible, silence "full of things he could not yet name") asserts reweighting without demonstrable cost; we do not see what path he foreclosed or what tactical shift the realization forces. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The photograph revelation (scars form a map) occurs on-page but functions as confirmation of what he already suspected rather than a reversal that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive adequately (glass atrium, Elias, Isolde, duel setup by ~100 words). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (recurring symbolic objects, atmosphere, metaphorical convergence), but escalation remains thin: the needle card is introduced, aligned once, then the "duel" ends without a decisive turn that narrows options. Closure reads as Charged Poise—"The duel was over. The journey had just begun"—but cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; no path is visibly foreclosed, no resource spent, no social or conceptual price made undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (causal backstory → accumulative present → situational stance crystallization) and delivers Charged Poise as closure: Lumen's stance shifts from vagrant to builder with the library as the charged space. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (vagrant poet, rusted library, night). The cost is felt but oblique—he stops molting, begins rebuilding—yet the price of this commitment (what he forfeits, what vulnerability he accepts) remains under-dramatized. The Elias reunion provides external validation rather than a causally earned complication, softening the protagonist's agency at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (music, arbor groaning, clouds parting, clock ticking build density toward a cadence shift). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias plays the discordant piece, the arbor responds with waves and stilled compasses, and the broken clock begins to tick—reconfiguring the stasis with felt cost (he's thrown himself into wildness, trusting fate). One meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from practiced nocturnes to the unprecedented piece. Cost is legible in the final image (clock ticking, compasses stilled, waves crashing). The lens holds without contradiction, though the film-reel setup and the exact mechanism of the "loophole" remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (Liora, ridge, reality checker role, monsoon deadline). The closure unit—Liora learning the monsoon's true nature and deciding to tell the village—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "some truths needed time to grow" hedges the decision without visible consequence. The causal lens holds through dream → seed planting → revelation, yet the final stance ("for the first time, she wasn't afraid") tells rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening (the dream revealing the bargain) is present, but the aftermath deflates rather than charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: memories surface through the lace, and the compass guides by "tides of remembrance." The closure—Elias weaving a lace thread into the bonsai and smiling—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with forward momentum). The cost is legible: he accepts that the past cannot be undone but can be "diffuse[d]... stitch by stitch." Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, though the final beat's metaphoric density slightly obscures the precise nature of the reconfiguration.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held flawlessly from the opening dust patterns to the final realization. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the dust is revalued from debris to a map, and her research is repriced from stellar collapse to "slow accumulation." The cost is legible in the line "She didn’t need drama." Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of accretion (dust, flood residue, memory) tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive lens holds tightly: ledger leads to retracing, patterns, confrontation, revelation. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—"the canyon...was also a choice"—with cost legible in the weight of the ledger and the frost's inevitability. Orientation is clear within 120 words; one meaningful tightening (Jaren's confession) escalates cleanly to the ending reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): silence gains a language through the heat-map display. The accumulative lens holds, building imagery to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; the persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics. Cost is legible in the final image—the silence remains, but is reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal plot tightly woven; orientation immediate; closure lands with Earned Stasis, light returning as resonant reconfiguration; cost legible in his trembling-to-stillness arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) under an accumulative/textural lens; the cost is legible in the community's listening amidst worsening sanctions, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: the realization that unused love is stored "in the hands of others." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and reflection. Orientation is clear early; the persistent constraint of the tear shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with felt cost: the photographs restored, fragment gone, and Elara aged. Causal lens holds tightly from fragment discovery to climax, with no orientation debt. The willow doorway transition is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive lens holds tightly from arrow to keys to vault. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of stepping into the dawn with lighter chains reconfigures the stake from survival to growth, with the cost of the collapsing regime legible in the "dying beast’s roar." Orientation is immediate; the puzzle of the keys provides a meaningful, causally-linked tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Elias imprints the foil, accepting it as "enough" despite his terminal condition. Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate; structure (present scene with anchored flashbacks) fits scope and drives to a decisive, cost-weighted end.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly; the train's departure and Kael's reinterpretation force a decisive change (not boarding) with legible cost. Orientation is immediate, and closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration of destiny from stolen to built.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: “Elias no longer feared the thaw.” The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the melting ice and bookmark pattern tightening to reshape his stance. Orientation is solid within 120 words. Persistent constraint (the thaw) shapes the final image. No causality breaks; one meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds tightly: letter→diary→library→clues→confrontation→revelation. Closure is a Decisive Change (truth revealed, offer to start over) with felt cost in the photograph and the caretaker’s choked admission. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. The seashell’s mystical whisper is a permissible story rule that fuels the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds cleanly. Orientation is immediate. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible cost in the final image of weaving and smiling; the compass and lace pattern guide the turn without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear and cohesive: a single accumulative scene in the greenhouse where reflection and sensory detail gradually reweight Elara’s priorities. Causality is modest but coherent—the flood and storm damage reframe her work, leading to her new research focus on dust and accumulation. Closure is a quiet but legible Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she chooses to remain with the dust, accepting a less dramatic but more honest engagement with change. The cost is implied (turning from prestige and spectacle) rather than dramatized, but it’s present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is clear: fire → weeks of retracing → frost patterns and ledger alignment → seeking Jaren → revelation that the whole canyon was targeted → her choice to keep the ledger and reframe the canyon as a choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from seeing the fire as a personal end to understanding a larger plot and her new role. The piece balances present action with well-anchored reflection without losing orientation. Stakes and cost are more implied than dramatized in the final beat but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: brief past (shipwreck and hearing loss) feeds directly into the present experiment in the conservatory, culminating in a successful transformation of silence into a new “music.” Causality is coherent and legible—Elias’s injury → search for solution → learning the device → climactic test of tuning fork and winterglass. The closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: he remains deaf, but the meaning of silence and his options for “hearing” are reweighted. The only limitation is that the path from problem to solution is very smooth, with no meaningful setbacks or structural surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: package → recognition of signal → journey to city → confrontation with the desk of lenses → ritual reading and reactivation. The structure (present action intercut with one concise past visit) is well within scope and clearly anchored, and the closure as a resonant reconfiguration (he becomes a kind of keeper, the light returns as promise rather than beacon) lands. The main weakness is that no turn meaningfully complicates his path—once he decides to go, nothing resists him—so escalation feels more linear than tightening. Still, the piece delivers a coherent before/after with a distinct conceptual shift about what the light is for.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arbor → first bell → donations → midnight runs → second bell and note → children with the bells and the community listening. Causality is coherent and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the bells and ritualized quiet reweighting the community’s situation under sanctions. The main limitation is that the “danger” of patrols and tightened sanctions remains mostly reported rather than dramatized, so the structural turn never quite sharpens into a concrete on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: recent memory → experiment on the viaduct → interruption by father and child → giving away the tear and conceptual realization. Causality holds under a mostly causal/accumulative hybrid lens: the resurfaced past-life memory drives her to the bridge, which sets up the encounter that reconfigures her question about unused love. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the answer about where love is stored is dramatized, then articulated. The only limitation is that the external problem resolves quickly and without friction, softening the sense of risk in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: fragment discovery → experiment on photo → garden’s call → portal → encounter with mother/event → use of fragment → reset with cost. Orientation is excellent; the two-shard structure (garden vs. gaslit street) is clear and easy to follow, and closure (a decisive change with reconfigured reality and personal cost) lands on the page. The main weakness is how conveniently Elara “knows” the fragment’s nature and quickly intuits how to apply it to her mother; the solution feels more told than earned through attempts or discovery. Still, the drive lens holds and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: keys → escape → traverse grounds → scavenger standoff → vault access just as the wall comes down. The story maintains a single coherent drive (reach and secure the vault before others) with no serious orientation issues and a legible before/after: from captivity and rumor to mobility and concrete mission. Closure lands as a mix of Decisive Change (securing the seeds and leaving with them) and Resonant Reconfiguration (reframing secrecy into dissemination), with cost implied in the danger and urgency they’ve just threaded. The only structural softness is that obstacles (especially the scavenger) resolve quickly, keeping escalation from feeling truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: return to greenhouse → consult notes → decide to try the unfinished experiment → imprint his own experience of betrayal. The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, with past and present braided through one continuous scene and culminating in the foil’s imprint and his quiet revaluation of his grandfather’s quest. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes both his grandfather’s life’s work and his own illness through this partial success. The cost (his mortality and the unfixable betrayal) is legible but remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in a concrete turn.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with a clear before/after: Lira arrives to “press her ear against destiny’s door,” meets Kael, then refuses the train to reconfigure what destiny means. Causality is accumulative rather than plotty—conversation, jar’s glow, and train whistle layer into the decision—yet the chain is legible. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she no longer sees herself as a thief but as someone “standing in the light,” with the missed train as the foreclosed path. The cost of that refusal remains mostly conceptual and romanticized, so the structural turn lands more gently than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: one anchored scene in the control room, threaded with reflection, building to the concrete act of powering up the room. Causality is simple but coherent—his dissatisfaction leads him to this refuge, to handling the bookmark, to engaging with the panel, to a new stance toward creation. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from stasis and avoidance to a tentative commitment to “shape something new” under thawing conditions. Stakes remain modest and mostly internal, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear and efficient: shell → desk → cast/notes → floorboard → box → photograph → confrontation/choice. Backstory is compactly threaded and anchored in present objects, keeping orientation solid. Closure lands as a decisive relational and conceptual shift when she chooses to "start over" with the man implicated in her abduction. The main limitation is that the off-page inciting material (letter, diary) is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: storm → shore → fort → hall → completion of the map → altered storm/stance at the end, all under the single-night frame of the dimming star. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she has what she wanted (the map) and chooses not to speak or grasp at the new star, with the booklet sacrificed and her prior drive relinquished. Causality is soft but consistent for a lyric piece; each beat arises logically from the last (stillness of wind → climb to fort → reading → mapping → release). Cost is present but somewhat understated on the page; the loss of the booklet and her vocation as speaking oracle could be edged into sharper relief.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: courtyard → discovery of violin → entry into loops → collapse back to linear time → reoriented cleaning. Causality is soft but legible (touching the violin triggers loops; sustained contact collapses them), and the closure beat provides a clear before/after in E-7X’s stance. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—no external stakes are materially altered—which keeps the impact more meditative than urgent. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, so there’s no structural debt, just relatively low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene that moves cleanly from atmospheric entrance to confrontation to quiet resolution. Causality is straightforward—Mira catches the missing lens, confronts Elias, his secret comes out, and their relationship stance shifts as a result. Closure is solidly a Resonant Reconfiguration: they agree to “start over,” with the projector relighting as a clear before/after image. The main constraint is that the cost of this shift is more implied than dramatically tested on the page, keeping the overall drive on the quieter situational side.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: marbles appear, he tests the garden with them, the garden responds, then offers a map-marble to the seedling, leading to his closing decision. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—taking the seedling, leaving the marbles as breadcrumbs, and accepting that the garden is not his to control—lands as an earned reconfiguration. The cost (relinquishing the fantasy of ownership and legacy control) is clear though quiet. There are no major setup/payoff gaps, but the “time after luck became measurable” premise is underused structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalies → theory → nexus alignment → override → lever → temporal disturbance and conceptual revelation. The scene holds as a single, coherent window with a clear before/after and a Conceptual Repricing closure (the xenos as timekeepers and her role in triggering a larger shift). Cost is mostly conceptual and prospective—alarms, AI concern, a hinted future of abandonment—so the on-page consequence feels relatively soft. Still, the structure is tight for the length and the ending legitimately reweights what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious program → research into Elias → return to the flooded opera house → water reconfigures the program → encounter in the in-between → performance that releases the symphony and Elias. The piece delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: before, the symphony is lost and the house dead; after, the music exists in Lena and the ghost is gone, with the opera house returned to dark stasis. Cost is moderate but present: she’s left alone in darkness with a singular responsibility. Structure (single continuous scene with light flashover into the in-between) is well-scaled for the length and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and causal: illustration → research → descent → unearthed box → note → internal shift, all under one coherent lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost, clearly marking a before/after in his relationship to prophecy and guilt. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single transition (station to valley and back) is smooth. The external mystery resolves perhaps a bit neatly, with the photograph/note functioning as a compact info payload rather than a dramatized confrontation, trimming some potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story’s causal chain is clean: exploration → sound → tunnel → faceless figure → offering the wheel → silence. Orientation is solid from the start, and the single-scene structure fits the length well. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias reinterprets the “ghost shift” and the hush after the clanking stops—but the stakes and price of that realization are understated, more conceptual than felt. The hinted backstory “truth” that led him here is gestured at but structurally underdeveloped, slightly weakening the sense of a fully earned end-state.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural design: life in the catacombs → discovery of the anomalous book → decision to give it to the river → return to stasis. Causality is coherent and the closure reads as Earned Stasis, with her refusal to claim the strange book as “not her story to keep.” However, the cost of that refusal is only lightly implied, so the before/after shift is conceptual rather than sharply felt. Structure is clean for the length but lands on a relatively gentle cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean and legible: setup of the eclipse and curl → creek encounter with Liora → communal eclipse scene as a coda. Causality in a magical-register way is coherent (curl draws him to creek; creek magic “answers”; girl appears), and the closure beat—reframing the curl as a beginning—lands. Still, the global drive is very low-pressure and essentially accumulative; the “mystery” resolves almost as soon as it is brought into focus, with little sense of cost or narrowing options. The eclipse gathering, while pretty, feels more like an epilogue flourish than a true escalated test of the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: silo → tapestry → diaries → axis slipping → dragons-as-door, with each element logically seeding the next. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the pattern of investigation is legible, leading to a conceptual repricing closure where the axis and dragons reconfigure meaning. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds, but cost at closure is relatively soft; we understand a threshold has been found, not yet crossed, so before/after is mostly conceptual rather than situationally drastic. A touch more dramatized consequence or resistance at the end could push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: logbook clue → lighthouse search → microdot revelation → arrival of the woman → request for specs → Elias’s decision to cooperate. The structure—present action braced by childhood backstory—is clear and efficiently handled for the length. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias chooses to “play” his father’s song, reconfiguring his role, though the concrete cost of this choice remains mostly implied. The timing of the woman’s arrival right after the discovery feels convenient but not structurally damaging.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each new sound layer, physical action, and line of thought builds toward a conceptual repricing of “possession” and “stillness.” Causality is intact—ritual → anchor’s tremble → anchor’s groan → internal reconfiguration—and the final shift (“The stillness wasn’t unraveled. / It was revealed.”) provides a legible before/after. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is clear by the midpoint and held through closure. Cost, however, is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see concrete consequences of this reconfiguration beyond a heightened awareness and spreading violet, which keeps the ending from landing with maximal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure (present at the spire interleaved with four memories) is clean and easy to follow. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: after moving through these memories and the shell’s silence, the horizon “shimmered, the mirror cracking just a little,” reweighting her relationship to the future. Causality is soft but coherent under this lens: each remembered “thing” builds pressure toward that final perceptual shift. Cost is more implied than explicit, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: accident on viaduct → clay tablet → labyrinth of timelines → confrontation with older self → refusal that collapses the construct. The story obeys its own rules at the level of metaphor, and the closure (choosing wholeness over the maze of alternatives) is legible with cost. The middle section in the generated labyrinth is a touch expository—stakes and rules are mostly stated rather than tested in concrete obstacles. Still, the structure holds under a causal lens with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with light, well-anchored backstory, accumulating toward the closing moment where Mira’s stance toward silence changes. Causality is modest but coherent—Elias’s discovery of the needle, his idea of “hush,” and the tactile demonstration with the drum build stepwise to her transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: numbness redefined as a medium she can work with. Stakes are internal and quiet but legible throughout, with no orientation or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: strange message → unease and sense of being watched → decision to investigate laterally via listening → realization that the quarantine hides something → commitment to act. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the piece maintains a single coherent scene with one temporal throughline. Closure lands as a Charged Poise moment when he turns toward the eastern quarter, but the concrete price of that choice remains mostly conceptual. The drive lens reads as largely Situational with light Causal scaffolding and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: vial discovery → greenhouse visit → encounter with the woman → reframed relationship to grief, all under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is clear enough—his avoidance and curiosity lead him here, the conversation is the hinge, and the ending reconfigures his stance toward the vial. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after regarding how he will live with grief. Stakes are modest but fully scaled to the length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the grotto → discovery and recontextualization of the rope → mounting sense of the choice → pulling it and experiencing the temporal fall. Causality holds, and the final beat offers a clear before/after in her understanding of time, satisfying closure. However, the cost of the choice is mostly theoretical; the world trembles but quickly re-stabilizes, softening the sense that a meaningful path has been foreclosed. The drive lens reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative, and that pattern is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival and tuning, playing, the answering hum, improvisational duet, then quiet reconfigured into anticipation. Causality is straightforward (she plays, the environment responds, she adjusts tactics with the bowl) and there is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end: the hush is now charged, not dead. The main weakness is that the “closure cost” is very soft; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond her continuing solitude, so the before/after is more tonal than stakes-driven. Still, the piece delivers a coherent single-scene arc without disorientation or structural noise.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions as a tight vignette with clear orientation and a coherent accumulative/textural drive: arrival, application of the petal, emotional effect, departure. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—“The transformation was complete, but for whom” and her step back into the dark—rather than a decisive external turn. Causality is clean, but stakes and consequences remain modest, so the felt “before/after” is more conceptual than sharply cutting. Effective and publishable-lean, but not structurally daring or deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: library → discovery of envelope → decision to deliver → encounter with Mara → fund idea. Structure is straightforward with a single temporal shift (library to inn) and no orientation issues. Closure is present in the commitment to initiate a fund, but the decisive change is modest and lightly priced. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a mild accumulative texture from recurring attention to invisible labor.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean and legible: arrival → meeting travelers → joint search → discovery of the tag → ritual at the arbor → reconfigured status. Causality holds under a mostly causal/accumulative lens; each step logically follows the last with no teleports or rule breaks. Closure is decisive and on-page: the sculpture is taken, the new line appears, and Liora’s social position changes. The plot is straightforward rather than intricate, but it’s appropriately scaled for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: search → rooftop canals → choice of path → chamber → hourglass → activation, with no serious orientation issues and a legible single-scene structure. Closure lands via a decisive act (turning the hourglass) that clearly alters reality, though the consequences and stakes of that change are only lightly implied. The drive lens reads primarily causal with some lyric accumulation, and that holds through the ending. What holds it below higher bands is the soft cost: the “world dissolved into light” is striking but doesn’t concretely reconfigure options or show the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from entry into the orchard, to ritual with the glass eyes, to a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens—each step (stepping stones, eyes placed, whispering, orchard’s response) escalates the emotional stakes and leads to the realization about ambiguous loss. Closure is solid: the before/after in his relationship to his sister’s absence is distinctly reweighted, with cost acknowledged. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the pressure curve is gentle, with no real risk of failure or disruption to his attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: outage → opportunity to move → cache action → near-discovery by Mara. Orientation (who/where/when) is precise early, and the story holds a single, coherent scene to a clear inflection point. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the beam of light, his hidden position, and the option to reveal himself crystallize into a before/after tension. The cost of either choice is implied rather than dramatized, so the structural turn feels more like a poised threshold than a fully realized change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single accumulating scene: odd plant behavior → investigation → contact → recognition → stance shift. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative/textural lens, with each observation deepening the uncanny rather than producing sharp reversals. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: by accepting the invitation and kneeling in the mud, Mara forecloses her old control-impulse with an implied cost of entering the unknown. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than sharply tested, but they are legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: dreams → brooch → rain trails → cave → guide → choice forms a coherent causal chain under a mostly Causal/Accumulative lens. The piece lands a valid Charged Poise/RR closure in the final image of him taking her hand as the tide erases paths behind them. Some elements (the brooch appearing in his pocket, the rules of memory-exchange) lean on uncanny implication rather than concrete stakes, softening the sense of irreversible cost. Still, nothing important breaks causality or orientation, and the narrative window is well-contained for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: cave → pilgrim’s arrival → identification of the pearl as “lens” → ritual → crack → disappearance and aftermath. The single scene progression plus one dream interlude is easy to follow and escalates logically from wonder to catastrophe. Closure is clear: the world is reweighted by Elias’s knowledge and the cave’s altered state, with a concrete loss (the pilgrim, the pearl’s integrity). The only limitation at this tier is that Elias’s lack of consequential choice in the climax keeps the structure from feeling fully driven by his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: meeting Dain → acquiring the second valve → accessing the tower → assembling the three valves → discovering the map and conceptual truth about erasure. The closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: the valves shift from relics to evidence of systemic erasure, reweighting the exile and their mission. Stakes and potential danger remain more implied than enacted, limiting the felt cost. Still, for this length, the structure is tight and the final turn is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: strange object → anomalous arrows → hidden courtyard → subterranean archive → conductor’s proposition → acceptance. Orientation (who/where/when) is briskly and effectively established, and the story holds a single continuous scene with no structural confusion. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/incipient Decisive Change when he takes her hand and commits to go, but the cost of that choice is only faintly implied. The piece reads more like an inciting chapter of a longer work than a fully self-contained arc with reconfigured stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival as skeptic → contact with tile → experience of others’ memories → reinterpretation of the tower’s purpose → decision to transcribe and stay. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative lens, with each beat deepening his understanding rather than introducing new external complications. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits the scene changed in stance and future intent, with his notebook as evidence. The cost is modest but present—he yields his protective skepticism and accepts the obligation to remember and return.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → weakened barriers → Kael’s intrusion → fight over amulet → activation → aftermath, with a legible before/after in Veyra’s stance. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure exists (Conceptual Repricing plus a small Decisive Change), but the cost of using the amulet is vague—Kael disappears and she’s burned, yet the dimensional or personal price remains conceptually soft. The storm’s sudden quiet reads a bit convenient rather than as the paid-off consequence of earlier setup.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: ink pot discovery → recognition of its power → intrusion by the woman → negotiation over its use → reconfigured alliance. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow, with no orientation problems. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: Elias reframes the pot from contraband to a tool for “proving the numbers wrong,” and the options for both characters are palpably altered. The only weakness is that the “by waiting actively” method, introduced at the decisive moment, is conceptually under-explained, so its stakes feel more gestural than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—observing the lamp’s hum, discovering the strange page, reframing his work, then writing the final line—builds cleanly toward a resonant reconfiguration where he accepts that the stories are “no longer just his own.” Causality is soft but coherent: curiosity about the unexplained page deepens his sense that time and stories refract through him, leading to the closing stance. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise as the hum stops and the distant train whistle echoes, marking a before/after in his relationship to solitude and time, though the cost is more conceptual than sharply felt. Orientation is clear throughout; no structural slips touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from the death certificate to the port maze, to his collecting habit, to the woman, to the reweighted ending, without causality breaks. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean very early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when he touches “Daniel Mercer” on the container and reframes what “finding” history means; the cost is quiet but legible. The middle does lean a bit static—strong on atmosphere, lighter on structural tightening beyond the woman’s appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival → shell vision → conceptual insight about the Compass → cello experiment → reinforced urgency → reweighted final stance. Causality holds at each step, and the time-echo shards are clearly anchored and return to the present. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias’s stance toward myth and the universe’s “hum” changes with a conceptual cost (he can’t go back to simple debunking). Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: discovery of the stone, decoding graffiti, realization of the threat to Vey, and Lan’s small-scale resistance building to the pre-vote night. Structure is essentially linear with an effective blend of summary and on-page present, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Lan’s stance crystallizes) rather than a decisive external change. The main weakness is that much of the conflict (privatization mechanics, concrete jeopardy to Vey) happens off-stage, so the climax feels more preparatory than confrontational. Still, under a hybrid causal/situational lens, the closure is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: arrive at crater → reflect and investigate → take the photograph → revalue the sand grain and leave. Causality is simple but coherent—his training gift, prior nights endured, and learned tricks with chemicals all feed into his stance in the present moment. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: he completes the task and accepts the crater’s erasure with the photograph and memory as the surviving proofs. Stakes remain small-scale and contemplative, but they are never confused.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: storm damage → months of repair → ticking clock of the maiden voyage → decision to launch → successful return that clarifies the feedback. Orientation is excellent and the structure holds as a single, continuous scene with one clear goal. However, the “last chance” premise never quite manifests as a felt narrowing of options or a meaningful cost at the end; success arrives smoothly. Closure reads as a modest resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change with strong consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clear and coherent: the falcon’s message → reflection on maps/phrasebook → present-tense observation of condensation → keeper’s counter-phrase → decision to go onto the ice. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure reads as Charged Poise, with the final decision framed as a before/after shift in options. Cost is implied (danger, the unknown lake) rather than dramatized on the page, which keeps the closure from feeling fully weighty. Orientation is strong from the outset; no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: days one through seven build a ritual process whose payoff is the final tuning and the town “listening.” Causality holds under a textural lens—each use of the fork and each patterned walk deepens resonance, culminating in cobblestones answering with light. Closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: before, the town is mute; after, it hums with a restored heartbeat and no longer needs a keeper. The main limitation is that the process unfolds with no real structural surprises or on-page complications once the pattern is established.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: distress signal → journey → entering the temple → learning the nature of the hush → using the vial to resolve the crisis. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the oxygen clock plus the temple’s nature create coherent pressure. Closure lands clearly with a decisive act that changes the situation and reconfigures Lira’s understanding, with a visible cost (sacrificing the vial and her last unspent piece of “home”). The main softness is how neatly the perfume solves the problem without much resistance or uncertainty once deployed.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous progression from entry to encounter in the lantern room, with each step (door, ledger, stairwell, hovering shape) logically escalating toward the confrontation. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: Elias’s pursuit of hush leads him to the ledger, names lead to his father, and that emotional spike drives him toward the final room. Closure lands via a decisive change (speaking his name, hush recoiling, lattice shattering, beam reigniting) with a clear before/after. The lingering open questions about the bodies and Elias’s ongoing chase read as purposeful Charged Poise rather than structural slack.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from arrival in the greenhouse to confrontation, revelation, and a quiet but decisive reconfiguration. Causality is simple but solid—the bride’s appearance and the bead’s activation trigger the memory that constitutes repayment of the debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she cannot undo the wound, but she now must live with fully reclaimed guilt. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal flash at the center, and that pattern is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → strange footprints → discovery of needle/voice → woven chamber/loom → memory-sewing → reconfigured relationship with the labyrinth. Causality holds in an accumulative/lyric way, with each object or image naturally leading to the next and culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page—Liora’s path shifts from seeking to being integrated, and the labyrinth’s exhale seals the change—but the concrete stakes and price of that integration remain somewhat abstract. There are no orientation or lens-clarity problems; the piece reads as a deliberate, textural build.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: return → entry into orchard → first shrine → accumulating artifacts → central chamber → activation of the sundial and apparition. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with the “Days bled into nights” compression working smoothly to bridge labor and discovery. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: placing the sundial alters the world-state and his understanding of faith. The main weakness is that no serious alternative path or failure mode ever threatens to derail the drive, softening the sense of structural risk.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive at arcade → work the puzzle → decode the meeting place → reunion and realization, all clearly causally linked. Backstory (grandfather, PO box, prior letter) is interwoven without derailing the present scene and all set-ups (numbers, chalk, margins) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration in the final encounter with his mother and the reframing of his lifelong work with names. The cost—years of estrangement and searching—is implied rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: noticing discrepancies → recognizing a pattern/date → linking it to coup rumors → choosing a method to spread the truth → a small network forms → the coup begins under new conditions. The structure is linear with one mild temporal jump, and orientation (where/who/when) is solid from the opening. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the world-state changes (coup begins) and Liora’s options and role are reweighted, even if we don’t see the confrontation itself. The main limitation is that some major developments (how exactly the others will “not let the coup go unchallenged”) are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens the sense of concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene arc: arrival in the charged setting → tests of the shard and environment → apparition confrontation → spoken admission and reframed stance. Causality is accumulative rather than plotty, but each move (“heals in moonlight” working, condensation messages, apparition) logically tightens the pressure toward finally voicing “I was afraid.” Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she does not send the letter, but the meaning of that inaction—and her relationship to apology—has decisively shifted. Cost is legible in her vulnerability and the refusal of tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene accumulating pressure from private rumination to shared, quasi-mystical connection, ending in a resonant reconfiguration of what the coral and casts mean. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each beat (“last evacuation” → return with coral → noticing boy → aligning casts) feels like a deepening rather than arbitrary. The ending provides closure via a conceptual repricing of fear into “Home,” with cost visible in their shared grief. The coordinates/Dr. Voss reveal is a small unkept setup, hinting at a wider plot the story never uses, which slightly undercuts structural tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—arrival and setup, exploration and shooting, development revelation, then return and reinstallation—reads as a coherent causal arc with a clear before/after in Liora’s stance. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the image itself changes (hand now holding the apple), reweighting past and present joy, and culminates in the public act of pinning it back. Drive is primarily accumulative but causality holds at each step; nothing important teleports or contradicts itself. Stakes stay small-scale and interior, but the arc is proportionate to the length and fully closed.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: restoration → strange sound → garden’s response → nickel’s influence → mural’s awakening → revelation of the door. The nested awakenings function as structural turns, each escalation clearly motivated by Elias’s interaction with the mural and nickel. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the mural redefined from artifact to threshold, and Elias’s options reconfigured by the “question” from the trumpet. The main limitation is that the initial “pause between question and reply” frame isn’t structurally paid off as an explicit clock or conversational beat, so the nominal temporal conceit feels looser than the physical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Quill arrives with a plan and relic, pitches the “warping,” the inspection spike tests their risk, and the map plus final garden-shard paragraph completes the arc. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the greenhouse/gardens become a covert communications network and the regime is already behind (“By the time the tax collectors noticed, it was too late”). The cost is more implied than dramatized—risk of punishment, memory of purges—so the ending feels satisfying but not searing. Structure (one core scene + brief future-tense shard) is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: shell → postcard → armistice → breeze/lullaby → writing → reweighted postcard and lullabies drifting outward. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from blocked grief to an active, if fragile, practice of transforming it, with the cost legible in his tears and ongoing insomnia. Causality is soft but coherent; each new image arises from a concrete prior stimulus. Escalation remains modest, but there is a clear before/after in his stance toward his sister’s absence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from setting and role to discovery of the song, to an understanding of the library’s function, to the bamboo tube and its partial activation. Causality is coherent (song → realization about names → glass orchids → recurring attempts with tube → final note and echo). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her life’s work is re-priced as “giving them a place to live again,” with the tube’s note triggering that insight. The cost is subtle—decades of solitary caretaking and regret rather than a sharp on-page loss—so the ending is moving but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene causal spine: study → experiment → awakening → invitation → committed choice, with the climax anchored in her speaking the final promise. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal actions in an accumulative, atmospheric build), and closure lands as a Charged Poise/Early Decisive Change: the archive is transformed, and her role shifts from deciphering to actively rewriting. Cost is implied (unknown price of binding herself to the symphonies and their ethics) but not concretely dramatized, which slightly mutes impact at this length. Structural focus is tight and legible, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrive with a plan, encounter the chain, follow it to the envelope, decode the message, and conceptually reprice her task. Causality is straightforward and legible, with the letter as the central hinge, and orientation (who/where/what she’s doing) is established early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she will adjust the floodgates “not to control the mountain, but to listen,” clearly distinguishing before/after. The cost—abandoning her fear that she’s erasing the past—reads, but remains more conceptual than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single scene in the attic with interleaved backstory, moving causally from investigation to new evidence to an explicit offer and decision. Orientation is excellent; place, time-window, and stakes are clear early. Closure lands as a quiet but legible decisive change—Elias chooses to stay and help rebuild the song trail, reconfiguring his trajectory. The cost of that choice (exposure, renewed grief) remains a bit implicit rather than dramatized, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece functions as a single, continuous, reflective scene with clean orientation and a coherent accumulative/textural drive. The closure—a conceptual reweighting of thresholds and “necessary distances” that leads Elias to leave the terrace—is legible and carries a felt cost. Causal plotting is light, but for this lyric mode the through-line from clue → reflection → revised understanding holds. The pilot code and butterfly-effect world are under-utilized structurally, feeling more like atmospheric set-up than active engines of change.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: feather discovery → luminous phenomena → activation as map → journey to chamber → closing choice as alarms sound. The structure fits a single continuous arc with a recognizable tightening toward sunrise and the sealing of the ruins. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: Elias chooses to leave despite finally “belonging,” and the cost is legible. The main limitation is that the ticking-clock threat and system “sealing” remain mostly told rather than dramatically constraining on-page options.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous progression from cave → tunnel → inner chamber, with the crater glass and the core question about disappearing paths providing through-line coherence. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the deepening darkness, color shifts in the glass, and discovery of the obsidian seed culminate in a clear conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands as an earned reconfiguration of her stance with a felt, if quiet, cost. Stakes remain interior and modest, but they are consistent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece has a clean single-scene structure: find token → choose to relinquish it → improvise → co-create a new act → realize she no longer needs the token. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she recognizes the performance itself as orchestrated serendipity without the bishop. Stakes and costs are modest, but the before/after in her relationship to chance/control is legible. No major orientation or lens-clarity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with a brief, well-anchored backstory shard, and cause-and-effect is clear: nostalgia ban → hidden relic → exile → meeting → dangerous collaboration. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings, and closure arrives through Liora’s decision to ally herself with the tattooist, reconfiguring her solitude and risk. Stakes are legible and the skinned poet anecdote effectively charges the choice, though there is only one major turn and it resolves without significant complication. Closure has a felt cost conceptually, even if on-page consequences remain implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: dream → bay → atrium → ritual → vision → realization, with one reflective block anchored to present stimuli. Causality is straightforward and the magical element arrives through a clear ritual (stone, pool, patterns). Closure lands as an internal reconfiguration of how Elias understands light and his work, though the “reckoning” and its cost remain abstract. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: find the box → encounter its owner → co-create the written account, with no orientation issues. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, as each beat intensifies the emotional premise rather than driving a sharp plot turn. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—“rewriting the bargain”—with a legible emotional cost and before/after shift. The main limitation is that the stakes never quite feel tested; events unfold smoothly without a moment where either character seriously might refuse or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: grotto → discovery of the gauge → dream of trial balloons → intensified pattern-making → gauge activation and realization. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural/accumulative lens, culminating in a conceptual shift about the gauge and hope. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her world is reweighted by the knowledge that the gauge is a bridge—but the cost is only lightly implied (ongoing obsession, solitary labor) rather than dramatized. The scene holds together, yet the transformation comes easily, without a concrete on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: diaries → passage → film strip → deeper corridor → door → woman → map and revelation. The scene sustains a single throughline with a clear build, and the ending lands as a charged poise/early conceptual repricing (Elias realizes the walls’ agency and cost of legacy as he reaches toward the living map). The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible: he is stepping into a burden that consumed his father. Structure is tight for the length, with no major orientation or lens issues.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a brief, well-anchored dip into backstory that clearly tilts the present. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through the changing state of the mirage and the tolling bells, culminating in a closure beat where perception and belief realign. Causality is soft but coherent—each step (lullabies → terrace ritual → bells → intensified mirage → belief) follows plausibly. The main limitation is that the closure’s cost and consequence remain conceptual rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous negotiation scene with a clear progression from wary arrival to symbolic exchange (the coin) to a joint commitment. Causality is coherent—Liora’s decision to come, Kessar’s question about her future, and the coin all drive toward her final stance. Closure lands as a quiet but legible Decisive Change / Charged Poise: she chooses partnership in carrying the burden instead of solitary endurance or retreat. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and relational, but they track clearly under a situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: he created the drought, followed a map, reached the center, and chose to end what he began; closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost. Structure is linear and coherent, with reflection anchored to present stimuli (salt flat, egg, thunder) rather than free-floating. However, the practical release—“a few taps on his phone”—feels frictionless, muting the sense of risk or logistical resistance at the climax. Overall, the drive lens is primarily causal with a strong conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: arrival in the courtyard → engagement with the knot → memory-triggered untangling → entry into the sanctuary → harvesting echoes → reconfigured understanding and exit. The drive lens reads as Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, with the ritual of untangling and listening building toward the conceptual turn about conformity as silence. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora leaves changed in stance, with the sanctuary dimmed and her steps lighter, marking a before/after. The main limitation is that the cost of this change remains more implied than dramatized, keeping the structural arc solid but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense ritual in the dome, interleaved with specific anecdotes (the fisherman story, the brother’s critique) that all feed a single throughline. Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: details and reflections build toward a charged poise ending rather than a decisive causal turn. Closure lands via a quiet reconfiguration—finishing the story, darkness, then soft light and renewed commitment—but the cost of that choice is only lightly implied. Causality within the scene is intact, though the stakes remain more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: signals are built, monarchs arrive, a message is written, and then the butterflies and Liora both move on, giving a clear before/after. The Oaxaca memory is brief, concretely anchored, and sharpens the logic of the present rather than stalling it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: she accepts that honoring is not contingent on recurrence, and that the grotto will forget her. Stakes and causality are quiet but coherent; no key setup is left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual sequence in the sanctum, anchored by the rope and organ card, leading to a clear closure beat where his future course crystallizes. The causal spine (guilt → discovery of the card → months of work → present ceremony → new vow) is coherent and easy to follow under an accumulative, lyric lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he redefines his life from a maker of objects to a keeper of names, and the “weight in his chest” easing is an on-page cost/shift. The piece remains low on overt turning points or complications, so escalation relies almost entirely on tonal and imagistic deepening rather than structurally tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: bunker → seal/directive → dream → forest path → woman/tree → key, with the storm as a time-pressure backdrop. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one transition and a clear progression from contemplation to encounter to reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the directive rather than a decisive external change, but it’s legible and on-page. The main limitation is that the plot pressure never tightens to a point where options or costs feel sharply constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story is tightly structured as a single causal sequence: theft → palace intrusion → ritual → apparition → redefinition of the covenant → mercenaries’ arrival. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the first paragraph, and the “between regimes” frame is cleanly carried into the climax. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he realizes the tile preserves knowledge/future rather than binding gods, and the on-page cost is losing the artifact’s power in exchange for a fragile vision and a shard. The only thing holding this below the very top band is that the mercenary threat, though present, never fully tangles with the central mystical encounter in a way that forces a sharper tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: broken box → sanctuary’s restorative magic → Veyra’s appearance → cellular-memory confrontation → partial release of resentment. The piece follows a single continuous scene with one coherent drive—whether Elara will seek vengeance or enact her teaching—ending in a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn. Closure lands on the page via the felt shift in both characters and the music box’s restoration, with emotional cost legible in Elara’s relinquished revenge. Stakes could tighten further—there’s little sense that refusal or failure would materially change their options beyond inner torment—keeping this just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the sextant’s humming leads to the fog’s path, to the glass mountain, to the climb, to holding the dream, and finally to the sextant’s restoration and the orchard’s revelation. The piece reads as a mostly continuous scene with one tight backstory insertion, and the orientation (who/where/what-now) is clear early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world slightly mends and the protagonist’s relationship to dreams changes, but the cost is more implied than viscerally felt. The lack of a harder price or more constrained options keeps this from pushing higher.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: arrival → encounter with the girl → repair of the pendant → quiet reconfiguration at the end, under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is intact and legible—each move grows naturally from the prior one—but the central “drive” stays gentle and internal, more mood than compulsion. Closure does occur in the conceptual repricing of safety, promises, and memory (“it’s not the remembering that matters—it’s what you do with it”), but the cost is implied rather than strongly dramatized. The “breach of contract” and old/new world tension remain more atmospheric than structurally live, limiting the sense of before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: gallery → bathroom realization → return to gallery, with each move clearly motivated. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she re-understands the shell, the orchard, and her role, with a before/after legible in her new commitment to “pursue” rather than solve. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—reflection deepens pressure rather than stalling it. The main limitation is that cost remains mostly intellectual; nothing in the world pushes back or visibly raises the price of this new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: disturbance → pursuit of the traveler → joint quest for the library → door → sister in the core. The piece maintains a single continuous throughline with no orientation issues and a clear closure unit (resonant reconfiguration via the reunion and realization). However, the risk set up (“we might not come out the same”) never concretely complicates the final outcome, so cost at closure feels soft. Some set-ups like the missing key and the backward watch don’t fully pay off structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → clue-hunt through the ship → discovery of the garden → encounter with Liora → fog-charged ending. Causality is straightforward and coherent, with each location giving him a new piece of her trail. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: his stated aim to “recapture” is quietly replaced by “understand,” and the final swallowing fog marks a before/after. The cost (losing the possibility of conventional reunion) is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which holds the piece out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: impossible door → hidden room/objects → rope reconfiguration → vision of erasure → decision to archive. The single temporal shift to the past is clearly cued and returns coherently to the present, and the closure unit (Liora’s decision and the vanishing door) reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a conceptual cost. The structure fits the length well, but the cost of her decision remains mostly implied rather than dramatized, so the before/after line is more intellectual than pressured. Still, the piece has a satisfying arc with no major causal or orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured around a causal quest: Ryn tracks the path, discovers the bloom, attempts to bind it, then flees with altered stakes. Setups (stone, beings, labyrinthine caves) pay off directly in the climax, and the closure—saving the silence in reduced form at the cost of the bloom—is on the page and legible. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture from the worldbuilding, and that lens holds. It stops short of exceptional because complications (the beings sensing her, the binding working) arrive and resolve somewhat smoothly, without a more surprising or knotted turn.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-time frame at the pavilion, interleaved with concise backstory, culminating in the discovery of the distant beacon and his decision to go. Causality is intact—prism found → experimented with → altered pavilion song → glimpse of beacon → decision—and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a decisive change (he abandons his post to seek the beacon) with a clear before/after. The cost and consequences of that choice are more implied than dramatized, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure: arrival, three monuments as progressive beats, revelation, and decision. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/textural lens: examining shadows → noticing anomalies → conjecture about the fog → chorus of echoes → revaluation of the observatory and fog bridge. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing when she reframes the bridge as something to be walked backward, with her implied choice marking a before/after. The cost of that choice could be sharpened slightly, but the structural arc is cohesive and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: note → journey → fortress interior → ignition → revelation of the figures → reinterpreted purpose, all in one coherent scene with a small, efficient backstory inset. Causality holds and the accumulative/textural drive is consistent, with each step deepening the charged atmosphere rather than jumping tracks. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices her mission from “defy hopelessness” to “remember it,” with the glowing fortress and warm stone under her palm anchoring that shift. The main limitation is that the cost of this repricing is more conceptual than dramatically tested, which keeps it just shy of elite-tier closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: escape from conversation → reflection and backstory → experiment with cicada → supernatural event → realization and return. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reinterprets the cicada as a key not to the grotto but to the charged pause with her brother, and her stance changes. The cost of what she’s going back to (the possibility of leaving the village) is only lightly sketched, which slightly softens the ending’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene structure with a clear before/after: Liora moves from rumor-bound sky to embodied experience, ending in a charged poise that promises return. Causality is simple but intact: the inversion enables the trellis, which enables her transgressive ascent, which leads to the encounter and to a reconfigured stance toward her confinement. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she will go back to the bunker, but now with a live alternative in mind—though the cost remains mostly conceptual and implied rather than viscerally dramatized. Escalation is gentle, more accumulative than sharply turning, but the gravity re-righting and enforced “Next time” give the scene a satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, single POV, with a clear pattern of approach → tension (her trying to “catalyze” silence, storm glass darkening) → guided listening → reconfigured quiet. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (silence becoming comforting, storm glass stilling) is on-page and legible. Causality is understated but coherent—Elias’s choice to stop the gondola and invite listening is the hinge. The felt cost is subtle (surrendering control over grief, accepting unfilled silence), which keeps this solid but not towering.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: waterfall → orchard → flake → staircase → murals → throne → ascension, with each discovery logically enabling the next. Structure is simple but solid, essentially one continuous descent and claiming scene, with a clear closure beat (she sits; time limit to decide her course). The Old Architects’ “trickster” reputation sets up potential complication, but the test proves relatively straightforward, limiting surprise and complexity. Cost remains mostly conceptual at the end, though the story does land a coherent Charged Poise closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: withdrawal → encroaching dreams/knocks → child’s arrival → touch that reopens her calling. The single-scene structure with embedded backstory respects scope and lands a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The threshold-as-choice is legible and satisfying. The only limitation is that the years-long siege by the world is mostly summarized, so escalation from total refusal to sudden acceptance feels a touch compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: bolt → messages → coordinates → porthole → multiverse offer → refusal → new commitment, with no major gaps. Closure lands as an on-page decisive choice (turning the bolt counterclockwise, rejecting the swap) with conceptual cost clearly implied. The story stays in one through-line with a brief, functional backstory insertion about the pyramid scheme that directly charges the present action. The only limitation is that the mechanics of the “quantum promise” remain a bit high-level, so the stakes of switching lives could be sharpened further.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is clean: desire → fixation on the manuscript/handle → crossing the bridge → turning the crank → standing waves → revelation of erasure and the Council. The piece delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end (his family was erased, not fallen), which gives closure. However, the decisive moment is mostly informational—options and tactics for Elias going forward remain abstract, so the cost and narrowing of paths feel muted. Structure is otherwise tight and legible within a single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single escalating scene: discovery of the program → apparition of the woman → revelation of the marionette reality → Aldric’s decisive surrender. Causality is coherent and the closure is a clear Decisive Change with cost (abandoning the sword/self-concept to become part of the puppetry). The drive reads as Hybrid (situational/cosmic pressure plus a single key choice), held consistently. The only limitation is that the global “world unsnapping” stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than being grounded in a concrete dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: button discovery → decision to investigate → landlady conversation → postcard revelation → reframed relationship to his work. The piece fits a compact investigative structure and lands a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Stakes stay small but consistent, and there are no orientation or plausibility issues. The ending clearly closes the drive: having sought one human answer, Elias can now carry his archival burden differently.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: key → lagoon/puddle-map → hatch → tunnel → server room → upload → enforcers → ENTER → broadcast, with no orientation issues and a solid, earned closure beat. The drive lens is primarily causal, and the final decisive change (Lira chooses to broadcast under imminent capture) lands with a clear implied cost. The only slight weakness is that the enforcers’ arrival feels engineered to coincide with the upload climax, rather than emerging from earlier concrete surveillance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: morning approach → grotto performance → dissolution of the prophecy’s immediate threat → quiet exit, all under a single POV. Causality is coherent (he deciphers the melody, goes to the grotto, plays it back, and the city is spared for now), and the closure—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise where the task is temporarily complete but cyclical—is legible. The drive lens reads as mainly accumulative/textural: pressure builds through atmosphere, ritual, and music rather than reversals. Stakes remain a bit abstracted (the city’s “drown[ing] in its own noise” never gets a concrete near-miss), softening the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: initial pattern-seeking → moonstone speck → dream-root descent → dust revelation → villagers’ morning perspective. Causality is legible under a textural lens, especially the crumbling monument releasing dust that unlocks the leaf-language. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the leaves become language of the forgotten, and Liora becomes part of the folklore. The main limitation is relatively modest on-page cost; the transformation is enchanting but almost frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: broken clock/compass in workshop → compass leading him to greenhouse/trapdoor → subterranean waterfall gateway → clockwork city and reactivated clock. The structure (a sequence of linked locations) is easy to follow, with a clear closure unit when the clock starts and the city stutters. Still, stakes and cost are underdeveloped: we’re told this world is strange and frozen, but the danger or sacrifice of stepping through the waterfall and altering the city remains largely conceptual. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light conceptual repricing at the end, which holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: search-party departure → solitary investigation → discovery of coin/name → tunnel pursuit → confrontation and quiet reconfiguration. Causality holds under a largely internal, causal drive lens, and the closure (her reframed sense of redemption and rejoining Elias) is legible with some emotional cost. However, the path is a bit frictionless—she finds the coin and then Elias with minimal obstacle—so escalation feels more like a sequence of stations than tightening pressure. The “factually mystical” coin never needs to operate as more than a symbol, which slightly dulls the stakes and the sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: approach to Echo Gorge → encounter with ghost woman → exchange of laughter-note → departure into sunrise, with a clear before/after in his relation to his role and to laughter. Causality is simple but intact, and the choice to come for laughter rather than souls frames the piece effectively under an accumulative, lyric lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from seeing himself as failed collector to someone who can hold a living fragment of laughter. The cost—years of failure and solitude—remains mostly implicit rather than sharply dramatized at the end, keeping this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias goes to the forest to seek answers, meets the masked stranger, drinks the vial, and receives a revealing vision—one continuous scene under a stable lens. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: mercy becomes a shifting variable and a practical “knowing when to stop,” reweighting his past interrogations and his future choices. The stranger’s arrival with exactly what he needs feels convenient and under-motivated, softening pressure even though it doesn’t break logic. Still, the progression from seeking → test (drink) → reconfiguration lands coherently with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: market → fragment → painting → night of writing/revelation → return to market and charged ending image. The accumulative/textural drive holds: each beat intensifies her relationship to the fragment and the drowned lighthouse stories. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where her work shifts from “translation” to “retrieval,” with an ongoing quest implied as cost. Stakes are modest and mostly conceptual, but the ending is structurally and emotionally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: the stalled elevator call leads her into the ticket office, observations of wrongness build to the revelation of the crack, and the mainspring closes it, followed by a quiet denouement. Causality is intact and easy to trace, and the closure (crack sealed, ghosts sleep, she recommits to watching ceilings) gives a clear before/after. The cost is present but modest (the burning metal, the implied ongoing burden of vigilance). Overall, the piece delivers a satisfying, coherent arc, though the stakes remain mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: the bottled whisper triggers rupture, the frost-map reveals stakes, the page in the time chamber accelerates collapse, and the new world closes the arc. Orientation is strong from the opening image, and the accumulative/causal lens holds throughout. Closure delivers a decisive change with cost—the loss of the library and a reconfigured reality. The only limitation is that the stakes, while global, remain somewhat abstract rather than grounded in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: present-tense situation, brief backstory, confrontation with Liora, and then a climactic ritual that produces a clear reconfiguration (the civilization’s “voice” returning at real personal cost). Causality is largely intact—storm peaks → he uses shard and mirrors → story unfolds—under a mostly causal lens. However, the mechanics and concrete consequences of “giving them back their voice” are abstract: we don’t fully grasp what changes for the world or Core scholars beyond a conceptual victory and his physical weakening. Closure is nonetheless on-page and legible as a meaningful, if quiet, turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: chip discovery → chamber’s response → stranger’s arrival and exposition → memory shock → decision to install the chip → world/light shift. Closure lands as a decisive change in both Elias and the world, with on-page cost via painful memory and self-confrontation. The structure is linear and contained, appropriate for the length, but the world-scale “balance” and restoration feel a bit convenient given how quickly they resolve after one act. The stranger’s knowledge and timing are accepted rather than challenged, keeping the plot just shy of fully textured.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: factory closure → years of collecting → discovery of compass → decision to delve → lagoon encounter → repriced understanding and vial act. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens, and the ending offers a clear Conceptual Repricing (petrichor as the world waking, the factory’s shutdown reframed). The closure image is legible and satisfying, but the decisive shift is mostly conceptual, with only a light sense of consequence for Elias’s future options. A slightly sharper articulation of what is now at stake for him or the valley would strengthen the closure further.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: GPS failure → archway → lantern slide shattering → Mara’s appearance → descent to the cavern → Elias carving the bridge. The piece achieves a coherent closure unit via a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias joins the timekeeping alliance and the storm’s quieting mirrors that shift. However, the cost of this change (“He didn’t know how long he’d stay, or if he’d ever leave”) is only glancingly treated, softening the impact of the before/after divide. Structure is otherwise tight, with no orientation issues or gratuitous detours.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: pavilion → cathedral → pavilion, with each leg linked by Liora’s goal and the recurring flowers. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the buildup of motifs (postcards, stained glass, snowmelt, night flowers) leads to a clear conceptual repricing of darkness and endings. Causality is soft but coherent—her study of the glass and postcards informs the epiphany, which then changes how she finishes the mural. The cost is subtle (she relinquishes the need for external answers/validation), which works for a quiet piece but keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: storm → letters/diary → retrocognitive vision → defiance of warning → lagoon descent → confrontation/escape, with a solid sense of before/after at the end. The closure unit—a decisive escape with the ledgers while Miriam remains trapped and the lagoon consumes the pursuers—is legible and carries cost. Some turns feel conveniently timed (Lila’s sudden appearance after the “Parley” message; the trucks arriving just as they retrieve the ledgers), and the lagoon’s intervention to dispose of the men skirts deus-ex-machina, though it’s at least prefigured. Still, the structure holds under a causal/situational hybrid lens and feels complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: single POV, one primary scene with a brief history interlude, and a clear progression from finding the bottle to attempting a mental “opening” to a subtle town-wide shift. The causal chain is legible under a fantasy logic: sustained working-memory focus on the bottle’s essence awakens the latent last wish and sparks revival. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the town’s ruin and the wishwell are re-understood as potential rather than loss. The main weakness is that the decisive change feels almost frictionless—no clear risk or alternative path to sharpen the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with one memory shard that’s well-anchored and feeds back into the present. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: language experiments → prophetic awareness → omen (pomegranate) → dead-chorus playback → conceptual repricing of the foghorn’s silence. Closure is solid as a conceptual reweighting of the premise, with the final decision to “get started” feeling like a meaningful reorientation rather than a mere observation. Stakes remain mostly intellectual/experiential rather than pressured, which keeps the structure strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds as a single continuous scene with a clean causal spine: long guarding → hatching → experiment with vortex → partial reopening → conceptual reconfiguration. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she understands what borrowed time is and reorients her purpose around it. Stakes and rules are legible enough for this lyric mode, and there are no orientation slips. The main structural limitation is that the experiment’s “cost” (beyond exhaustion and fleeting loss) remains relatively soft and mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: long build-up of the storm → priests’ new siren → her secret rewiring → her choice to wait → storm’s sudden escalation → forced reversal and bell pull. The piece adheres to a clear Causal/Situational lens with one major turn when the storm "changes its mind," which reconfigures the meaning of her prior choice. Closure lands via an on-page Decisive Change (she pulls the rope, accepting being wrong) plus an Earned Stasis/RR (she recommits to listening with new gravity). The only limitation is that the cost to the village and her position remains largely conceptual rather than concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is simple but solid: an abandoned station, a long vigil, a rare event, and a quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is clean—the alarms, the screen’s flicker, and the lantern’s activation all follow logically from the setup and Elias’s long tenure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: his role and the station’s meaning change in a legible before/after way without violating the accumulative, lyric lens. The cost is subtle (a life framed as custodial suddenly reweighted) but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene with a clear causal chain—ghosts gather at the box → beekeeper ghost appears and points → Elias opens the box → message reconfigures meaning and releases the ghosts. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost; the ghost rules are consistent enough for the length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his covenant is quietly broken, ghosts disperse, and silence is reweighted. The main limitation is that the pivotal act (opening the box) feels relatively low-friction compared to the seventeen-year setup.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: discovery of the fragment, investigation via garage sales, the key interaction, the dream revelation, and the return to the silo form a coherent arc. Causality under a largely accumulative/textural lens holds: each step meaningfully reframes the urn and Elias’s role, leading to a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure is present and satisfying—Elias shifts from seeker to active timekeeper and accepts a charged, ongoing task. The main limitation is that obstacles are soft and the path from urn fragment to grand realization feels almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: feather → water entry → snapped kite string → woven dawns → writing, culminating in a clear before/after stance on grief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief persists but is recontextualized as something that can “harmonize into hope,” and this is manifested through the act of writing. Causality is soft but coherent; each new image grows logically from the last, and there are no orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean single scene with a steady accumulative drive: caretaker prepares the orchard as a trap/witness before developers arrive. Causality is coherent—diagnosis → urgency → plan to remodel → first tangible result by dusk—but there’s no strong on-page turn in tactics or options. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: we end on the enduring memory of trees/stone vs. his mortality, with cost implied. The off-stage developers and lack of concrete interference keep the story from feeling structurally taut at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: approach → recollected first contact → entry into tower → ritual with amber → realization, all linked by clear because/therefore causality. The closure unit is a conceptual reconfiguration (homecoming as chemistry, belief reframed) that lands on the page, though the cost is mostly intellectual/spiritual rather than starkly dramatized. There are no orientation issues or rule breaks, but escalation is modest and the final turn is more explained than enacted. Strongly functional, not yet structurally remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative lyric: he arrives, we accumulate history (reef, battlefield, dead languages), then he scatters seeds and leaves, with closure in the reweighted image of the jetty and battlefield’s future memory. Causality is soft but coherent: his knowledge of the dead and the heron’s “invitation” lead to the fertilizing act. The closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis, with a clear before/after stance: he has acted once, and the rest is ceded to the earth. The relative lack of escalation or tightened options prevents this from reaching the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: scrapyard exile → riddle → search for source → phonograph revelation → commitment to enter The Hollows. The story lands a clear Decisive Change at the end, with Elias choosing to re-enter the war’s underworld; the cost is legible in the context of his trauma and attempted withdrawal. Structure is tight for the length, with reflection anchored to present stimuli (the leaf, the cylinder) so it doesn’t blur orientation. A slightly more pressured middle beat—any complication between message and decision—could have deepened the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a quiet status quo, a single disturbance (the flicker/anomaly), the compass’s reaction, and a culminating decision to engage through drawing. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure (re-seeing the station as threshold) lands on the page with a legible before/after. The stakes remain conceptual rather than situationally tight—no clear danger or irreversible step is articulated—so the cost of the closure is more implied than felt. Still, for this length and mode, the arc reads complete and well-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: climb → encounter guardian → secret-trade → receive lid → altered understanding of time/unknown. Structure holds as a single, coherent scene with no orientation issues, and the guardian’s rules are legible. The “miscalculation” beat is undercut because nothing truly goes wrong; she still receives the lid without paying an evident price. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing around time and the unknown rather than a decisive plot turn, which works but keeps stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens: walking, echoes, and absences build toward a conceptual shift rather than a plot twist. Causality is modest but present—Liora’s arrival with a goal, the man’s challenge about how history is written, and her choice to leave the chessboard and walk differently. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: she renounces pawnhood and claims the role of historian, with the interregnum itself reweighted as a space of possibility. Stakes and cost are quiet but legible: she abandons old scripts and the comfort of being directed, accepting the burden of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear and efficient: dreams → feather → journal/map → descent → stone → reconfiguration of the mountain and Elias’s idea of home. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a lyric overlay, and closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “home” and “buried talents.” The cost is somewhat soft (the feather dissolves; no hard on-page sacrifice), but there is a legible before/after in both world and understanding. Structure is coherent and well-contained for the length, with no major orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias’s obsession → decoding the tapestry → unveiling the mirror → entering the masquerade memory → confrontation with Liora → reknitted tapestry and altered inner stance. The two-shard structure (village frame and masquerade memory) is legible, with the labyrinth and tapestry linking them. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot change events, only his relationship to them, and this is made concrete by the cool labyrinth and his stillness. No major orientation or causality slips; scope is exactly right for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative arc: arrival at the Bone Towers, encounter with Echo, escalating poetic invocations that wake the spire, and a final reframing of what forgiveness costs. Causality is coherent—each poem visibly changes the environment and deepens Lira’s understanding—while the canyon and towers provide a unifying frame. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Lira shifts from appeasing elders to claiming the courage to speak, with a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the off-page ritual’s stakes remain abstract, so the structural turn doesn’t quite bite as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with a causal chain: observation of pockmarks → recognition of mapping → use of the charm → transformation. Closure lands as a decisive change plus reconfiguration: memories cohere and the workshop stabilizes, with the acid sea calming. Stakes and cost are mostly internal and conceptual, but the groaning workshop and acid sea give enough external frame to keep the drive intelligible. The solution arrives somewhat smoothly once the “map” insight appears, with little resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: return to caves → wrong passage → hidden pool and shell → dive and ledge → tunnel of older paintings → blank canvas and “Remember” → new painting and reframed purpose. The piece operates under a largely accumulative/textural lens, but causality is still solid and closure is a clear conceptual repricing with a felt cost. The cave as threshold and the blank canvas as final object create a distinct before/after. The stakes stay modestly scaled yet coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: lighthouse present, brief backstory, then the experiment with the cork and storm culminating in the echoing note and Elias’s reframed belief. Causality is coherent at the lyric level—cork discovery → hypothesis → deliberate test in heightened weather → perceptual confirmation—and the storm functions as a natural, escalating frame. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s responsiveness, once a private theory, now feels mutually acknowledged by Elias and (partially) Maren. The cost is subtle but real—he sacrifices the found object and risks being exposed as a fool in real time—but stakes never sharpen beyond that conceptual layer.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: one primary scene at the station with integrated backstory, oriented early, and a clear throughline from arrival to departure. Causality is modest but intact: sister’s call → pattern of calls → censer as bridge/map → new midnight call → decision to leave. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—he commits to the “place where the water used to be”—but the stakes and cost are muted, more atmospheric than pressured. There are no major plot gaps, yet escalation is slight and the sense of before/after is more tonal than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the eye → researching it → testing it → experiencing its distortions → nightmares → burial and conceptual shift. The structure is tight for the length, with one dominant drive (will the eye give her safety from truth or not?) culminating in a decisive renunciation that clearly reconfigures her stance. Closure is strong: burying the eye and accepting fear as remaining is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. No major orientation or lens ambiguity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: stranger arrives/dies → Elias chooses a mode of investigation → borrowed memories surface → he reinterprets the death and accepts custodianship. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure (reframing the stranger’s purpose and Elias’s role) lands on the page. The cost is conceptual—his solitude is now burdened with another life’s residue—though that price is only lightly dramatized. Orientation is excellent from the opening, with no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: rising creek and ants → hidden passage → cavern and door → chip as key → activation of path. Structure is linear and efficient, with backstory seeded early and paying off in the father-chip connection at the door. Closure lands as a decisive change—he engages the mechanism that opens a new path, implicitly abandoning his old stasis—with cost legible in the relinquished promise. The piece could be even stronger with one more beat of on-page resistance before he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: dreams → warning raven → decision to climb → grotto → mirror encounter → transformed return. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear before/after at the ending (marked skin vs. humming bones, disenchanted queen vs. reborn one). The main weakness is that the “final warning” and “the grotto hungers” never fully cash out into concrete consequences, so the cost of failure remains abstract. Closure does land as a decisive change, but the stakes feel more mythic than pressingly urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: we move from contemplation at the nexus, to Elias’s return, to the revelation of his work, to the shared experiment on the curl, ending in a reconfigured stance toward presence. Causality holds—Elias’s disappearance and note motivate the meeting; the curl and vial lead directly to the final act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: presence shifts from something to capture to something to share with cost implied in Elias’s altered state. Stakes and consequences remain somewhat abstract, so the emotional price of the final choice never fully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is clean: the present frame in the cabin anchors early, backstory (the grave, Harkin) is well-motivated by the scroll, and causality under an accumulative lens holds. The scroll discovery → grave memory → mounting jealousy and fear → presence at the door gives a clear tightening line. Closure is a Charged Poise: the door opening externalizes the temporal/identity threat that has been internal, but there’s no explicit decisive change or conceptual repricing that reweights the whole premise, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: Clara arrives with an object and an apparent request, Elias intuits the deeper need, elicits backstory, then transforms the object in response. Causality is intact and accumulative: his history with absence primes him to understand her, and her story plus the shared name reweights his sense of self. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration; the “before” (defined by loss) versus “after” (holding meaning) is legible with emotional cost. The coincidence of the name is thematically charged rather than cheap, though it edges toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival in the lull, attempt and failure pattern (crystallization), a surprising new rune, and an internal reconfiguration at the return of rain. Causality is clear—her deliberate choice to let the ink crystallize produces the new rune and realization. Closure is solidly an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in the accepted, irrevocable losses. The structure is strong but not formally daring, with relatively gentle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Elias returns because of the orchard’s impending destruction and his unresolved guilt, discovers the bottle, chooses to attempt contact with his tools, and the ritual yields a partial, costly success that reconfigures his understanding. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the archive, the bottle, the music) and never derails the current scene. Closure lands clearly as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he has spoken the apology, received a small, uncanny response, and walks out as the trees fall, with a before/after legible in his lighter yet still burdened departure. The only slight limitation is that external stakes remain modest, keeping the arc intimate rather than structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is quick and clean: we know where we are, who Elara is, and what’s wrong with the universe. The causal chain is simple but coherent—fading words and a broken stone → decision to unify words/illusions → offering the dictionary to the stone → entry into the void → weaving a new order. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing, with the universe’s hiccup resolved and Elara’s role redefined. The main structural weakness is how effortlessly the stone reactivates and the void yields to her weaving, which softens the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: malfunctioning clocks → horizon distortion → failed mechanical fix → blood-triggered restart and conceptual reinterpretation. Causality is legible even within the slightly uncanny frame (his blood as a catalyst) and there’s a clear before/after boundary when the horizon snaps back and the clocks chime. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: what clocks measure is redefined on the page with a tangible cost (blood, risk of harm). The only ceiling is that stakes remain largely conceptual and atmospheric rather than concretely life-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single, continuous scene with a clear beginning (Elias’s experiment), middle (Mara’s reveal and the vial), and end (the synchronized pulse). Causality is coherent: the prior “familiar stranger” encounters pay off when Mara admits planting spores, and Elias’s final act with the laser leads directly to the spore/farm flare. However, the drive is mostly conceptual/accumulative; stakes and options don’t narrow much, and the “now we let go” turn is more a tonal pivot than a concrete, pressured decision. Closure functions as a charged poise/incipient alliance rather than a decisive change with palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from subway scrawls → library → archive book → lantern → revelation is clean and legible, and the scene honors a single throughline. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s understanding of “the house always wins” is overturned, and her options for paying the debt reconfigure. The heart attack, debts, and prior traversal are efficiently compressed into backstory that clearly motivates the present scene. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than situationally sharp, but it is present and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is accumulative: a present-tense frame of the tunnel and booth, then patterned shards of callers that build toward a quiet reconfiguration when the woman says “I think I’m ready” and the boy stops calling. Causality is soft but coherent—Mara’s long-term stance leads to these outcomes, even if offstage. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s role is reweighted by the callers’ changes and her doubt about “enough.” The main limitation is the relatively flat trajectory of on-page events; the piece relies heavily on summary of repeated calls rather than a single, escalated present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single scene accumulating toward the decision to cast away the locket, with backstory anchored to concrete present cues. Causality is simple but intact—his years of failed preservation efforts lead to the realization that release is the only remaining option. Closure qualifies as an Earned Stasis/RR: he forecloses the path of object-based remembrance at visible emotional cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural throughout and holds at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: rumors → arrival at the station → on-page encounter → reconfiguration of stakes, all under a clear causal/situational lens. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing when the reciprocity “debt” model reframes Elias’s quest and the moon rock trade, with visible cost (he loses his talisman and hoped-for cure). Backstory about the rumors and earlier sightings is efficiently integrated and tilts the present rather than stalling it. It’s tight and publishable, though the encounter resolves a bit quickly once the logistician appears.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single accumulative journey into the forest, guided by music and compass, toward a promised stillpoint, culminating in a clear before/after. Causality is simple but consistent—notes and compass lead her deeper until the clearing, where the encounter with the tree reconfigures her understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ring points inward, she internalizes the stillpoint’s song, and returns changed with a new “map” inside her. The piece doesn’t aim for complex plotting, but within its lyric mode, the arc is well-shaped and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one anchored scene in the plaza framed by concise backstory about the misinterpreted signal and the town’s warped memory. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/situational lens, with the dream and conversation nudging Liora toward a new stance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—reframing history as editable—with some sense of before/after. The cost and concrete implications of this decision remain abstract, so the final turn doesn’t fully tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: harbor → memory of being forgotten → present act of composing silence → ending where she keeps going and feels seen. Causality is soft but intact: her choice to stay, compose, and accept Elias’s presence leads to a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration. Structure is clean—a single scene with one reflective inset—and orientation is solid from the outset. The main limitation is the absence of a more sharply defined turn where options or stakes visibly narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: years of pursuit → confrontation in the archive → revelation of the true stakes → alliance and the lock beginning to turn. Orientation is strong from the opening; we know who, where, and what she’s doing very quickly. Closure is present as a clear Decisive Change/Charged Poise—the archway’s lock literally starting to turn—but the conceptual and emotional cost of breaking the seal is under-articulated, making the ending feel more triumphant than fraught. Expository patches about the lost civilization’s fate compress high-stakes information a bit too neatly into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: serum → drumming/memories → break from restraints → flight to garden → drumming climax at the lagoon, with one clear flashback shard that’s well anchored. The drive lens reads Causal with a light lyric overlay, and the ending delivers a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias ceases to be only himself. Stakes (reach lagoon before “universe exhaled”) are legible, though the “universe inhaling/exhaling” clock is more poetic than concretely pressured. Nothing crucial teleports or resets, and closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story is cleanly structured: backstory objects → mysterious map → search through the charged labyrinth → encounter → key-hand-off. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the single-scene frame with embedded memories fits the length. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: they commit to testing how far a whisper can travel, with the labyrinth "waiting for this." The cost of that commitment, however, remains mostly implied rather than concretely articulated, which keeps the ending from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, simple causal beats (dock → light patterns → child’s accusation → silent demonstration → child’s revaluation → reaffirming final image). Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration—Maris has “taught” one more person and recommits to her work, with the child’s whispered “You’re not a witch” as the hinge. The cost is implied more than dramatized (ongoing isolation and misunderstanding rather than a fresh loss), which keeps the arc from feeling truly high-stakes. Still, the before/after is legible and the accumulative/textural lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one evening in the library building to Elias’s departure, driven by whispers and memory. Causality is coherent—whispers → recognition of old threat → preparation (magnets, ledger, displays) → departure—and orientation is strong from the start. Closure functions as Charged Poise: he steps into the night under synchronized signs, with risk implied but not enacted. The piece, however, reads more like a prologue/setup than a self-contained arc, with cost and consequence held in reserve.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: dock work → discovery of the scrimshaw → following the map → island encounter → return transformed. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single temporal/locational transition (docks to sublittoral fringe/island and back) is legible. Closure lands via a decisive change/RR: Lirien’s stance toward herself and her world reconfigures, marked by the scrimshaw’s erasure and her new way of moving through the docks. The main structural limitation is that the crucial explanation about the island’s nature and her mother’s “detachment” is delivered largely as exposition rather than through a pressured choice that might complicate or deepen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural lens: repeated tea rituals, turbines, and the bouquet build toward a quiet closure where his continued speaking is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Causality is clean—mandate → private rebellion → deepened attachment to ritual—and the dream serves as a clear tightening beat. The final morning scene reweights what came before without needing a large external event, and the cost of his stance (isolation, unrelieved grief) lands. Structure is simple but coherent, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival → attunement → intensification (cracking ice, louder hum) → immersion/writing → aftermath/exit. Causality is coherent in an interior sense, and the closure—a resonant reconfiguration where she emerges redefined by the encounter—is legible and satisfying. Stakes remain primarily spiritual/ontological, but the elders’ warnings and prior ban give the choice to enter and surrender some weight. Structure is lucid for a lyric mode and lands its final beat without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: Liora’s arrival and bargain lead to Elias’s experimental painting, Mara’s shard deepens his understanding, and Liora’s return crystallizes the new stance. The causal connections are intact, but the “price” of the bartered awakening feels modest, so the closure reads more as gentle conceptual repricing than a pressured turn. The time progression (day → night → dawn → dusk) is legible and supports an accumulative, almost fable-like rhythm. Closure lands in Elias’s altered relationship to the blank canvas, but without a strong sense of foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: establishing the lab and ritual, then introducing the anomalous hum and closing on a conceptual reframing. The cause-and-effect is legible (his work with the bells and lens primes him to notice and reinterpret the hum), and the single-scene frame holds. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing (the lab was “waiting for the future,” connection “isn’t something to be discovered”), though the final sentence reads slightly truncated and the cost remains more implied than articulated. Structural ambition is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine—mysterious knock → origami coordinates → urban pilgrimage → observatory → re-encounter with Liora—holds cleanly and resolves in an on-page reconfiguration of his relationship to grief. The accumulative, mosaic-like middle (gardens, library, clockmaker) builds a pattern rather than a conventional sequence of obstacles, but the throughline remains coherent. Closure lands as an internal decisive change with cost: he relinquishes a stuck mode of mourning without “getting Liora back.” The main structural weakness is that the mechanism and source of the origami guidance remain entirely off-stage, which slightly dulls the sense of stakes in the middle stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: deck arrives → interpretive work deepens → external message reframes it → final choice and reply. The closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—the final line reframes her lifelong method as the key to a larger, possibly ominous pattern. Causality is mostly solid, but the anonymous deck and texter remain very abstract, so the stakes of stepping “into the map” feel more theoretical than concretely reconfigured. Still, for this length, the single tightening around the phone choice works.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the archive, encounter with Kael, activation of the pagoda, realization and dissolution form a coherent causal chain. The drive reads as Hybrid (causal progression toward a conceptual repricing), and closure lands in the realization that the archive is purifying her rather than vice versa. The cost—relinquishing her grip on the past—is present but mostly conceptual and could be more sharply dramatized in a concrete, contested choice. No major orientation or lens issues, but the hinted dangers of the archive’s pattern-traps never truly test her on the page, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece runs as a single, well-oriented scene with interleaved reflection; who/where/when are legible early, and the library–terminal–shadow triad provides a stable spine. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through layered memory (river, valley, dreams, shadow) until the footage merge and shadow’s solidifying/dissolving reconfigure the situation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias gains partial proof and, more importantly, re-prices what “hope” and “restoration” mean, with some emotional cost for the years spent. Stakes and causality are modest but coherent; nothing feels patched or retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene, present action anchored by concrete tasks, with backstory woven in at clear, motivated points. The central beat—reaching for the adhesive, stopping, and choosing to trim rather than reconstruct—functions as a decisive turn and is causally prepared. Closure lands in a quiet but legible way as he begins to write with a reconfigured stance toward his work and trust. The drive reads as accumulative/textural with a clear final reweighting of his options.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: tower → hourglass crack → awakened garden → tunnel → chamber of frozen hourglasses → coffee and shattering → realization, all in one continuous causal flow. The accumulative/textural drive is clear, with each new space tightening a pattern of frozen/warped time and latent miracles. Closure lands via conceptual repricing—understanding the miracle’s displacement and his role as listener—though stakes remain mostly emotional and somewhat abstract. All set-ups (hourglass, plant-voices, scars) pay off without major orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean arc: extended waiting, psychometric contact with the film, vision of the star/composer and the storage-space for love, then the projector’s activation and Mira’s transcription. Causality is mostly accumulative-textural but still coherent: handling the film leads to visions which lead to the conceptual “storage place” which triggers the booth’s response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mira moves from searching to actively retrieving the song—but the sense of price paid is relatively soft. Structural focus on a single scene with embedded backstory keeps orientation solid.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is straightforward and legible: arrive under archway blocked → invoke stardust memory → use instrument to watch stars → inner release → sleep. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she abandons the tool and allows herself to rest. The causality of the turning point (a star pulses, she remembers the stardust “as a living thing,” and the words just pour out) feels somewhat unearned and convenience-like; there’s little sense of risk or possibility of failure at the climax. Nonetheless, orientation is clean and the before/after in her creative state is clearly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean: guard on dune → discovery of clock → transition to archive → revelation of role → return with reweighted purpose. The single major structural leap (dune to archive) is legible and thematically supported; orientation never wavers. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing: his job’s meaning is reframed, but the cost and concrete implications of this new role remain vague. The piece reads as a well-shaped vignette rather than a fully pressurized story arc.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: sixth sense → journey to mechanical rainforest → discovery of gear → dream of wind → translocation → guardian’s explanation → choice to step into the new frontier. The structure is essentially two to three shards with one major transition, and the story closes on a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist’s stance toward his own mind changes. Cost is present conceptually—abandoning the safety of ordered thought—but it’s only lightly felt on the page. The accumulative/textural drive holds, yet escalation and price could be sharper for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clean: present-time ferry crossing framed by a concise, relevant backstory that explains why Mira is here now. The causal spine (she seeks courage → takes an indirect route with Elias → arrives at a cove of those who mistimed their departures → chooses to step ashore and reframe herself) is coherent but gentle. Closure functions as a quiet resonant reconfiguration: she moves from passive rider to active seeker, with the Ridgeway extending behind as “promise.” The cost of the choice (what she risks or gives up by stepping onto shore) is only faintly implied, keeping this out of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: routine detail → missing bolt → suspicion → confrontation with Veyra → charged final stance, all within a single coherent scene. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the opening and never slips. Closure lands as a quiet but legible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Elias forecloses acquiescence to forgetting, accepting ongoing friction with the fortress. The main limitation is that the cost of this stance remains mostly conceptual rather than made concretely consequential on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Liora follows marginal clues, finds the hidden scroll, recognizes the rune, and forms a plan to topple the pretender via restored truth. The piece delivers a solid Charged Poise closure with her leaving armed with the rune and a clear intention. However, the path is quite smooth—no meaningful setbacks or competing options—and the acquisition of a time-bending sigil faces little on-page resistance. As a result, the decisive reconfiguration of options at the end feels conceptually large but dramatically under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: missing survey paths → torn atlas → AI’s non-answer → three days of reconstruction → discovery of systematic deletions → hidden pages → answering knock and new understanding. Time jumps are legible, and the investigation structure fits the length and lens, culminating in a clear conceptual reconfiguration (the paths were hidden, not gone). The cost is mostly conceptual—no direct confrontation with the eraser or tangible jeopardy—so the closure is strong but not searing. Still, the drive remains coherent and the ending reframes the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves causally from bay → hum → approach → contact → realization. The accumulative drive lens works—pressure builds as the hum intensifies and Lira draws closer to the stones. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets the rebellion’s failure and glimpses a new path, but the cost or concrete consequence of this new stance remains abstract. All anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → decoding → realization of the embryo’s nature → deliberate unsealing → transformed springs and looming conflict with the Council. The structure (present action braided with concise backstory) is clear and well-paced for this length. Closure lands as a decisive change—the embryo dissolved into the earth and a new world-order beginning—and the future pressure from the Council is legible. The main limitation is that most opposition remains off-stage and anticipated, so the cost at closure is more promised than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival/backstory → learning the work → drone-hum crisis → quiet aftermath and reconfiguration. The key tightening is the drone pass and Lena’s freeze, where Mira’s earlier teaching is tested and the orchid becomes an on-page tactic, not just a symbol. Closure is a clear Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s relationship to memory, hope, and the space has shifted in a legible before/after with cost. The arc is more meditative than dramatically intricate, but within that mode, causality and closure are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: grief → discovery of the tarot → physical/metaphorical constriction of the library → surrender → re-emergence into a reconfigured space. Causality is more emotional than event-driven but coherent under a textural lens, and the shrinking library plus redesigned objects lead directly to the charged blackout and reset. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: his world expands again, but the premise has been reweighted and his project has changed. Stakes and cost are legible in that he must let go of the old “blueprint” of his life and relationship to move forward.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: eclipse → drone arrival → child’s crisis → ink message → Elias’s intervention and revelation, culminating in his new, sharpened quest. The piece delivers closure via a Charged Poise: he gains crucial knowledge (time as ink, someone “taking” it) and chooses a future course, though cost is more conceptual than felt. The drive lens reads as hybrid causal/conceptual but stays coherent. The main weakness is that the “they” stealing time remains abstract, so the external antagonistic force and specific stakes beyond this incident feel underdeveloped for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and causal: discovery -> decision to use the letter -> activation of the Mirror -> awareness of the Order’s surveillance -> tactical choice to hide the letter in the oldest chamber. Orientation is excellent from the first lines; time, place, and role are immediately legible. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he has altered the future by seeding the archives and forecloses the path of remaining complicit, with the library’s “sigh” and falling snow registering a conceptual cost. The main limitation is that the Order’s response and the concrete consequences are left entirely offstage, keeping the cost more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scene is cleanly structured: father arrives with a clear agenda (the bounty), the encounter pivots around symbolic exchanges (sandbag, rose), and closes on an earned renunciation (“The bounty would remain unclaimed”). Causality is coherent and legible, and the global drive reads as situational with a quiet but real choice at the end. The closure feels like Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he does not arrest or kill her, and their relationship’s terms shift. The main limitation is that tension resolves a bit swiftly once he steps inside, with little sense of near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: disrupted constellations → dissonant garden → discovery of the void → ritual attempt → cosmic reset, all coherently linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his voicing of silence steadies the sky and garden, with the rail spike as conduit and the world marked as “before/after.” The causal logic is mystical but internally consistent; he acts, and the cosmos responds. The main limitation is that the cost of this act is only implied (possible possession/entanglement) rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the journalist’s call → discovery of archival erasure → decision to intervene → specific tactical letters → new information that the printworks is watched → renewed, riskier commitment at dawn. The piece uses a largely continuous window, with brief but well-anchored temporal jumps (“the next morning,” “at dawn”) that don’t confuse orientation. Closure lands as a charged poise: Elara’s options are reconfigured by the threat, and she nonetheless chooses to step into the light, with the cost implied. There are no dangling set-ups or retroactive patches undermining cohesion at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: haunted lab → translator phrase → backstory via letters → escalation through firmware faces/voices → decisive act of tattooing → earned quiet. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new manifestation of the haunting pressing him closer to embodiment of guilt. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses to carry the past in his skin rather than flee it, and the cries recontextualize from accusation to something answered. The only minor limitation is how swiftly the cries stop once he acts, softening the sense of ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, with a clear build from mandala work → disruption by the tile → Maren’s challenge → revelation of the grotto’s nature → decisive act with the flake. Causality is coherent and legible even within a lyric, accumulative frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from trying to impose pattern to collaboratively “listening” with the grotto via the tile, with the glowing lines as the after-image. The cost—recognizing the weight of the town’s unsaid and her own prior misframing—is implicit but could be edged into sharper relief.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored by the stepping stone discovery that tightens into a choice at the end. Backstory about the great fire and Amira is efficiently woven through present action and clearly motivates the closing decision. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis / Charged Poise moment: she refuses erasure and commits to rebuilding with the name intact, reconfiguring her stance toward the past. A slightly sharper sense of what concretely changes tomorrow (beyond the vow) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias waits for solitude, uses the coin, fractures time, creates echoes, and leverages them to offer Liora a new possibility, culminating in her decision to accept. Structure is tight—a single continuous scene—and the rules of the magic are sketched through action rather than exposition. Closure lands as a charged poise: her taking his hand reconfigures what “impossible” means, with an implied emotional cost but no sharply articulated price. The drive feels primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, and that lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain—pill → static shock → strange impressions → deliberate experiment → first foreign memory → acceptance—is clean and easy to follow. The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Mara’s stance reorients from “reverse” to “live with,” with the “Prove it” callback sealing the before/after. However, the path is relatively smooth: little goes wrong, and no attempt truly backfires or forces a costly trade-off. The structure is solid for length, but escalation and cost remain modest, keeping it below elite-tier tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: Eira is drawn to the caves, the presence escalates from dreams to physical manifestation, and the encounter culminates in her transformation, with a legible before/after. The piece reads mainly as accumulative/textural with a causal throughline, and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—she wakes changed, with new capacity to “answer.” Stakes remain somewhat abstract (no on-page consequences for refusal, no external pressures beyond the numinous), which keeps the structural tension from fully tightening. Still, there are no real causality breaks or orientation issues, and the ending pays off what was set up.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: buttons → prophecy → final button → hourglass reversal → conceptual repricing of prophecy. Causality is legible under a textural lens, and the piece lands a real closure beat in Mira’s deliberate re-turning of the glass and redefinition of the prophecy’s purpose. Stakes are mainly conceptual and emotional, not practical, and pressure never feels urgent, which keeps the arc from fully tightening. Still, for a quiet lyric piece, the before/after of how prophecy functions in her life is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: codes in the snow → return to the bluff → opening the pillbox → key → door → file → decision to take up abandoned agents’ cause. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid: he forecloses his prior self-exile and accepts the burden of others’ missions, with the cost implied in the scale of what he pockets. The single-scene structure is tight, with no orientation issues and a clear before/after in his stance toward his past. The main limitation is that opposition is almost entirely internal, so the path from key to door to file faces little friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one scene, one POV, and a coherent accumulative build from foggy approach → storm → rope repair → crossing → revelation of the far bank. The drive lens is primarily Accumulative/Textural, and the closure is an Earned Stasis/RR as he moves from "time running out" to "for the first time in years, he felt no weight, no urgency." Causality is simple but intact—storm threatens rope, needle repairs rope, ferry can cross—though the practical danger never feels truly acute. The cost at closure is more conceptual/emotional than plot-based, but it's legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival/work with clay → recollection of training and pattern-reading → observation of time-fracture signs → ritual at the hive → conceptual revelation and transformed objects. Causality is soft but coherent; his deliberate act of setting the bowl, lighting the fire, and listening bridges to the oasis’s revelation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—“It wasn’t holding on. It was remembering.”—with the restored lantern and honey as proof. The main limitation is a light sense of cost; the world and Ren’s options don’t visibly change in a way that bites.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is straightforward and coherent: rooftop tending → Lila’s arrival → revelation of the father’s death → transfer of the tool → quiet internal shift. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds appropriately toward the gift of the gauge tooth and Elias’s new stance on endings. Closure is solid as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with a clear before/after in his relationship to loss and inheritance. The stakes and turns remain modest, so the arc feels polished but not yet indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design: each beat deepens Lira’s relationship to the sundial, memory, and library rather than moving through sharp causal turns. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the through-line—from hum to sundial to book to reframed independence—coheres without breaks. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines independence as carrying the past forward, signaled by closing the book with a lighter heart. However, escalation is gentle and the sense of “before/after” is more conceptual than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—temple → keeper’s suggestion → installation → night letter → mirror return—forms a coherent causal chain even in a lyric mode. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Mira finally sees herself and the twig in the mirror, reweighting the earlier quest for a “pattern” into a recognition of an always-present thread. The cost is quiet but legible: relinquishing the safety of being only a conduit for others’ secrets. Transitions are clean, with no orientation confusion or major causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous signals → Mara infers tricksters → chooses a subtle counter-signal → confronts Voss’s doubt → activates the generator → patterns and campus tension ease. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands via a decisive act (activating the signal) with a clear before/after in both the charts and the campus mood. However, given the cosmic scale invoked, the solution arrives a bit too smoothly and cheaply—no complication once the plan is in motion, and the tricksters’ power never tests her tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean early: who he is, where he is, and why he’s there all land within the opening. The causal chain is straightforward and coherent: investigation → sound → figure → offer → acceptance → revelation, with no plot amnesia or teleporting elements. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing of the Nexus and “spatial mutiny,” with the compass as a clear hinge, though the price of this new knowledge is mostly implied rather than dramatized. The scene fits the single-beat, single-POV scope very well.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: clue at quarry → encounter with sister → revelation of lance and corruption → reframing of the case and Elara’s purpose, all contained in one continuous scene. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with Elara’s shift from solving a puzzle to restoring personhood landing clearly in the final image of the sketch. Stakes are more conceptual than situational—there’s no strong immediate danger or time pressure—but the narrative drive (what happened to Liora / what Elara will do about it) remains coherent. No major causality or orientation slips, though the investigative line stays at a conceptual stage rather than executing a tangible next step.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival for journals → discovery of marginalia → reinterpretation of exile → revelation about the nail → furnace passage → revaluation of Elias’s role. Closure works as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: learning Elias was “sent” reweights everything and sharpens the question of whether she’ll follow. Stakes and cost at the end remain mostly conceptual—no concrete consequence is forced on the page, which keeps this just below top-tier. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; the structure fits the length with no confusing jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clean: music → recollection of hitchhiker and flake → re-seeing the valley → quiet decision to move on, with a Charged Poise closure. Causality is soft but coherent—reflection arises from present stimuli and feeds back into her stance toward the road. The closure moment (choosing the luminous, answerless road with the relic in her case) lands, but the cost is gentle and largely conceptual. Structure is elegant for a lyric piece, though a sharper hinge or consequence would lift it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene at the train with backstory interleaved, all oriented toward understanding cyclical paths. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/situational lens: past (father’s robberies, startup) → present contemplation at the train → conceptual shift as he chooses to leave. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external event, and the before/after is legible with emotional cost. The main limitation is that no external pressure or on-page consequence tightens the screws on his decision, keeping escalation relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: telegram and prior dreams → mounting pressure → present-moment witnessing → reinterpretation of the inscriptions → decision to gather the dreamers. The single-scene frame with interleaved recollection is structurally sound and easy to follow. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the inscriptions reframe from puzzle to invitation, and his role reconfigures from recorder to facilitator. The cost of this shift is only lightly implied, so the ending feels more like a poised beginning than a hard, paid-for change.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: failed magic → test with the seed → the seed demands truth → confession → revelation in the bone mirror → curse partially lifts with a new, darker knowledge. Orientation is solid early, and the single-scene structure with embedded memories stays coherent under a causal lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: the curse shifts, but the true “resolution” is Veyra’s new, more damning understanding of her past. A small weakness is that the plant’s mechanics expand late (mirror, kin reveal) without prior foreshadowing, though they don’t break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: clipping → encounter with the woman → touch of the scar → transition to the dream intersection where the covenant can be remade. Orientation is solid and the two-shard structure (glade, then star-strewn plain) is legible, with no causality breaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias chooses to join her and believes in the possibility of renewing the covenant. The main limitation is that the cost of this choice (what he’s truly risking or leaving) is only lightly implied, which softens structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: Liora’s prior preparations → encounter with the stranger → price revealed → decision to give up the memory, with no orientation issues. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: she trades the core memory and walks away under a new, heavier status quo. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a situational flavor, and it holds through the ending. Escalation is modest but coherent; a bit more on-page consequence of the bargain (even subtle) could further sharpen the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: quarry trailer → backstory → present-day cataloging with Roy → night visit to the pit → encounter with Lena and reframed self-perception. Causality is straightforward—his fallen status leads to the quarry, which leads to the pit and the “haunting” sound, culminating in the Lena meeting that reconfigures his trajectory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with a clear before/after (“listening to an echo” vs “listening to the future”), though the coincidence of Lena’s appearance is lightly handled and feels a bit convenient rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal arc is clean and legible: investigation → insertion of the seed → arbor’s activation → partial reconnection/translation, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rule-set around death/transition is reweighted on the page (“Somewhere, in the space between physics and faith, a connection had been reestablished”), and the before/after is clear. That said, the cost is conceptual more than dramatic—her success comes without true threat or sacrifice, so the climax reads more like a successful experiment than a hard-won turning point. The structure is elegant and self-contained but emotionally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: the creel calls, he reads and fills it, then releases it, and this sequence holds to a single, legible throughline. Orientation is strong from the opening—who he is, where we are, how the sea and moon function—so there’s no spatial or temporal confusion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the creel is reconceived as a vessel for in-between identities, and the release reframes his role from keeper to sender. The main limitation is that the decisive change feels more conceptual than pressured, with relatively low on-page cost or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrive → discover confessions → use the pearl to dissolve them → discover crown and hidden confession → confront her own fear, with each step causally linked. The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where her role shifts from inspector of others’ fears to participant, at the cost of her own guardedness and the pearl’s power. No major orientation issues; who/where/when is clear early. The only limit is that external stakes remain low and the “inspector” frame never faces any material test beyond the internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous visit to the station and bathroom, with reflection anchored in present cues (graffiti lines, map, accordion). Causality is soft but coherent: past failure → obsessive map → retreat to station → engagement with graffiti → reframed aim at the end. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she crystallizes a new stance and steps toward the river with that burden. The cost—remaining with unalleviated guilt and abandoning the hope of forgiveness—is clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → navigation of the library → encounter with the blank book → writing/reading the second letter → conceptual realization and exit. Causality in a literal sense is soft, but under an accumulative/textural lens the closure works: the watch chiming, cipher “clicking into place,” and the library’s revealed nature form a legible before/after. The cost is largely conceptual (reframing time, fate, and the “unspoken”) rather than dramatized through loss or genuine risk, which limits impact. Still, the piece lands a real conceptual repricing and reads structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival with a goal → first note → plant outcry and coffee-stain vision → father’s intervention → her decisive playing that alters reality. Closure lands with a clear before/after: she chooses the dream, her father/empire is effectively removed from the scene, and the prophetic image rewrites into an open future. The story keeps a single, coherent drive lens and one dominant stake, with no orientation issues despite the high-concept elements. The one slight softness is the unexplained mechanism of the father “vanished into the twilight,” which feels more atmospheric than fully dramatized as consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story is structurally clean: one continuous scene, clear orientation, and a contained arc from arrival to ritual to brief revival and renewed vow. As an accumulative/lyric piece, it builds atmosphere more than event, but there is still a discernible tightening around whether the spark will hold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Liora’s role at the threshold is reaffirmed in light of this success, with the cost being that the reprieve is explicitly temporary. What’s missing is a sharper turn or complication in the middle; the ritual works on the first attempt and the outcome never feels seriously in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: tree/top-world shard to subterranean grotto shard, each causally linked through the hairpin and Mira’s search for contentment. The closure is a clear conceptual reconfiguration—Mira reframes where contentment resides—and this is anchored in a concrete act (relinquishing the hairpin) and a before/after walk back into the vineyards. The causal spine is simple but coherent; the main cap is that the revelation via the voice and reflection feels a bit too straightforward and unresisted for top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: Elias arrives with a clear job, engages Veyra, uses conversation as the primary engine, and reaches a reweighted understanding by sunrise. Under a Situational/Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres around whether Elias will render a verdict or allow ambiguity, culminating in his question, “Tell me what you’re afraid of.” Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: the lighthouse’s function is conceptually repriced from tribunal to shared space of uncertainty, and Elias’s mandate subtly changes. Stakes and cost are philosophically scaled rather than narratively sharp, but they are legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from preparation through trance to transformation, with the grotto hum and frozen ripples as clear escalations. Causality within the accumulative/ritual frame holds: her admission of fear and surrender to the grotto’s pull lead to the rings halting and the step outside time. Closure lands via a decisive change in both understanding and apparent age, so before/after is legible. The conceptual cost—what she “undoes” or leaves behind—could be more sharply articulated on the page, which keeps this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Elias studies the flock → spots the disruption → investigates the tower → uses the arrowhead → enters the chamber and activates the skimmer → gains understanding. The piece reads under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure (conceptual shift to “moving without motion,” choosing to remain) is on the page. Cost is implied more than dramatized; the “forever” wandering is evocative but not felt as a hard sacrifice in-scene. Still, for this length, the single tightening around the birds’ pattern and door discovery works well.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: climb → keystone touch → “unstrap” command → threshold shift → mist-walk → fountain → drink → return with a drop of light → flower. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the two-scene structure (outside/inside/return) is legible without confusion. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s stance toward magic and worth shifts, and we see a concrete behavioral pivot in how he uses the last of the old magic. The main limitation is that obstacles inside the spire resolve with minimal resistance, so the middle reads as a guided vision more than a pressured sequence of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal line is clean: key tag → unease → purposeful wandering → sunken library → woman + second key → lantern-sky revelation → handing over Lumen. The piece lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reinterprets his role and legacy and relinquishes the tag. That said, the “truth” he’s supposedly been hiding behind is vague, so the before/after reconfiguration is more conceptual than felt and the cost is muted. Structure (two main locations under one continuous night) is tidy and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece runs as a single reflective scene whose logic is accumulative: coins, lots, static, and prophecy circle until the realization that it’s “backwards” reconfigures everything. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy becomes a mirror, and the universe’s “voice” is reframed, with Elias’s final readiness to listen marking a before/after. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens; each element meaningfully returns at the end. The main limitation is that the cost and external implications of his shift stay subdued, making the climax intellectually strong but somewhat low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: observatory and atlas → recordings as groundwork → activation of the monsters → naming and beam of light → reweighted stasis at the end. Causality is legible, and the closure—Elias feeling lighter, the dead finally silent, the page rewritten—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural and holds consistently. Stakes remain mostly internal, but the piece still lands a coherent before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by concise backstory, with a clear causal chain (study drips → mend bell → strike bell → fish return → revaluation of goal). Orientation is excellent from the first sentence; who/where/when are all quickly legible. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the world is still tilting, but Elias’s understanding of what “rebuilding” means shifts, reweighting the prior imagery of drops and silence. The only limitation is that the montage of “weeks watching water fall” is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the sense of accumulating on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: resurfacing town → found bottle/label → trail of photographs → distillery confrontation → decision about what to do with the evidence. Structure is linear and legible, with backstory anchored in present stimuli (photos, reservoir) and feeding the final choice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Elias commits to exposing and integrating the past rather than erasing it, with the cost implied in challenging the town’s and his father’s stories. The piece could escalate the immediate stakes of that choice a bit more sharply on the page to deepen the felt before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with a clear before/after: she enters the orchard seeking an answer before the “final transformation” and leaves having reconfigured her stance toward magic. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the crystals, fire memory, and starlings build coherently toward a Conceptual Repricing where she abandons strict control in favor of felt experience. Closure lands on the page—pressing the crystal into the earth and stepping back through the waterfall—but the external frame (“world’s magic” solidifying/dissolving) remains abstract and never materially tightens her options. The result is elegant but low in felt cost, capping the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece tracks as one continuous scene with well-sequenced beats: initial perch, gear improvisation, partial descent, near-fall, and renewed ascent. Causality is clean under a situational/causal hybrid lens, and the vine/buckle solution pays off in the snap-and-catch moment. Closure lands as a modest Decisive Change/Charged Poise—he recommits to climbing and trusting his devised system with the city closer. The cost is present but relatively light and the broader consequences of success/failure stay abstract, which keeps this just short of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael comes to feel again, rejects the shortcut of the duplicate brain, submits to Veyra’s training, and through the escalating fight reconfigures his relationship to numbness, culminating in his deliberate step off the dojo. Closure is strong: his stance shifts from “I don’t want to be numb” to accepting numbness as “canvas,” and that new stance directly fuels the final action, with the cost being abandonment of his protective identity. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with one reflective insert, and no major set-ups are left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious packages → planting the seed → threatening notes and photo → redesign of the room → explicit warning and poised confrontation. The structure is essentially linear with small time jumps, and orientation is solid from the opening sentence. Closure lands as a charged poise rather than a decisive outcome—Lena chooses to face the oncoming threat in darkness as the flower blooms—and that before/after is legible, if somewhat metaphorically weighted. The one weakness is how vague “they” and their concrete aims remain, which slightly blurs the stakes of that final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, causally linked—he plays, the family’s response shifts, the blower falters, he recommits, and laughter returns. The dominant drive lens reads as hybrid with an accumulative tilt: each pass of the sound through the tunnel and each prior visit builds toward the final reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the household’s silence is transformed into laughter, and Elias relinquishes control, walking away with his task completed. Cost is present but relatively soft and quiet (he gives up his role and anonymity rather than facing a sharp irreversible decision).

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal line: pendant → garden → guardian → book → realization, under a largely accumulative/textural lens. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she moves from lifelong waiting to a stance that no longer requires it, with the cost being her acceptance of unresolved longing. Stakes stay small and interior, but the before/after is legible and the scaffolding holds without structural breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: reflection on long-term failure → conceptual turn → deliberate catastrophic experiment → aftermath and new shard as closure. Causality is solidly motivated—his realization about purpose leads directly to the destructive act. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of alchemy and his life’s work, with the loss of the crozier and the ruined workshop embodying cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: anomaly → use of fragment → contact with the voice → methodological shift → transcendence as the tower falls. Closure is solid: Mira’s choice to retune toward silence rather than signal leads to her disappearance and the reweighted final image of the fragment in the wreckage, a clear before/after. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural but causality holds, and the perigee and tower collapse provide a credible ticking clock and physical endpoint. The only limitation is that the cost of her choice, while implied, remains more conceptual than dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clear: clocks go sideways → ferry begins vanishing → echoes appear → Elias uses hourglass/patterns plus his address to help them merge, after which the crisis resolves. The scene stays in one continuous window with no orientation issues and lands a legible closure (the commuters gone, the ferry stabilized). However, the mechanism of resolution is fairly soft—he speaks, things shimmer, and it works—so cost and constraint at the climax feel light. The structure is solid but not yet at the intricate, high-stakes level that would feel immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story tracks cleanly from discovery of the thread to reality-warping illusions to the threshold-crossing door and entry into the void; causal beats are legible and the pattern is accumulative/textural. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the world reconfigures so that “connection” becomes literal and tactile, with Elias effectively exiting ordinary reality. However, the cost of that transition (what is forfeited by leaving the gallery/world) is only lightly implied, not concretely dramatized. Structure is coherent and elegant but lacks a sharper pivot where options narrow with explicit consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: aliens arrive → Lirien’s dissatisfaction with old navigation → salvaged link → experiments → on-page observation → conceptual shift and declaration. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one temporal spread, and the ending offers a clear conceptual reconfiguration (the deep versus the stars) that reads as closure. The main weakness is that key turns (like the realization that stars are a language) arrive quickly and somewhat comfortably, with little sense of risk or real obstacle. Still, there are no causality breaks or confusing transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: hearing-aid pulses → Elias’s appearance and warning → revelation that “they” take listeners → Miriam’s voice calling → Lena’s run into the mist. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous scene with a single, legible escalation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lena chooses to accept the cost of entering the dead’s space, framed as her true vocation. The cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized, so the final beat feels earned but not fully devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: codex → secret route → discovery of the researchers’ state → phase-transition crossing → choice to remain. The piece lands an Earned Stasis/RR closure: Elias forecloses escape by staying as the phase transition reverses and the station dies, with cost made explicit. Structure is linear and tight for the length, with one clear escalation point at the membrane crossing. Some world mechanics (what exactly the other state entails) remain abstract, but they don’t break coherence under a causal-plus-conceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a man in an observatory, a digital ghost’s appearance, a brief exchange that reframes his relationship to borrowed time, and a quiet, resonant exit line. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—Elias’s history motivates his retreat here, and the ghost’s prompts nudge a conceptual shift rather than a plot twist. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: his life is reweighted in relation to his mistakes and mortality, with the “stars” watching as a widened frame. The cost—living on without the talismanic burden of his own death certificate—is implied rather than strongly dramatized, keeping this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → experiment with diamond in tunnel → echoes respond → capture → re-emergence with reweighted understanding. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is solid; each step follows from the last, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing of what language/echoes are. However, cost at closure is minimal—rumors of madness never test her, and success comes without a hard trade-off—so the decisive change feels largely conceptual rather than pressured. Still, as a self-contained lyric-scene, it lands coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story tracks cleanly from investigation to confrontation to transformation, with the arrowhead and phone serving as consistent causal anchors. The closure is a clear Decisive Change: Elias chooses not to “let it go” and metamorphoses, accepting the invitation of the static. Structure is tight and coherent for a single-scene piece, though the final metamorphosis comes in a single abrupt sentence where a slightly more articulated beat of consequence could deepen the sense of cost. The “missing return” setup pays off conceptually but could be tethered more explicitly to his unique risk in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is largely clean: the shell’s pulse leads to a new musical tactic, which restrains the statues long enough for escape, which leads to the encounter with the child and the reapplication of that rhythm in the mechanical world. Closure is solid: Liora has shifted from maintaining a fragile status quo to embracing a risky, outward-facing fight for beauty, with the statues and ruined city as ongoing pressures. The main weakness is the slightly under-explained leap from “shell pulses” to “this is a key whose rhythm can break my bond,” which reads as convenient intuition rather than earned deduction. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear orientation, and a soft but legible closure where Jace commits to carrying undeliverable things a while longer. Causality is modest—Mira arrives with a smuggling task, which motivates the jammer, the blackout, and Jace’s choice to bring the bottled storm—but pressure never quite sharpens into a concrete test or fork. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with a situational edge, and it’s consistently held. Closure has conceptual cost but not much dramatized consequence, keeping this below elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: wrong turn → discovery of halo → song → train animates → oasis/carousel → restoring halo completes the magic and carries him “home.” The piece reads as Hybrid (causal events in a lyric, accumulative atmosphere), and closure lands with a clear before/after when the dead circus reawakens. However, there is almost no felt price or constraint resisting this progression; everything unfolds as a single smooth escalation of wonder. That absence of friction prevents the structure from feeling fully consequential at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear and legible: scarf → spatial shift → hyperbolic-geometry door → story-void → reunion → reset with a recharged status quo. The piece lands a true closure via resonant reconfiguration—Elias now occupies a world where the place stories live is no longer hypothetical, and the scarf’s meaning is altered. However, the cost of this discovery is underdeveloped; they slip back into the library with no visible loss, sacrifice, or new limitation. Structurally it’s tidy and self-contained but emotionally low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: finding the palette → painting with light → intensified dreams → turn to photography → successful capture → journey and encounter. The accumulative structure of repeated dawn attempts builds toward a clear closure image and a Charged Poise ending (“Not yet. But I will.”). Causality holds and the transitions between phases are smooth, though obstacles are minimal and the quest feels almost too frictionless. Cost at closure is implied (risking his old life for the unknown) rather than sharply articulated, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Elara’s offering → the locksmith’s ritual at the nexus → the idea’s release → the return to Elara with an imperative. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the village’s future has been altered by freeing the founding truth. However, the decisive consequences are entirely projected onto “that was a tale for another time,” so cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. The structure (two linked beats: nexus, then return) is tidy and coherent but stops just before the most volatile turn.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: childhood encounter → adult gap and investigations → star-pattern discovery → return to greenhouse → memory surge → portal opening/failed reunion. The causal chain (detecting broken constellations leading him back to the ring) is legible and satisfying under a causal lens. Closure lands as a charged loss—the portal closes, the sister is re-lost, and the lone fading mushroom cap crystallizes the cost. A slight whiff of convenience in the stellar alignment clue keeps it short of exceptional, but the story maintains coherence and stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene moving from solitude → intrusion → testing → partial opening, with all beats causally linked. The inferred drive is Hybrid leaning Accumulative—pressure accrues through repeated motifs (shadow, walking backward, swing) rather than big plot turns, and closure lands as a Charged Poise when Elara gives Mira the teacup. The reversible exile frame sets up a larger possibility space, though the scene never quite puts her departure meaningfully “in play.” The emotional cost at the end is legible on the page, but the decisive change remains relatively small in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal throughline—seed found, planted, sung over, sprouting into a world-bridging tree—is clean and legible, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard and its stories are restored on the page. The structure is essentially one continuous ritual scene, appropriate to the scale. The main limitation is that success feels foregone once the seed pulses and responds; there’s little sense that events could go otherwise or extract a sharper price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the sanctuary, establishing the mask and net, the progressive untying of knots with escalating voice-release, then confrontation and decisive act. Causality holds under a mostly causal lens (unraveling knots deepens silence, which heightens danger and charges the final stab). Closure is present as a Decisive Change when Elias drives the needle into the mask despite the King’s warning, with implied consequences. A slightly clearer articulation of what that last act might unleash would strengthen the sense of cost without needing explicit exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: map tear and whispers → old stories → inherited footage → disturbing comparison → decision to reopen → discovery of the shoe and repricing of the map. The two-shard structure (vault vs. henge/chapel) is legible and well-paced, and orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Closure works as Conceptual Repricing: the torn map and the whispers are reweighted by the final realization that the story is ongoing. The cost remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized in immediate consequences, which keeps this short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: wreck discovery → library and globe → logs/Project Icarus → Liora’s apparition → revelation of the globe as a temporal “last transmission” → decision to shatter it. The structure is a clean single scene with one deepening turn (the ghostly physicist and the key revelation) and a decisive act that visibly changes the situation (the ship’s “release”). Closure is solid—a conceptual and situational before/after is legible with cost (the erasure/untangling of the experiment’s hold on time), though the real-world stakes remain more metaphysical than urgent. Orientation is strong throughout; there are no confusing jumps or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: courtyard → graffiti → realization of a “ghost in code” → musical attempt to answer the plea → use of the bolt plate as key → brief embodiment and release. Causality is clean under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the single scene escalates toward the lightning/thunder moment without digression. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost’s stake is resolved (“Enough”), and Elias’s understanding of what his music can do is altered. Stakes are modest but fully resolved on the page, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: elevator ascent → discovery/decoding of the diary → confrontation → renunciation, with clear because/therefore links under a largely situational lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Lira foregoes further intrusion, returns the goggles, and the captain quietly re-engages her grief. The cost—Lira relinquishing intimacy and answers that mattered to her—is legible on the page. It’s solidly built, though the conflict remains small-scale and the turns are somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that accumulates pressure through reflection until the sighting of the Astraea reorients Elias’s options and leads directly to his jump. Causality is intact under a mostly accumulative lens: long-term cloud work → telescope as conduit → storm focus → ship revelation → decision to “let go.” Closure lands on-page with a decisive, high-cost action, and the before/after is legible. The only slight weakness is that the storm’s timing and the “three days since the string broke” feel more like poetic givens than sharpened plot constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: rumor → coin → map → safe → sketch → decision. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis when she chooses to leave the drawing. Closure is present and legible, but the demolition clock and the uniqueness of the sketch could exert stronger pressure; the sense of what is irretrievably lost remains more conceptual than felt. Still, the scene resolves its central line of action in an orderly, satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: starlings → phrasebook phrase → hopscotch pattern → lantern → realization → ship changes course. The structure (evening observation / night investigation / morning reveal) is tidy and easy to track, with a clear closure unit when the Drifter banks onto a new, unmapped wind. The drive lens is primarily causal with an accumulative motif pattern and holds consistently. The main limitation is that the closure carries little visible cost, so while structurally sound, it stops short of feeling tectonic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain is clean: gears → need for rhythm → hall of mirrors → vision → realization about the clockmaker and time. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear closure beat in the final realization about repair as remembering. However, the decisive change is mostly conceptual, with little on-page cost or resistance; Elias acquires understanding without serious setback or trade-off. The result is structurally sound but somewhat low-tension for the ambitions implied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: sick orchard → Liora’s decision to communicate → villagers’ experiments and changed behavior → orchard recovery → Liora’s fading. Closure is solid and legible; her fading after success is a clear Decisive Change / Earned Stasis with an emotional cost on the page. The accumulative pattern of dawn messages is well-structured, but the process faces remarkably little resistance—once the messages appear, the shift in communal behavior happens almost frictionlessly, which slightly softens narrative tension. Still, for this length, the structure is coherent, purposeful, and lands its ending.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulating scene where the final ripple of time forces Elias to make a different use of the tools he’s long tended. Causality is coherent—the years of turning the clock back, the study of the pane, and the arrival of the last ripple all converge on the choice to hum the lullaby. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: he stops adjusting the clock, accepts uncertainty about the end, and reorients from prevention to comfort with a felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear: curse → blueprint → nuts-as-map → urgent need to prevent another loss → indirect rescue of the man. The structure balances a brief retrospective (finding the blueprint) with present-tense action under a time constraint, and closure lands in the Earned Stasis mode (the curse holds; her role continues, slightly reconfigured). Stakes and rules remain consistent, and the final beat refers back to the opening image, giving a satisfying loop. The only ceiling comes from the relative modesty of the decisive change—her tactic shifts, but the situation itself barely evolves.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, accumulative reflection triggered by setting details, leading to a clear internal turn and decision. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: observation of foam → reframe of permanence → shift in research direction and relational stance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt cost (abandoning her old illusion of control and re-entering the world she almost left). The stakes stay modest and mostly internal, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece reads as a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with clear causal linking (lull → first customer → transaction → bottle’s transformation → her disappearance → conceptual reframing). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the loss of the bottled moonlight and the open door to the cloud-sea reweight “where stories begin” as a charged poise rather than a location. The curator’s “quantifying absence” line is paid off indirectly via the emphasis on absence and fading, not as method but as frame. Structural integrity is strong; the only limitation is that pressure changes are low-key, so the decisive turn feels quiet rather than sharply pivoted.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: fortress → pavilion → finding Kael → emotional confrontation via touch → joint exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael leaves the “tomb” and the pavilion’s warmth reframes grief as promise, with clear before/after. Stakes remain focused and coherent, though the “subdue the fortress’s last guest” hook resolves into a gentler counseling beat than the initial phrasing implies. The structure is straightforward but solidly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: overheard silo loneliness → plan to repurpose the tower → mechanical restoration → multilingual invitation → successful gathering → sustained community. Structure is straightforward, with a quick time jump to “weeks passed” that maintains coherence while slightly softening immediacy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the tower is now a communal heartbeat and the silos are conceptually bridged. The cost, however, is barely dramatized—Mara’s effort and any risks she faces are mostly implied, limiting structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: find object → attempt to work on it → encounter memory → make a different-than-planned choice. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through increasingly charged interactions with the mirror and canyon until the final renunciation. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration—Lena shifts from modifier to curator with a visible opportunity cost. The only constraint is that structural stakes remain small and wholly internal, so the arc, while clean, doesn’t quite achieve a larger-scale inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: entry into grotto → escalation of threshold effects → discovery of the book → realization and exit, with a coherent before/after in her self-understanding. Causality within the fantastical parameters holds, and the hour of inversion provides a loose frame that closes. However, the cost of the closure (taking on guardianship, secrecy) remains mostly conceptual and lightly felt, and the path is very smooth—no meaningful risk of failure or real complication to her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: discovery → testing → tool introduction → refinement → first fragile melody → quiet revaluation of the grove. Causality is intact and legible, with each choice (especially inserting the insulator and analyzing the cracks) leading to the next beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the grove is “no longer silent,” with the hedgehog as witness. The cost of this change is underplayed, so while the arc feels complete, it doesn’t fully register as a hard-before/after in terms of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear early: who Elias is, where we are, and what he wants at the nexus. The piece follows a clean causal spine—arrival with a goal, encounter with Lysara, joint ritual, conceptual revelation, and a quiet decision to remain. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant reframes his exile and confirms his path. The main limitation is that the path to revelation feels relatively unopposed and convenient, with Lysara arriving as a well-timed complement rather than a complicating force.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: desire to unlock the diary → careful nonviolent attempts → interruption by Liora → her gift of the tuning fork → opening and thematic reveal. Structure stays within a single, legible scene and lands a clear closure unit (conceptual repricing plus decisive change with the diary opening and thesis line). The main weakness is that Liora’s arrival feels like a benevolent coincidence that removes difficulty rather than a pressure that forces a costly choice. As a result, the resolution is satisfying but somewhat low-torque for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with causal links—Mira with the seed, Nara’s warning, the grandmother’s journal, then Mira’s reinterpreted commitment. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “success” means (bloom vs. waiting), and the before/after is legible. Still, the supposed peril of the corpse flower and the rarity of the “turning of the tide’s thought” never materially constrain options, so the climax operates on a relatively low-pressure plane. The piece reads more like an elegant vignette than a story that must end this way and no other.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: impending gravity inversion → need to navigate via waterways → discovery of strange grove → encounter with echoes → conceptual shift at the inversion. Structure is tight and single-scene, with the closure landing as a Conceptual Repricing of what “resilience” means. Cost is mainly conceptual and atmospheric rather than dramatized in concrete loss or risk, which keeps the stakes feeling modest despite the planetary premise. All set-ups (arrow tip, inversion, echoes) do pay off, even if a bit gently.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is tight: a single, continuous investigation that escalates from eerie quiet to active entrapment, with each discovery causally feeding the next (strange wind → moving figure → heat signature → realization → failed escape). The closure is a clear Decisive Change—Elias goes from investigator with options to trapped witness to a transforming machine-city. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/situational lens; nothing important teleports or resets. The only thing keeping it from a higher band is the relative simplicity of the choice architecture—he mainly shifts from observing to fleeing, without more complex tactical branching.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with chisel strikes disrupting the attempt to unleash the music, culminating in success when she rings the largest bell. Causality is straightforward—the chisel interferes with hush, forcing her to push harder, and her final act triggers the decisive release of the song. Closure lands clearly with the sculptor’s chisel falling silent and the music transforming the cavern, though the external conflict resolves a bit conveniently with minimal visible price. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and that pattern holds consistently through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: last guardian’s fall → flute as only clue → driftwood path → cavern → encounter with figure → reframing of boundary → new use of flute that alters the tear. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear closure unit: realizing the boundary is a thread and enacting that via the melody. The main weakness is that the transition from “trying to seal” to “weaving” is conceptually strong but operationally too smooth—there’s no real failure or setback in this scene once the figure explains the flute’s purpose. Cost is implied in the conceptual gamble of stitching worlds together, but no concrete on-page consequence tests this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: workshop → fragment activation → visitor → fragment’s dissolution → cosmic blackout, with each beat causally following the last. The closure—last star gone, fragment lost, equations remaining—functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the whole experiment with a clear cost (cosmic and personal). However, the woman’s arrival and the fragment’s sudden dissolution feel more like mythic intrusions than tightly motivated turns, so the stakes deepen atmospherically more than through sharply defined options. The accumulative drive holds, but escalation stems more from pattern intensification than explicit decision-led causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one contiguous scene, clear inciting encounter (the stranger), and a closure beat that reconfigures her role. Causality is modest but intact: humming pendant → approach of stranger → revelation of threshold → inner decision. Closure is a conceptual repricing of her work and the relic, with a discernible before/after. The cost and consequences remain somewhat abstract, so the final turn lands more as mood than as a hard-choice pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: frost patterns → discovery of the grieving man → deliberate journey to the arbor → communion via prism → conceptual reframe. The causal links are legible enough under a textural lens, and the memory-vision of the previous man’s grief cleanly precedes Elias’s realization. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing of his theory, with a felt, if quiet, before/after. The stakes are modestly scaled and never sharply tightened, which keeps the structure from feeling fully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: message → decision to leave → journey guided by the puzzle → city → discovery of Kael’s remains → reframed understanding. The structure is essentially two shards (orchard and journey / city) with a smooth transition and a strong Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the long journey is mostly summarized and relatively frictionless, which softens the sense of narrowing options and concrete on-page tests of the “last light” clock. Closure still lands with cost and coherence, but the middle lacks one sharper tactical complication that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear and linear: orchards dying → Elias’s diagnosis → using the magician’s silk in the mine → fissure sealed → implied recovery. Orientation is strong and the single-scene structure (with brief backstory) is easy to track, and closure (RR/DC hybrid) lands on-page with the sealed fissure and his changed stance. The main weakness is the low friction in execution: the silk responds almost perfectly, and the “mine groaning” never converts into an actual complication or narrowing of options. As a result, cost and danger feel modest, keeping escalation and closure from maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation and causal flow are clean: dreams → arrival at nexus → scanner misbehavior → arrival of other Kael → gate activation → forced choice. The piece clearly builds to the decision to “redirect the flow, or let the truth remain withheld,” so the drive lens reads as causal with a conceptual accent. However, the story withholds the actual outcome (“Kael made his decision”) so the closure only reaches a charged poise, with the cost and consequences left too abstract. This dampens the sense of a before/after shift that would make the structure feel fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight and legible: one continuous visit framed by prior note arrivals, with each on-page development (stone spiral, first reply, new note, lamp lighting, final rearrangement) causally following the last. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with pattern-building rather than hard reversals, and the closure—Elias leaving the glass and descending while the lamp burns—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. Causality holds; nothing feels teleported or retrofitted. The only limit is modest external pressure, but for this quiet design it’s sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an accumulative, mostly single-scene structure, coherently building from lighthouse routine to emergent vision to charged closing image. Causality is soft but intact: Veyra’s laughter and manipulation of the lantern lead to the city’s appearance and the brief contact. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration—Veyra crystallizes her role as architect of a future city—but the cost of that choice is only abstractly implied. There are no confusing jumps in time or space, yet the arc feels more like a beautifully rendered vignette than a fully pressurized narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: the wing → storyteller’s idea → his winter of observation → traveler’s map → shimmering closure read as a conceptual repricing of what stories and lives are. Orientation is excellent from the opening image, and the floating tea house plus donor-heart backstory are integrated without confusion. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, and the ending provides a clear before/after in his understanding, with emotional cost tied to the donor heart. The only limit is that the on-page turn is quiet and more reflective than pressured, which keeps it just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the sextant → ascent through thickening atmosphere of memories → balcony revelation and reweighted understanding. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the outset, and the pattern of lyric reflection anchored in present action holds. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and the cost is more conceptual (years of sorrow repurposed) than dramatized loss. The unresolved “pin” sound adds a nice eerie thread but doesn’t quite tighten the causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation and causal flow are very clean: cross into mirror world → greenhouse → keeper’s charge → planting the seed → communal singing → first dawn. Closure lands on-page with a clear before/after as the endless night begins to lift and the realm “seemed to breathe again,” with a modest but legible cost in Elara’s exhausted singing. Structure is linear and appropriate to length, though the path is almost frictionless, with no turn where failure feels like a live possibility. The final image of the keeper watching, knowing the work continues, gives a satisfying resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: invitation → reflection on the past mistake → search in paradox section → discovery of the map → decision to leave. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one temporal window and a clear closure unit (he steps out into the night) that reads as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise. Backstory about the woman is efficiently integrated and clearly tilts the present choice. Stakes remain intimate and somewhat quiet, but there are no real causality gaps or structural confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: absence of the bakery → journey to the tea house → proposition of “absolution” via seeds → planting as closure. Causality holds and the piece adheres to a single, coherent scene with light preamble; the global drive reads as accumulative, with the final act reweighting prior images. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, not a decisive external turn, but the emotional cost (“the weight in his chest felt lighter. Not gone”) is on the page. The main limitation is that the shift from bakery-loss to guerrilla gardening as a response feels conceptually elegant but slightly under-bridged in concrete, situational terms.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: single POV, single location, clear temporal flow from preparation to activation to stabilization of the illusion. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each step with the slide deepens pressure and knowledge rather than creating discrete plot twists. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias consciously chooses to bear the vow and continue fighting the library’s oblivion. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through loss, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Lena waits under the hush, false starts raise vigilance, then the knife confrontation triggers her choice to intervene and restore the fragile truce. Structure is straightforward single-scene, with one meaningful tightening at the drawn blade and a clear resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she hasn’t prevented betrayal, only deferred it, and her understanding of what “capturing” trust breaking means is slightly reweighted. The small convenience of her father’s name instantly altering the knife-man’s stance is noticeable but not enough to break plausibility or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: aurora and tree-election establish the world, the ring activates, Elara descends, meets the man, receives a reframing (“emergent compass,” “terrestrially cosmic”), and the tree migration buttons the scene. Causality is solid under a largely causal lens: each beat logically follows the last and orients clearly. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Elara’s anomaly is reframed as part of a larger pattern—with the trees’ march underscoring a world in motion. The cost of this new knowledge remains implied rather than sharply articulated, which limits impact at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: laughter → discovery of lock → dream revelation → finding the painting → door and portal. The piece delivers solid closure via the decisive act of opening the lock on the door and stepping into the golden light, shifting the story’s world from isolation to release. The main weakness is that stakes and cost remain abstract—“bringing them home” is evocative but somewhat vague—so the ending lands more as concept than felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: postal fragment → discovery of shredded map → reconstruction → revelation of Echo Vault and “last bloom” clue → trip to archives → hidden stair. Closure lands as a Charged Poise threshold image, with Liora poised above the descent into the Echo Vault’s world of lost conversations. However, the cost of proceeding is only faintly implied and the dominant question (“what is the Echo Vault / what truth waits?”) is deferred, making the piece feel like an elegant opening chapter rather than a fully self-contained unit. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the drive lens (causal with situational overtones) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: bluff → village → bluff, with each move causally justified and easy to follow. The accumulative drive (each artifact feeding the sculpture) culminates in a credible Charged Poise ending where the cost is conceptual (a dwindling world of color and voice) rather than plotty. Closure lands via the image of a child remembering, which reweights the prior quiet labor. The lack of a sharper structural turn or on-page consequence for a specific person (e.g., the toy’s owner) slightly limits the sense of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—shifting magnetic north, rising static, then the choice to ignite the box—reads coherent and purposeful. Causality is clean: environmental instability + stored fears → decision to enact a “controlled burn” of self. Closure is on the page with a decisive change (destroying the fears) and a resonant reconfiguration (he no longer defines himself by caretaking). The cost to the dome/farm is sketched rather than deeply dramatized, which keeps this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: locket arrival → mailbox disturbance → neighborhood inquiries → dawn retrieval of the letter, culminating in Clara’s on-page catharsis. The structure is essentially linear with brief backstory shards that are well anchored and easy to follow. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara receives belated confirmation she was remembered and Elara’s ethos of listening is validated. The simplicity veers toward low-stakes comfort; no turn meaningfully threatens or complicates the direction of events.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal spine: discovery of the dice → recognition of their cipher role → Kael’s danced explanation → decoding coordinates → opening the hatch. Closure lands cleanly with Elara stepping into the chamber, a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid where she commits to the experiment despite the sinking lab. Costs (physical danger, moral weight of “her experiment”) are implied more than dramatized but are legible. Structure is tight and single-scene; there are no serious orientation or lens ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: uncanny heaviness at the docks → ominous coffee-ground spiral → decision to visit the chamber → exhuming the journal → revelation about the whale and “echoes” → commitment to go toward the source. The structure (present action interleaved with tightly anchored backstory) is clear and suits the length, and orientation never wavers. Closure lands as a charged poise: Marlowe reinterprets the whale and the nature of memory and chooses to move toward danger in response. Cost is more conceptual and emotional than concretely dramatized, but the before/after reconfiguration is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece is structurally clean: arrive at brook → contemplate prophecy-wound → ritual destruction → departure in altered stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from being ruled by the prophecy to quietly releasing it, and the before/after is legible. Causality is simple but coherent; each step flows from the prior insight or action without teleporting props or logic. The cost—abandoning years of decoding and an identity organized around the prophecy—remains mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: rooftop ritual → object exposed → Mira’s recognition → revelation of the shared legacy → joint decision to “listen.” The story maintains a single coherent scene and POV, with backstory anchored by concrete present cues, and the closure functions as a quiet but legible reconfiguration of options and knowledge. Cost is implied (accepting the “legacy” and abandoning the agreed-upon lie) but not deeply dramatized, which keeps it out of the very top band. Still, structurally it’s tight, with no loose threads or convenience pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line is clean: repeated visits → anomalous resonance → apparition → revelation about the quarantine → choice to join Liora, with no orientation confusion. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration—Elias’s stance toward both memory and Liora shifts and the seashell/resonance motif pays off. However, the late reveal that the quarantine is about containing her discovery feels mostly told rather than dramatized, so the political/external stakes don’t fully integrate into the scene’s pressure. The “quarantine was over” ending leans a bit schematic given how little resistance or consequence is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: lifelong debt and key → sanctuary confrontation → activation of key/thorn → revelation of the emperor’s confession → Lian’s stance shift and exit. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and remains stable, and the scene stays within one coherent window. Closure lands as a decisive change and a conceptual repricing: Lian exposes the buried truth and, more importantly, relinquishes the drive to destroy Vey in favor of freeing herself. The main structural limitation is that consequences for Vey and the wider world are only gestured at, so the cost dimension of the reveal remains more conceptual than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: humming shell → following the vibration → meeting Veyan → uniting the shell → joint song that changes the order of things. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Liora’s understanding of echoes shifts from acoustics to sundered selves, and her role redefines from singer to bridge. The cost is more conceptual than felt (risk and burden of calling the lost back), which keeps this shy of elite-tier structural impact but still solidly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (Mara, shrine in glacier ice, the snow globe), and the causal chain—vision of wreck → dream visitation → investigation via descendants’ dreams → revelation of sabotage → decision to keep silent—is coherent. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative textural overlay from the dream fragments. Closure works as an Earned Stasis: she forecloses the path of public revelation at visible ethical cost, and the snow globe’s final activation seals the arc. Some middle beats (the week of tracking) are compressed into exposition, but they serve the structure without breaking pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulation: solitude → arrival (whistle) → shared tea → gift of the sketch → invitation to stay, with no orientation issues and a legible throughline. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story layers motifs (nets, moon paths, fireflies, sketch) until they crystallize at the end when Ren’s “hidden patterns” cohere into a relationship choice. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: his life’s pattern shifts from solitary contemplation to shared perception, with a mild but real emotional risk attached. The causal scaffolding is intact but low-pressure; nothing in the sequence truly constrains options beyond mood and temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → discovery of letters → reconstruction → realization of the cover-up → encounter with the stranger → guided journey to the stillpoint → diamond’s revelation. The drive lens is primarily causal, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing—reframing the “wasteland” as healing with political implications. However, the stranger’s timely appearance and immediate pivot from presumed threat to ally flattens potential complication, and the investigation resolves a bit too smoothly for the weight of the conspiracy. Costs and consequences remain mostly future-tense, which slightly blunts the structural impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: observatory → radio contact → decision to confront → public challenge to Kael, with no orientation issues. The global drive is causal with a bit of textural build, and closure is a decisive change as Elias seizes the crowd’s attention. However, the climax resolves too smoothly—Kael falters instantly and the crowd wavers with little resistance—so the sense of earned difficulty and cost is muted. The world-changing stakes are mostly declared rather than tested in concrete complications.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: inciting object (music box), experiment with jars, incremental success, then the girl’s arrival that crystallizes meaning. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where his role is re-priced rather than a decisive external change, which works at this length. Causality is coherent—each step follows plausibly from the last—and there are no teleporting props or orientation issues. The main limitation is the relatively soft sense of cost at the end; the before/after is clear, but the price of that new stance is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the ice-song incites, scavenger’s tactic escalates, Elias’s lighthouse gambit reconfigures options, and the hand-in-water choice closes the arc with visible cost. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to track, with no orientation issues and a clear dominant drive (securing the key without being destroyed by it). The lighthouse solution edges toward convenience because its sonic capacities arrive just as needed, but it’s seeded early enough to avoid feeling like a pure late-rule patch. Closure lands solidly: key retrieved, its function reweighted, and Elias’s stance altered.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative, one-scene structure is clear and coherent: the viaduct hums, Elias investigates, a stranger appears, and they commit to facing the coming revolution together. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and that fits the chosen mode. However, the cost of this turn is soft and mostly conceptual; joining the stranger feels frictionless, with few concrete alternatives or risks on the page. The magnetic viaduct’s activation is a good inciting texture but doesn’t narrow options in a strongly dramatized way.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean: escape→exploration→overheard plot→evidence leak→decision to confront, with a clear before/after in his stance toward Voss (Charged Poise closure under a causal lens). Orientation is solid and the single-scene structure is appropriate to the length. The main weakness is how conveniently Voss delivers an expository villain briefing just as Elias arrives, and how easily Elias acquires damning evidence and retreats without consequence, softening the sense of cost. The ending sets up future conflict rather than landing a fully satisfying decisive change within this piece.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the heart → consultation with Kael → confirmation of post-mortem implantation → realization of wrongful execution → decision to seek justice. Backstory is efficiently anchored to concrete present cues (the heart, the shop) and doesn’t muddle orientation. Closure is a clear decisive change—Elias moves from passive guilt to an active plan with Kael—and the cost (accepting he killed an innocent man) is legible. Escalation is more moral/intellectual than event-driven but still coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: one primary scene with brief, anchored backstory, a clear ticking pressure (rising acid / failing workshop), and a causal progression to the bell’s ringing. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world audibly “answers,” reweighting the premise that this is a fool’s errand. Cost is somewhat soft—the workshop’s impending death is declared but not actively worsened or directly traded against his choice in the closing beats. Still, the because/therefore chain (found schematics → built bell → workshop dying → ring anyway → answer) is intact and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the patch and numbers drive the long investigation, which leads to the hidden folder, then the video, then the closing choice. Backstory about three years of digging is efficiently summarized, keeping the scene mostly anchored in a present discovery. Closure is solid: Lena copies the video and consciously “chooses a side,” a decisive change with clear implied cost. The structure is straightforward and perhaps a bit too tidy—every setup pays off—but it remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the seer’s warning → lighthouse mirrors → visions of threat → path through orchard → confrontation → fragment hurled into the beast’s mouth. Structure fits the length with one continuous drive and a legible climax and aftermath, and the closure (beast dissolved, village saved, “reconstituted the light”) reads as a Decisive Change with mild Resonant Reconfiguration. Costs are relatively light and the “reconstitute” notion is conceptually rather than concretely dramatized, which softens the final punch. Still, everything tracks and there are no major orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: orientation to Elias and the marina, movement to the tents, the deathbed scene, then the dock and the decision to stay. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: because he volunteers, he encounters the dying man, which reconfigures his relation to “endings” and leads to his choice to help. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he’s no longer a tourist but a volunteer—with a quiet but legible cost. The drive lens is consistent, though the “waking up changed” premise could more tightly echo at the end to heighten the before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: letter → waiting at the pavilion → his arrival → emotional negotiation → tentative reconnection, all within a single, well-oriented scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her stance toward their “destined mismatch” is reweighted and the relationship’s future is altered. Cost is present but modest—her admission “You hurt me” and choice to re-engage don’t face a strong on-page test beyond his apology. Structure is solid but lacks a sharper turn or complication before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: he arrives with a goal, the prophet appears, the clearing blooms, and the thread revelation redefines his task—an accumulative, scene-contained arc. Causality is coherent and legible: his listening-by-periphery enables the meeting; the meeting enables the conceptual turn. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—consecration becomes “letting wisdom pass through unbroken”—with a gentle but clear before/after. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and low-intensity, which keeps the structural turn from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single, continuous, mostly static scene that accrues significance through repetition of images (photos, vines, light, lavender) rather than causal turns, which is fine for an accumulative/textural design. Orientation is clean and closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the “masterpiece” redefined as process and mutual healing. However, the story offers almost no real obstacles or turns between beginning and end—Elias’s goal is never challenged, and his final realization arrives more as a gentle articulation of the opening premise than as a reconfiguration with discernible cost. This keeps the piece from feeling fully shaped at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive is accumulative/textural: each new use of the crystal deepens understanding rather than moving through sharp external turns. Causality is clean—find crystal → experiment with sound → internalize city’s anomalies → realize the gardens are “remembering”—and the final conceptual shift reads as a clear closure unit (Conceptual Repricing). However, the stakes of this discovery are kept mostly abstract, and “testify” remains a declared future action rather than a structural pivot in the present scene. Orientation is impeccable; no penalties there.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is cleanly circular: he arrives at the garden, enacts a ritual, is confronted with a recording of a prior self enacting the same pattern, and leaves with a reweighted sense of his task. Causality is coherent—fog reveals driftwood, ritual completes, stone message appears, woman yields tape, tape reveals instruction—under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: he steps onto the path with renewed intent, now aware he must “keep coming back…until you remember.” The cost—being trapped in a loop of partial remembering—is implicit but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous image → radical modification of the camera with the clock hand → revelation on the photograph → collapse and escape, with the photograph as the earned prize. The piece offers closure via a clear before/after: the observatory is lost, the impossible image is gained and carried to Earth. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and that lens holds consistently. What keeps it below the highest tier is that the external crisis (the station’s failure) largely parallels rather than truly complicates his core pursuit, so the climax feels somewhat inevitable rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: call → visit → song request → performance → vinyl request and acceptance, all in one contained scene. The inferred lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and the story honors it with a steady build of images and emotional stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he pockets both shards and silently commits to her final instruction, with the cost of loss and memory clearly on the page. Structure is simple but fully adequate for the length, with no orientation issues or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: key → dais mechanism → descent → mirrors → guardian → loop closure → altered noon. Structure is straightforward and easy to follow, with a clear before/after and a Conceptual Repricing of what shadows are. However, the “sealed awakening” and temporal mechanics of the key remain largely conceptual, so the climax reads more as a smooth reveal than a pressured decision with clear downside. Closure lands, but the cost is mostly absent or implied.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the second tooth leads to the ritual, to the map, to the maze’s center, to the encounter and return—a coherent causal chain with a clear before/after. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the drive lens (largely causal with a lyric overlay) holds through closure. The main structural weakness is how smoothly the ritual works and the maze cooperates, minimizing friction or complication and reducing perceived cost. Closure still lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Lena + child emerging with a secret), but with a relatively gentle edge.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a clear goal (retrieve the pearl), a journey into a single setting, acquisition of the object, and a return to the waiting village, with closure through the shared light. Causality is straightforward—she goes to the grotto because of past failure, touches the pearl, gains its power, and uses it. The closure beat (her emerging with a new mode of giving light and a different relationship to her memories) lands coherently with visible emotional cost. However, the central quest lacks concrete complication or reversal; the pearl is found and claimed almost too smoothly, so escalation and cost feel muted.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear: pendant discovery → viral confession fallout → Elias’s long observation → Mira’s theft of the pendant → meeting at the data center → joint relinquishment of the object. The structure is essentially a single present scene braided with efficiently anchored backstory, and the closure (leaving the pendant behind) offers a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. As a Causal/Accumulative hybrid, escalation is modest but coherent and sufficient for this length. The only limitation is the relative safety of the arc—no real risk of rupture ever feels imminent—so the change lands gently rather than with sharp consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure—three cameo figures culminating in his own protagonist—builds cleanly toward a conceptual shift, with no orientation or causality slips. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: each apparition adds weight to the central question of what to do with hope. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines his role from collector/possessor to witness who lets hopes pass through. The cost (accepting incompletion and ongoing uncertainty) is present but underplayed, keeping this just short of top-tier strength.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single, continuous scene with a clear causal chain: tendril → arbor → song → light → decision to involve the villagers. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world is shown to “remember,” and Liora’s role in restoring balance is crystallized. Cost is relatively soft and implied (risk of ridicule, taking on responsibility) rather than dramatized. Still, orientation, temporal logic, and the miracle’s mechanics all hold under an accumulative/lyric drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation, anchored clearly in person, place, and immediate aim within the first paragraph. Reflection on his past work with flash-paper is tightly tied to present action and sets up why this ritual is distinct. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reinterprets safekeeping as an internal, temporal act rather than an external object. Stakes and cost remain small-scale and mostly interior, but the before/after is legible and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: present-tense tinkering framed by concise backstory and world-rules, leading to a single revelatory event and conceptual turn. Causal flow is coherent—working the mechanism prompts the apparition, which reactivates the timer, which recontextualizes Elias’s project. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the device wasn’t broken; his premise was, and the story lands on that realization. The cost of rethinking his life’s project is implied rather than dramatized in action, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each manifested burden is a step deeper into the ritual and risk, and the piece culminates in the burdens dissolving and the silence reconfigured into song. Causality is consistent—the lamp and her orientation in the grotto drive the transformation of air to solid burdens and the associated danger. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, and the before/after (oppressive hush vs. full silence/song) is legible. The only limitation is that the threatened cost (Liora herself calcifying) never comes under concrete pressure, so the climax feels safe rather than edge-of-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: tea ritual → reflection → decision to carve → completed lion → reinterpreted space, all under a single continuous scene. Causality is modest but coherent; each internal realization is prompted by an on-page stimulus (steam, rain, the blank) and leads to the next micro-choice. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—she accepts grief as something to hold and the loft as “enough,” with a clear before/after stance. The only limit is that external stakes remain very low, keeping the arc emotionally focused but structurally quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at the stalled carousel → reflection on regret → lagoon’s stories → confrontation with ghost → reconfiguration into listening. Causality under a textural/situational lens holds: her regret and curiosity bring her there, touch with the lagoon summons the ghost, and the loss of the camera wheel punctuates the turn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from collecting relics of others’ stories to inhabiting the present chorus. The arc is intentionally quiet and a bit low on concrete obstacles, but structurally sound and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: assessment → discovery of sextant → following the redirected water → greenhouse encounter → reframed understanding of the terminal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the ruin into a “beginning,” with the sextant and greenhouse tying the arc together. The cost is more implied than dramatized—no meaningful alternative path is foreclosed on-page—which limits the impact, but structurally the piece is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: the girl’s arrival and the broken box trigger memory, which primes Elias to respond to the uncanny bear and reach the forecourt for closure. Causality broadly holds under a quiet, slightly accumulative lens, and the closure—kneeling on the quartz and letting himself remember—lands clearly with emotional cost. The biggest weakness is reliance on a symbolic coincidence (the bear as unexplained guide) to drive the crucial turn rather than Elias’s own prior decisions. Still, the overall arc from avoidance to reconnection reads coherent and complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene escalates from boarding to discovery to confrontation with the mirror and internal realization. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens: the sundial and his trained listening bring him to the barge, the crate to the mirror, the mirror to the doubled self, and that to conceptual repricing. Closure is solidly on the page—the recognition that he’s been “looking in the wrong places” and the reorientation of the sundial toward himself—with an implied cost in a life spent mis-aimed. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but it’s clear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulating scene as he decodes the rope, discovers the Weeping Shoals reference, and ends in a poised, expectant moment. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and closure is a Charged Poise: he finishes (or nearly finishes) decoding, glimpses something uncanny, and commits to the next investigative step. However, the causality is mostly flat—no real reversal, obstacle, or narrowing of options—and the cost of what he learns remains conceptual rather than felt. It’s well-shaped but too low-pressure and low-cost to hit top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: garden present → capital/king backstory → return to present with the planting of the thread and a resolve to continue her work. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens: the stolen thread and memories intensify the meaning of the present act rather than drive discrete plot turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: planting the thread and imagining its roots crystallizes the story’s question about absence and healing, with a clear emotional cost (ongoing hollowing, self-effacement). The piece is quiet and almost static, but within its chosen mode the before/after stance is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: world’s loss → prince’s vow → mechanical attempts → failures → realization of “flawed genesis” → magical/remembering approach → hatching. The structure is tight for this length, with the repeated attempts and the third-night partial response providing a clear escalation and midpoint tightening. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the birth of the Luminis and Kaelen’s certainty that beauty still exists reconfigure his and the world’s possibilities. Emotional cost is present but relatively understated (years of effort and private breakdown rather than a concrete sacrifice), keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from solitary reflection to encounter to quiet reorientation, with clear anchors in place and no causality breaks. The closure counts as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from coming to prove something for herself to staying to teach another, with the coin and lagoon reframed. However, the sense of cost or foreclosed alternative is soft; there’s no strong “before/after” decision that narrows her future options. The accumulative drive works, but the arc feels more like affirmation than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious box → key/date → breadcrumb trail → meeting the grandmother → unlocking the fountain → descent. The drive reads as a Hybrid of causal and textural, with each move both advancing plot and thickening atmosphere, and the closure beat (opening the staircase and entering) lands as a clear before/after. Cost at the end is more implied than dramatized—the danger or price of liberating memories is gestured at, not tested—so the closure registers as a strong Charged Poise rather than a decisive turn with visible consequence. Structure stays tight within one continuous sequence, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Elias activates the gear to transmit, the nebula responds, Kael arrives to stop him, and the act of sharing light disarms Kael’s ship and reconfigures their relationship. The scene holds together as a single, coherent window with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they transit into the nebula with a new, tentative possibility of breaking the cycle. However, the concrete stakes—what danger Elias is courting, what irreversibly changes in the wider world—remain somewhat abstract, keeping the cost conceptual rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure works as an accumulative, lyric mosaic: workshop → ribbon → greenhouse → spectral visits → butterflies framing time → communal banner. Causality is clear enough (the ribbon draws him to the greenhouse; the mentorship develops there; the poem changes his understanding; he acts publicly with the banner), and the drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: grief is re-framed as shared and bridged, with the public act as a before/after marker. The main limitation is that costs and constraints are mostly conceptual and emotional, never sharply tested in a concrete, difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: pendulum hesitates → Elias investigates the ridge and rake → he returns to the tower and uses the handle to re-inscribe his sins on the bob → the pendulum resumes, signaling restored balance. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the single-POV, two-location structure (ridge → tower) is elegant and legible. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rhythm is restored and Elias’s relation to his guilt is reweighted. The main limitation is that the solution arrives without much on-page doubt or obstruction, so the structural turn feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: find the case → decode tapestry → follow blue, red, then gold threads → recontextualizing realization in the final scene. Causality holds and the investigative path is easy to track, with a clear before/after in his understanding of the dead he tends. Closure takes the form of an internal reconfiguration and a small forward plan (planting roses, listening), which suits the length and mode. The cost and narrative clock are understated, keeping this just shy of top-tier decisiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: stagnant kingdom → need for spark → Elara chosen → uses quill and model → writes an invitational future. Structure is linear, single-scene, and the closure works as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise image—the future reframed as collaboratively modifiable rather than fixed. However, escalation is gentle: the “test of the legend” never faces a concrete obstacle or reversal, so the decisive moment feels more like fulfillment than risked change. The cost of this choice for Elara or the kingdom is only lightly implied, not structurally stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: radio → lyrics → realization about dust → first word → new resolve. Causality is soft but intact, with no orientation issues, and the closure—dust literally speaking “Listen”—functions as a conceptual repricing of the world’s rules and options. The main weakness is the absence of a meaningful on-page price; nothing resists him, and success comes on the first real attempt. Still, the story completes its arc from silence to nascent voice in a legible before/after way.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: single scene with well-anchored flashbacks cued by objects (chair, photograph, journal) and a clear causal sequence leading to a conceptual repricing at the end. The mask functions as the inciting destabilizer, the vision tightens knowledge, and scattering the last ashes plus discarding the mask complete a legible before/after shift. Closure lands: Elias reinterprets his mother’s project, recognizes himself as the portrait’s subject, and chooses to leave the gallery’s psychic gravity. The only drag is a slight over-explanation in sentences like “He understood now,” which flattens some of the earned mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: present-time sewer work → embedded history and theorizing → decision to surface, with clear orientation and a coherent causal drive. Closure lands via a Decisive Change when Elias commits to leaving his isolation to share his findings, which establishes a before/after. However, opposition remains mostly implied; nothing on the page actively resists him, so the turn to action reads more as timing than as a pressured culmination. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a situational flavor, but escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: fractured choir → introduction of the zither → series of rehearsals marking incremental change → culminating harmonious hymn and hopeful closure. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; the repetition of rehearsals and the zither’s presence accrue meaning rather than relying on a single dramatic event. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost implied in the effort of “unlearning” and the fragility of newly found harmony. The only limit is that setbacks and counter-pressures are summarized rather than dramatized in scene, making the journey feel slightly smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean: she seeks the seed, plants it during the alignment, tends the plant, eats the fruit, and is changed. Closure lands via a decisive act (eating the fruit) plus a resonant follow-through (choosing to plant more seeds). However, the alignment-based urgency never meaningfully pressures tactics, and obstacles never seriously threaten failure, so escalation and cost remain modest. Structurally it’s solid but reads more like a polished vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: box → riddle → Maren’s intervention → revelation of sabotage → tower core scene → reactivation of hives. The piece satisfies closure with a concrete Decisive Change (tower discharges, hives revive) and a Charged Poise hinting at larger off-page conflict (“Someone didn’t want us to fix this”). Structure is linear and easy to follow, with no orientation issues, but the solution arrives almost as soon as they reach the core, and sabotage remains abstract and untested, which softens the sense of hard-won resolution. The match/riddle mechanic borders on convenient once they’re at the core, with little resistance or uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean and early: Elias, bay, breathing houses, then a clear present-time mission with the shard and the specific target house. The causal spine—prior experiment → shard’s discovered property → application to this house → unintended pause → realization—is coherent and accumulates well for this length. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: houses listening to themselves and the shard as “permission to stop,” with Elias’ departure fixing a before/after. Stakes and cost are relatively quiet and mostly conceptual, which works, but a slightly sharper sense of what his new knowledge forecloses would deepen the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: diver descends → seeks the secret → statue reframes the bloom as prison → she chooses to use the ampoule → the hidden thing emerges and reconfigures the world and her understanding. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with clear spatial and motivational anchors and pays off its set-ups (ampoule, fissure, tree) in the climax. Closure is solidly a mix of decisive change and conceptual repricing: the “cure” becomes a key, the garden a confession, and the world’s danger is now loose. The one limitation is that consequences remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in specific, immediate stakes for the diver.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arrive → climb → frame theory → roll dice → rupture → reinterpret outcome, all in one coherent scene. Orientation is solid early and the infinite staircase premise is legible without clumsy exposition. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he doesn’t end the staircase but redefines what “rupture” and “missed opportunity” mean. The main limitation is that the structural arc feels modest—no strong complication before the single decisive experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative single-scene structure: smog and insomnia → brush and ritual → the night’s paintings → plan to release them into the city → quiet closure under the moon. Causality holds at a modest scale, with each step feeling like a natural “therefore” from the prior one. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she converts private insomnia into a purposeful, ongoing act of generosity, with the cost (sleepless effort in a poisoned city) implied. The main limitation is that no turn sharply tightens options or stakes; escalation is more of a gentle deepening than a clear hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: bees vanish → elders’ warning → Liora’s dream-triggered return to breadmaking → bees return → tapestry resumes weaving. Structure is straightforward, with a clear before/after and a resonant final image of the tapestry moving. Closure functions as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—history is not lost but shown as dormant, awaiting practice—but the cost of failure is largely not dramatized beyond implication. The resolution borders on convenient (one successful loaf brings bees back) and could use one more beat of resistance or ambiguity to feel fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: yoyo discovery → reverse-engineering → experiments with gravity → activation of the hunger stone → global/time reversal and charged aftermath. The structure holds a single rising line of pressure, with the last drop of the yoyo as the decisive act that reconfigures the world and Elias’s relation to time. Closure is solid—a before/after is unmistakable—and the cost is conceptual (erased names, altered sea/time) rather than viscerally dramatized. A slightly clearer sense of what Elias risks personally would sharpen the stakes within this strong framework.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: resuscitation → cursed Polaroid → return to the funhouse → advisor/dictionary guidance → mirror confrontation → release. The hall-of-mirrors sequence escalates logically from eerie reflections to direct attack to a deliberate counter-move, and the ending offers a clear before/after: Elias exits with his face restored and symbols of fear discarded. Closure has on-page cost (loss of the advisor, relinquishing cloak and photo), though the danger feels more conceptual than materially pressing. Structure holds tightly for this length with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: perception → tentative engagement → full performance → world answering back, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where “he was the one being heard.” Causality is coherent at the level the piece aims for (each sonic act alters sea and sky response), and the single continuous scene holds together. Closure lands emotionally, but the absence of a sharp constraint or visible cost makes the before/after line more conceptual than urgent. Still, for a lyric piece, the pattern is well-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: crack discovery → decision to open it → descent → encounter with the expedition → realization about the watchers → decision to run and seek more cracks. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one transition (surface to tunnel) and closure lands via a clear Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing of what the watchers are doing. The only limitation is that the cost of her new path and the immediate threat in the cavern remain mostly conceptual rather than concretely dramatized; nothing blocks or attacks her as she retreats. Still, the drive lens (primarily causal with situational dread) holds throughout without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: omen (rose) → retrieval → rival’s intervention → ethical negotiation → reconfigured plan. The story delivers a legible closure beat where the terms of the letter’s future—and the meaning of preserving it—change decisively. Cost is present conceptually (accepting ambiguity, partial erosion of the heroic narrative) though it’s felt more in idea than in lived consequence. Structure is tight for a single-scene piece with backstory woven in without derailing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night visit, three progressively deeper notes, and a closing return to shore, all under an accumulative/textural drive. Each found note prompts a new response, deepening rather than reversing the situation, and the inkwell’s gradual emptying provides a subtle causal spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pavilion shifts from a failed salvage project to a living, remembered presence, with Elias’s stance clarified and the inkwell emptied as cost. The only mild weakness is that external stakes (what happens if he fails or stops) stay low and somewhat abstract, making the arc feel more like a beautifully executed vignette than a fully pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the blackout → his targeted search → the ledger discovery → the name in the decree → the revaluation of the stamp and himself. Single-scene structure is clear and well oriented in time/place, and the final realization functions as a Conceptual Repricing with a modest emotional cost. The coincidence of sharing a surname with the magister is accepted without friction, and the world’s history is sketched just enough to support it. Escalation is present but understated, so the structural spine is strong rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival for dreams → methodical theft/shaping → proliferation of lanterns → realization they’re feeding sorrow → shattering and possession. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each section plausibly setting up the next and the priests’ offerings indicating rising external notice. Closure is on-page and legible—the dream escapes and enters her, with the world “transformed”—and the cost is clear even if not yet unpacked. The main limitation is that key escalations (lanterns multiplying, priests noticing, the sorrow’s growth) are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening some structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single, time-bound incursion into the observatory with a clear sequence: infiltration → approach → encounter with the entity → alarms/flight. Causality is generally solid—circuit breakers cooling buys time, geode’s activation draws out the scientist-ghost, the reboot forces her retreat—and orientation (who/where/when) is established early. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she leaves with recharged purpose and new conceptual knowledge (“It’s not just energy—it’s choice”), reframing her hunt at some implied future cost. The main structural weakness is that the encounter with the man-entity feels more like a transient apparition than a turn that materially alters her options in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: chip → drone activation → anomalous star cluster → sound/frequency of belonging → revealed structure → invitation → decision. The piece lands a valid closure as Elias chooses to answer the call, with a legible before/after in his stance toward the signals he’s chased. Cost and constraint are only lightly implied (leaving the observatory, stepping into the unknown), so the climax feels more like an offered possibility than a pressured choice. Structure is linear and coherent, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: noise → suspicion about Liora → driftwood search → symbol discovery → uncle’s confession → key and commitment to investigate. The drive lens is Causal, and the closure is a decisive change in stance, concretized by the watch and the key. Stakes scale from psychological discomfort to an active pursuit of a dangerous family truth. Slightly telegraphed timing of the uncle’s arrival is the only notable convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear anchors of place, time (pre-dawn), and goal (preparing for a prisoner exchange). The inferred lens is Situational/Accumulative: pressure comes from the charged setting, the looming exchange, and Elias’s history rather than plot reversals. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when dawn approaches, they part, and he recommits to carrying/recycling mistakes; the cost is quiet but legible. However, the central external stake (the exchange itself) is deferred off-page, so causality and tension never quite crest.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: academic rejection and inherited expectations drive Elias to the launch, to paddling, to the island, to discarding the compass. The structure is a single continuous scene interwoven with backstory, with no orientation issues and a clear situational drive toward a stance choice rather than external victory. Closure is solid: the decisive act of throwing away the compass and the ensuing internal shift mark a legible before/after with emotional cost. The pressure remains modestly scaled but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: baseball → lake → guide → fork → mirror chamber → realization, with clear causal links. The inferred lens is a Hybrid of causal and situational: the labyrinth is a test whose "rules" are more psychological than mechanical, and closure lands via a conceptual repricing (the maze as mirror). The final beat—"the only way out was to look"—provides a legible before/after stance with conceptual cost, even if consequences lie beyond the page. Stakes are largely internal but coherent and carried through the scene without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival in orchard → preparation of spices → conjuration → demand to let go → transformation and acceptance, with a clear before/after. Closure is solidly on the page: he cannot return as a man, but does return as phoenix, and she chooses to embrace that. However, the path feels almost frictionless; there’s little sense that the ritual might fail or that she could refuse, so escalation is more inevitable glide than pressured branching. Structure is otherwise coherent and well-scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clean single scene with interleaved memory, oriented early and sustained under an accumulative/textural lens. The global drive—performing a ritual to seek lost time and reckon with a buried debt—tightens into a closure where she reconfigures the meaning of the crack and her own endurance (a Resonant Reconfiguration). Causality is subtle but legible: saucer crack → ritual cloth → mother’s lesson → present re-alignment and non-flinching acceptance. The main drawback is that the stakes and turns remain purely inward and sometimes feel like a beautifully rendered plateau rather than a sequence of distinct structural beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual-like sequence in the engine room, each photograph functioning as a beat that accumulates pressure toward opening the locked dimension. Causality is legible under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—Liora answers each sorrow, stitches it, the Tear responds, then she “becomes the wound” and the ship passes through. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the *Euthymia* is sacrificed, the dimension sealed, Liora remains altered. Stakes skew abstract (cosmic sorrow, human ghosts) and might benefit from one more concrete, on-page consequence for Liora, but the arc feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: detour → encounter with the woman → prophecy and vision → tremor → decision to run and warn the village, giving a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: he embraces the role and runs, with the volcano coughing ash as confirmation. However, his supposed power to orchestrate coincidences and the prophetic logic don’t materially shape the climax; he behaves like any decent man warned of an eruption, which softens the sense of unique structural necessity. The eruption and rescue remain off-page, so the story resolves on promise and vision rather than fully tested consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: sundial cipher → anticipation of blackout → observation of aide → retrieval of letter → decision to signal revolt. The piece delivers a coherent closure unit in the quiet image of a world holding its breath as the revolution she’s triggered begins. That said, the stakes and consequences are mostly asserted rather than tested, and no turn seriously threatens her plan on the page. The blackout premise and “cradle of sparks” letter are well integrated but could carry sharper on-page cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: friction vanishes → Elias recognizes unraveling patterns → he deploys star dust and rocks → eels bring the shard → sequence completed → friction restored. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after and a concrete world-rule reasserted. The price and danger around “the world nearly unraveled” are mostly told rather than felt in scene, which softens the impact of what should be a harrowing climax. Structurally it’s elegant and legible, but the stakes don’t fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: observatory vigil → backstory of the timer and protests → arrival of the envelope → focused contemplation of the photo → lightning-triggered recognition → conceptual shift at the end. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, with the storm, timer beeps, and lightning providing temporal markers that keep orientation clear. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing—he moves from wanting to decode scars to accepting the ethical limit of interpretation—with a modest but legible cost (relinquishing his prior, more instrumental gaze). The one area that holds it back from higher scores is that the external situation never meaningfully constrains options, so the before/after is largely contemplative rather than structurally transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene is cleanly structured: challenge → reveal of the needle card → shared decoding → redefinition of the duel into a journey. Causality holds under a mostly causal lens, and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration as the “duel” ends and collaboration begins. The conceptual stakes (turning questions into destinations, hidden overture) land, but the cost of ending the duel-frame remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt. No orientation or lens-clarity penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: key found in prison → carried for years → used to unlock the ruined library → Elias arrives to confirm and join the mission. The interleaving of prison backstory with the present is efficient and keeps orientation clear. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Lumen shifts from perpetual molting to committed rebuilding with the library as locus. The biggest structural softness is the convenience of Elias appearing exactly when Lumen arrives and starts work, which slightly lowers the sense of hard-earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-tense arbor frame, a concise backstory about the wife and clock, and a steady progression to the timed encore at nightfall. Causality is clear under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: his choice to enact the loophole through music summons the storm and reanimates the clock. The closure unit—a decisive change when the clock starts ticking again—is on-page and earned by the build-up of rules (waiting for horizon, surprise encore). Stakes stay focused and the scene never loses orientation despite its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: looming monsoon → Nani’s arrival and confrontation → dream revelation → planting the seed → discovery of the storm-bargain → Liora’s new stance. The structure (present on the ridge + one dream shard) is simple and legible, and the closure—Liora choosing to become a more active guardian of a truer, more dangerous history—is clear. The cost and consequences of her new knowledge are more conceptual than dramatized, which keeps the ending from feeling fully weighty. Still, the piece delivers a coherent Decisive Change with a conceptual repricing of the storm and the island’s history.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: severance → search on the islet → discovery of the compass → activation of the lace → guided memory-path → reconfigured stance at the end. Causality is soft but present, with the magical mechanics (compass + lace) used consistently rather than hand-waving a resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot undo the past but gains a new way to carry it, concretized by weaving the thread into the bonsai. Stakes remain internal, but the before/after of his relationship to regret is legible.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative functions as a static reflective vignette with a "Conceptual Repricing" closure, but lacks a causal chain or active pressure to force this shift. The ending feels like a foregone conclusion established in the opening, with no meaningful tightening of options or risks to test the character's resolve. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the accumulation is low-stakes and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central investigative mechanism—frost patterns naturally replicating smuggling routes on a ledger—strains credulity in a realistic frame. The climax resolves without agency; the antagonist volunteers the secret immediately, dissolving tension without a necessary tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative bridge ("spent weeks") glosses over the causal steps of the discovery, sapping tension from the breakthrough. The climax relies on a sudden, convenient success (striking the glass works where the table didn't) rather than a hard-won turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where magical elements resolve physical constraints (breathing, pressure) without cost. While the ending achieves a resonant mood (RR), the lack of causal obstacles or trade-offs makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and time-lapse ("For weeks," "The next night," "Soon," "One evening"), violating the short-form scope default without establishing a sophisticated mosaic pattern. This "outline mode" prevents the accumulation of immediate scene pressure, though the final closure image of the silent bells is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence—the timely arrival of a dying child—to resolve the protagonist's internal thematic question, which weakens the causal chain. The closure is legible but feels unearned, as the solution (the father) appears ex machina to receive the pre-existing key (the tear).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands effectively with a Resonant Reconfiguration and a visible cost (aging). However, the causal chain relies on a weak knowledge convenience ("forbidden texts") to explain the central threat, bypassing organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on "video game logic"—a musical puzzle hidden in a piano bench to open a survival seed vault strains credibility in a gritty post-apocalyptic setting. The antagonist encounter is resolved too conveniently to earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and cohesive, operating under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens where the pressure builds through sensory density and memory. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing: the "imprint of silence" isn't the scientific breakthrough his grandfather wanted, but it suffices as personal resolution. The ending resonates with the cost of reliving the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure functions mechanically as a single scene, but the closure—missing the train to "make our own track"—lacks causal weight because the destination and the cost of abandoning it are never established. The turn relies on a sudden, mutual whim rather than accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a logical linear path, but the closure—flipping switches to resolve deep artistic stagnation—feels symbolic and unearned. The lack of a visible cost or complication makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot relies on convenience, particularly the caretaker's immediate capitulation upon seeing the shell, which deflates the tension without a struggle. The narrative logic is functional but linear (fetch-quest style), and the closure—a sudden "fresh start"—lacks a visible cost or earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is soft; the climax occurs because the star flickers (external clock), not due to a decisive protagonist choice. The resolution is a "soft reset" epiphany where the booklet conveniently disintegrates, lacking a distinct, earned cost or logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident (violin) and a resonant closure (return to duty). However, the "time loop" mechanic feels like a sudden magical injection to satisfy a prompt requirement rather than a causal outgrowth of the established world. The epiphany resolves the tension a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    The causal link between removing the projector lens and eavesdropping is murky; it’s unclear how one enables the other or why the lens was the catalyst for the confession. The closure ("Let's start over") is a soft reset that resolves the tension without a significant cost or irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from resistance to engagement to acceptance with a legible closure unit (Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis). The "map on the marble" beat borders on convenience, reducing the protagonist's agency in the climax, but the final acceptance of the seedling provides satisfying thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative logic breaks when a literal, physical "lever" appears within a holographic projection; this shift from hard sci-fi to dream-logic lacks groundwork and disrupts causality. While the closure provides a conceptual shift (seeing time sideways), the "reset" (lever vanishes, alarms blare) softens the immediate physical consequences, making the stakes feel low.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, but the resolution relies on a "magic key" solution without forcing a difficult choice or sacrifice; the ending is tidy but lacks a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causality strains significantly when Elias finds the specific burial site by following "the wind's memory." This leaps over the investigation phase with unearned intuition, functioning as a convenient shortcut to the climax. The mystery of the visitor ("peripherally aware") is left as a loose thread that initiates the plot but lacks satisfying integration or resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative relies on the convenient coincidence of finding the exact valve wheel needed immediately before encountering the problem it solves, creating a "lock-and-key" feel that weakens causality. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with thematic weight, the linear fetch-quest logic simplifies the central conflict. Orientation and pacing are otherwise solid.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situational/Accumulative arc ending in Earned Stasis, where the protagonist rejects the disruption (the book) to restore order. While the closure is legible, the inciting incident (finding the book) and resolution (dissolving it) lack strong causal friction or difficulty, feeling somewhat like a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.3)
    The plot relies entirely on coincidence (the girl appearing at the creek) rather than causal progression or active choice. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction" where everything fits perfectly, devoid of the required meaningful tightening or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure coherently builds density toward the final realization, and the Conceptual Repricing (the axis isn't slipping, it's a door) is valid. However, the closure lacks a felt cost; the transition from existential threat to invitation is smooth but misses the requisite sacrifice or "conceptual price" to land with impact.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal line, but the resolution relies on dialogue to untie the knot ("explain-everything ending"), which deflates narrative pressure. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—Elias seeks the secret and gets it without a visible cost or complication to disrupting his life.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds pressure through the layering of sound and ritual, fitting the lens well. Closure lands with a resonant Conceptual Repricing of the possession, successfully recontextualizing the threat into an invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.5)
    The structure is a static frame acting as a container for four associative flashbacks, lacking a causal spine or rising pressure in the present. The closure ("mirror cracking") is a symbolic reflection of an internal realization, but without a paid cost or foreclosure of options, it reads as a low-stakes epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    Structure is coherent, but the climax hinges on a convenient reinterpretation of the prop ("the tablet... had been a warning") that deflates tension. While closure is technically present as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the "soft reset" ending resolves the central conflict without sufficient on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative arc depends on a poetic but physically incoherent climax where a broken needle on a drum creates a stone-shaking vibration; this "magical" resolution breaks the established realist frame. The backstory injection ("Elias had found it years ago") stalls momentum, and the resolution comes too easily, lacking a logical causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    The arc is functional, moving from an inciting incident to a decision, but the causality is soft; the "lateral approach" yields a clue (the mechanical rhythm) somewhat conveniently. The narrative is more reflective than active, lacking a sharp turning point where the protagonist is forced to take a risk before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene is structurally sound and the setting anchors the action well, but the climax relies on a convenient oracle figure to explain the resolution. The closure (keeping the vial as a reminder) works as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of causal friction makes the earning feel light.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where high declared stakes (unraveling time) resolve into a harmless vision with no lasting price paid. The causality is driven by asserted magic rather than a coherent interaction between the character's agency and the world's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation without a decisive causal turn or felt cost; the environmental response feels like a symmetric reward for showing up rather than the result of a high-stakes tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative is a static vignette of a routine transaction rather than a story with a causal turn. The ending asserts a "transformation" that isn't earned by on-page events, and the lack of a meaningful obstacle or reversal leaves the arc flat.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the inciting coincidence is acceptable, the resolution relies on a forced causal leap where Mara requests a complex financial favor from a stranger solely because he delivered a photo. The bridge between the emotional beat (the locket) and the transactional conclusion (the fund) is missing, making the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on the "appear when ready" trope, which acts as a soft-magic bypass for genuine causality; the tag appears simply because the plot requires it, not because Liora changes her tactics. While the closure (finding a root) is legible, the mechanism driving it is convenient, lacking a "because/therefore" chain that forces the protagonist to confront a true obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.5)
    The ending ("dissolved into light") acts as a soft reset rather than a closure unit with legible cost or state change. The narrative builds a linear path to the hourglass but evaporates at the decisive moment, failing the strict closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual-to-success arc with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The closure is a thematic summary ("Elias understood then") rather than a dramatic event, resolving the tension through explanation instead of action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The scene possesses a clear arc and closure (Earned Stasis), but the inciting urgency is weak. Since Elias found the tape weeks ago, the specific necessity of moving it "tonight" during an outage—rather than any other quiet night—feels manufactured to force the scene, creating a minor causal wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident (the leaf) and a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure. The causality follows a magical logic that holds together, though the "invitation" aspect feels slightly convenient; the narrative successfully moves from observation to a decisive internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causality relies on dream logic (the brooch manifesting in the pocket) and coincidence (the woman waiting in the cave). The climax dissolves into expository dialogue ("It was all an exchange") that explains the plot rather than dramatizing the closure through action.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative functions effectively as a fable with a clear decisive change (Conceptual Repricing of magic), but the "three days later" transition reads like summary and dilutes the tension of the initial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear acquisition chain ("fetch quest") where obstacles are bypassed through convenience (Dain has the second valve; the guard is a friend) rather than struggle. While the final conceptual repricing (erasure vs. exile) provides closure, the lack of resistance and on-page cost during the rising action weakens the structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Decisive Change/Departure) is structurally sound. However, the progression lacks causal friction; the protagonist follows a breadcrumb trail without encountering meaningful obstacles or disorientation, making the resolution feel like a prologue rather than a complete story unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where the inciting incident (whale songs) and climax (touching the tile) occur without causal friction or obstacle. The resolution relies on a "magic feather" mechanism where the object resolves the conflict for the protagonist, resulting in a convenient change of heart rather than a hard-won realization.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the climax relies on a vague magical interaction ("channeling her dimensional awareness") that resolves the conflict too conveniently. The closure arrives at a philosophical realization ("silence"), but the causal link between the confrontation and this specific insight feels tenuous and unearned by the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive closure moment where Elias abandons neutrality. However, the climactic dialogue ("Prove it" / "With what?" / "By waiting actively") suffers from a logical syntax error—the response answers "how" rather than "with what," creating a stumble at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot relies on a magical coincidence (the ghost entry) to resolve a static situation, lacking a causal chain derived from the protagonist's specific actions. Closure is a "soft reset" where the character feels peace simply because the story ends, with no visible cost or irreversible change in the status quo. The mechanism of "refracting time" is asserted but never operates as a logical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure effectively utilizes a Situational lens, moving from the inciting bureaucrat error to a resonant closure without forcing artificial plot turns. The return of the name &quot;Daniel Mercer&quot; creates a solid loop, though the middle section relies on a montage-like compression rather than a dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience, most notably a cello remaining intact and playable inside a ruin exposed to "salt-laced wind," which breaks causal plausibility. The plot progression is driven by visions that explicitly explain the mechanics ("It points to moments") rather than protagonist agency or deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on extensive summary to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, skipping the actual struggle. The closure is a "Thematic Echo" failure: the conflict (investors/vote) is resolved by a platitude ("we choose it") rather than a causal action or a paid cost. The ending ignores the established threat, offering assumed resolve without earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure lands, but the scene involving chemical reactions is a structural detour that contributes nothing to the causal chain. The ending relies on an internal realization that feels slightly disconnected from the immediate action of the photograph.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality suffers from a significant logic gap: the protagonist, established as blind, explicitly examines "the way ripples bent the glow" to gain information, which is physically impossible. The resolution mechanism—matching drone feedback to an anchor chain to "send it home"—reads as vague technobabble rather than a logical deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a fragile intuitive leap—condensation as a map of time—that lacks sufficient causal grounding or foreshadowing to feel earned. While the ending offers a decisive change in location, the path there feels structurally disjointed, bridging the gap between "ruins" and "convergence" with assertion rather than logic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure that coheres under the lens, but the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned. The closure—a restored "listening" state—lacks a legible on-page cost or sacrifice, resulting in a low-stakes fix rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear inciting incident and rising action leading to a legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The "dream logic" of the solution fits the genre, but the climax relies on a convenient exposition dump from the dead diver to explain the rules, which weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear, and the closure—light restoring, Elias fleeing—is decisive. The resolution relies on a somewhat convenient magical reaction (the lattice shattering upon his speaking), which softens the causal rigor of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" device where the bead instantly cures convenient amnesia to resolve the plot. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the debt) is legible, the causal path to get there is mechanical and lacks protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where tools (needle, loom) appear conveniently to resolve the path, bypassing causal friction. While the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure lands an image, it lacks a legible cost or hard choice, feeling more inevitable than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line from arrival to restoration, and the closure (Restoration) is legible and complete. The structure relies on a "lock-and-key" progression where success feels inevitable once the location is found, lacking a moment of genuine jeopardy or a decisive turn that complicates the outcome beyond physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative suffers from a significant causal flaw: Elias is already at the secret meeting spot ("Today, he was here for himself") *before* he solves the puzzle that tells him to go there. This coincidence removes the agency of the solve; the clue merely confirms his current location rather than driving movement or choice. The protagonist stumbles into the solution by habit rather than deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary to resolve its central conflict ("By nightfall, the message had spread"), bypassing the necessary dramatization of the struggle. The core premise—that conspirators physically moved stars to hide a date—creates a massive scale imbalance that is never addressed; if they have god-like power, a whisper campaign shouldn't topple them so easily. The ending lacks a dramatized closure unit, relying on a montage of success.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, with a clear inciting move (entering the labyrinth) and a defined closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). The causality holds under a Situational lens, where the location forces the internal shift. The ending—leaving the letter unsent while achieving internal peace—provides a satisfying, non-binary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on a "magic fix" resolution that breaks the gritty realism established in the opening; the coral functioning as a literal glowing decoder ring is unearned. The causality dissolves into convenience, bypassing the need for genuine communication or struggle to achieve the "Home" realization. The ending is a deus ex machina that resolves the trauma without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the camera inexplicably alters reality (changing the hand from reaching to holding) without established rules or cost. This breaks causality; the "knowledge network" explanation is a thin veil for a Deus Ex Machina that resolves the central tension instantly. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without the requisite conceptual or emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear, escalating causal chain structured around the "awakenings," which provides a strong spine for the surreal events. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the mural from artwork to portal—is earned by the accumulation of pressure, though the final transition from physical danger to metaphysical invitation moves quite rapidly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story abandons the scene's immediacy for a summary ending ("The first message was planted... By the time tax collectors noticed..."). This montage dissolves the tension of the specific moment to explain the campaign's success, violating the requirement for on-page closure with felt cost within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building sensory pressure to a release point. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the postcard changing from singed to soft), which works lyrically. However, the causality is soft; the transition from writer's block to flow is instantaneous and magical ("the shell seemed to lean in"), lacking a visible, paid cost on the page beyond "tears."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on a serendipitous observation (light casting a shadow like a mouth) after thirty-seven years of stasis, creating a significant causality gap. The solution feels arbitrary rather than earned by pressure or accumulated skill, resulting in a convenient "soft reset" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and creates a clear change of state, but the resolution relies on a "magical voice" deus ex machina that validates the protagonist too easily. The causality is functional, but the transition from deciphering to "archive erupting in light" feels unearned by the preceding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on coincidence; finding the surveyor's chain and the explanatory letter exactly when needed resolves the tension without causal effort. The ending is an "explain-everything" moment that dissolves the problem rather than confronting it.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.3)
    The scene is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident (Lena’s entry) and a legible closure choice. However, the plot relies on the convenient coincidence of Lena finding the specific lyric sheet and the previous owner's note, which simplifies the investigative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from investigation to a surreal encounter and finally to resignation (Earned Stasis). The causality holds under an Accumulative lens, though the "butterfly effect" explanation for the missing storm feels like a convenient patch rather than a deep structural element. Closure is legible, but the orientation is slightly destabilized by the abstract nature of the "splintered world" context.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (find key → unlock door) with no meaningful reversals, complications, or deepening of the mystery. The ending is a soft reset where Elias leaves with no visible cost or consequence, failing the closure requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is weak; Liora follows seeds based on a hunch she &quot;couldn’t say why,&quot; relying on narrative convenience rather than logical progression. The closure arrives via a simple change of mind without external pressure or a decisive change in options, dissolving the conflict rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scene is coherent and the "Accumulative" lens holds, but the progression feels frictionless; the resolution (the duet) arrives without a "Decisive Change" that costs the protagonist anything significant. The closure is legible but relies on a "magical realism" logic that feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear inciting incident and closure, but the mechanics of the climax (creating ink from "crushed pearl" and "dust") lack causal setup in the scene. The timeline feels compressed, resolving a life-altering risk with a single moment of agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a convenient wise-mentor figure to explain the plot and direct the protagonist's actions, bypassing causal struggle. The inciting incident (the dream) leads linearly to the resolution without complication or escalation. Closure is weak because the "truth" is handed to Elias rather than earned through a decisive change or sacrifice; the ending provides an answer without a corresponding price.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is linear and coherent but relies on the convenient arrival of the stranger immediately after the object is found. The resolution—writing in a notebook—is a soft landing that feels more therapeutic than dramatic, lacking a decisive turn or costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story ends on a "Chapter 1" promise ("the work had only just begun") rather than satisfying the closure requirement with a paid cost. The resolution (the gauge activating) feels disconnected from the protagonist's specific agency, relying on magical coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "tour" structure lacking causal complications or reversals; the climax relies on static exposition from an NPC ("The last cartographer") rather than active discovery, resulting in a low-cost, "chosen one" style acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The scene orientation is clear, and the narrative arc follows a legible accumulative path to the bells' ringing. However, the closure relies on a soft internal assertion ("She believed in it") without a dramatized cost, external validation, or a difficult choice to earn that shift in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scene is oriented well and follows a clear linear path, but the narrative arc is flat due to the lack of obstacles. Closure lands as a "soft reset" agreement facilitated by a prop (the coin) rather than a decisive change earned through struggle or tactical pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution relies on a severe "Easy Button" anti-pattern: a massive ecological engineering project is undone with "a few taps on his phone." This mechanical triviality robs the climax of weight and cost; the physical difficulty of the drought is erased instantly by technology, making the ending feel unearned and the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot is strictly linear with weak causality; magical barriers open because the character remembers things, not because of tactical ingenuity or sacrifice. The closure—a realization about voice—feels unearned because the inciting challenge offered no meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a static vignette rather than a causal story; Liora arrives, performs a ritual without obstruction, and leaves satisfied. The ending ("The work was just beginning") is a "looking forward" conclusion that lacks the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The shadows moving suggests a shift, but it has no consequence for the protagonist or the world on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with intended thematic weight, but the linear progression lacks causal density—events happen to the protagonist rather than being forced by her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a pivotal turn or complication; it follows a "task completion" structure where the protagonist arrives, succeeds without resistance, and leaves. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, it lacks a visible on-page cost or risk of failure to give the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from the bunker to the forest and a revelation. However, causality is soft; the transition from dream to reality relies on dream logic, and the resolution (wax transforming into a key by touch) is a convenient magical fix without setup. Closure is present but feels unearned due to this low-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story achieves a high-quality Conceptual Repricing closure; the protagonist revalues the tile from a tool of binding to one of preservation, accepting the "covenant with the future" at the cost of his own safety. The narrative arc is tight and causal, with the arrival of the mercenaries providing coherent pressure that forces the realization without acting as a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality is softened by magical convenience; the broken pin fixes itself in the opening beats, removing a tangible constraint and cost. The climax relies on a "he was actually kind" twist that dissolves the central conflict by invalidating the grievance, resulting in a low-stakes closure that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.5)
    Closure lacks the required visible or felt cost; the sextant is restored ("whole once more") and the dream is caught, resulting in a net-gain ending that feels unearned. The narrative relies on dream logic where obstacles dissolve via realization rather than causal action, softening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear emotional shift. However, the movement is linear and low-resistance; the "breach of contract" backdrop provides flavor but fails to exert causal pressure on the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc relies on a convenient "eureka" moment to resolve the central mystery without sufficient prior complication or failed attempts. While the closure creates a conceptual shift (cataloger to pursuer), the lack of on-page obstacles makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative summarizes the central struggle (navigating the maze), dissolving tension exactly where it should escalate. The resolution relies on a convenient coincidence—the library presenting the sister immediately—undercutting causality and the established difficulty of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is linear and coherent, effectively utilizing an accumulative design as Elias moves deeper into the ship. However, the closure—dissolving into fog—feels like a soft exit that evades the visceral cost of the "choice," and the transition "Through narrative threads" disrupts immersion by reading as a meta-commentary rather than a diegetic mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and relies on convenience; the magical rope functions exactly as needed without trial or error. The threatening voice ("You were never supposed to find this") introduces an antagonist that immediately vanishes, creating a false suspense beat that is never resolved (a "loose thread"). Closure is present but weak; the decision to "archive the truth" feels like a low-stakes default rather than a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (sanctuary becomes artifact). However, the climax relies on "binding words" introduced exactly at the moment of need—a convenient new ability that resolves the central problem without prior setup, weakening causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative moves in a straight line with little resistance; the protagonist forms a plan and succeeds immediately without complication. The causal mechanic between the prism and the distant tower is vague, and the "retrocognition" setup undermines the clarity of the resolution—it is unclear if he is seeing a past light or a present signal.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure (three monuments) builds effective pressure. The shift to the fog bridge creates a legible Conceptual Repricing closure with clear intent and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, though the backstory injection ("three towns back") is a convenient catalyst. The cause-and-effect of the ritual is linear and somewhat predictable, lacking a moment of doubt or failure that would heighten the resolution's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, framing a moment of transition effectively. However, the climax relies on a convenient magical disappearance ("The cicada, too, had vanished") to force the beat, which softens the causality. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the "silence," but the mechanism is slightly deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story holds a consistent situational lens, using the gravity inversion as a pressure cooker that forces the encounter. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: Liora keeps the doll, but its meaning shifts from a talisman of protection to a burden she is strong enough to carry. The "next time" ending earns its stasis by validating her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    A significant orientation contradiction undermines the opening: the first sentence describes "fracturing sunlight," while the third establishes it is "Tonight." The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the linear structure lacks sufficient causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear video-game logic where obstacles are overcome instantly by convenient memories ("She recalled the warnings") rather than struggle. Closure lands with a status change, but the "cost" is abstract and atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc, but the closure relies on a convenient mirroring (the exact same scar) that resolves the conflict instantly. The "fading threshold" logic is asserted rather than dramatized, and the ending lacks a felt cost; the transition from isolation to connection is too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc creates a satisfying emotional closure where Elias reclaims his agency, but the sci-fi logic underpinning the climax is murky. It is unclear why a "successful" version of Elias would offer to trade places with a "broken" one, or who exactly sent the messages if they weren't for him, creating a causality gap that relies too heavily on "quantum magic" convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.9)
    The pivot relies on a causal break: "Then, the muse struck" functions as a deus ex machina to solve the problem without prior setup or deduction. The mechanics of the resolution—a physical crank handle operating on a wooden plank to generate audio-visual history—lack established logic, making the closure feel arbitrary rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    The scene is structurally sound with a legible Decisive Change at the closure (trading sword for strings). However, the causality is soft, relying on a "mysterious stranger" to explain the stakes and offer the choice, rather than events forcing the protagonist's hand through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is weak; the timeline (Daniel aging out in 1945 vs. a living landlady with a recent postcard) strains plausibility without explanation. The resolution relies on the convenient coincidence of the landlady possessing the exact answer. Closure is soft and sentimental, lacking a decisive change or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, moving from the lagoon to the broadcast. However, the climax relies on a convenient de-escalation ("enforcers hesitated") that weakens the causal stakes of the broadcast. The blend of magical realism (puddle maps) with hard-tech servers creates a slight world-logic friction that isn't fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no complications or causal reversals; the ritual simply works as intended. Spatial geometry is disorienting—Elias approaches the "prism atrium" but then occupies a "grotto not on any map" while still being lit by the atrium's light, blurring the physical reality of the scene without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies on a "dream ex machina" (waking up with the knowledge) to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and the climax, breaking causal tension. The closure—becoming part of folklore—is a soft fade-out that lacks a decisive, dramatized beat of change or consequence on the page; the "transformation" is stated in exposition rather than earned through a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that dissolves causality; the protagonist follows a magical object to a portal that resolves his problem for him (the "Gift" ending). The transition to the city bypasses the central conflict of the broken clock, resolving it by changing world rules rather than through character agency. Closure is achieved without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear inciting incident and a functional discovery sequence that leads to closure. The "Forgive" revelation is a bit convenient, but the causal chain holds; the orientation is efficient and grounds the stakes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot is linear and lacks a causal turning point or necessary obstacle; the protagonist simply arrives and receives a gift. The resolution relies on a "vending machine" dynamic where the goal is achieved without visible cost or complication, resulting in weak closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on a "magic potion" beat where a stranger appears and hands the protagonist the resolution in a vial. This externalizes the epiphany and lowers the narrative tension significantly. The realization is immediate and unearned by struggle, functioning as a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure effectively supports an accumulative arc, leading to a clean Conceptual Repricing where the fragment shifts from echo to anchor. The pacing is steady and the closure lands with a sense of conceptual weight, though the causal links between scenes are loose and dreamlike rather than driven by urgent necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a "utility belt" convenience—Mira happens to have the specific magical tool needed (found "last week") to fix the problem immediately. This bypasses the need for improvisation or struggle, reducing the plot to a procedural checklist rather than a dramatic arc with genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from the inciting whisper to the library's dissolution. The causal chain is symbolic/mythic rather than mechanical, which fits the genre. The closure (a decisive change to a single tree) is legible and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—reconfiguring the archive through the mirrors—lands with a legible effect. However, the resolution relies on a "magical" ritual that functions conveniently without a precise causal mechanism or severe complication. The cost is physical exhaustion ("breath shallow"), which is functional but lacks deep narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.4)
    The resolution relies on a "magic button" ending (slotting the chip) that instantly fixes global stakes without logical causality or cost. The connection between internal truth and external repair is asserted rather than proven.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies on the sudden, unestablished utility of "psychometry" to bridge the inciting incident, which feels like a plot patch. Closure arrives via a realization ("earth decided to remember") that demands no sacrifice, risk, or tangible cost from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative structure is a linear "tour," lacking causal turns or obstacles; the protagonist succeeds immediately at the climax without a try/fail cycle. The resolution relies on dream logic where magic and competence solve the problem instantly, lacking a felt cost for the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    Timeline logic breaks due to contradictory season markers (opening "autumn light" vs. plot-driving "melting winter snow"); the epiphany feels convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.6)
    The central mystery relies on a logic break: Lila waits 50 years with the key to the evidence, a delay that the cipher does not justify. The climax is a Deus Ex Machina where the lagoon autonomously destroys the antagonists, removing protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the narrative arc is coherent, the closure relies on a "magic fix" where the town is instantly revitalized by a mental shift. The resolution lacks the required felt or conceptual cost, offering a symmetric satisfaction that resolves the central problem too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the closure lacks a felt cost; Elias gains enlightenment without paying a visible price or foreclosing an option. The ending functions more as a prologue ("just getting started") than a resonant literary close, resolving the central mystery (the silence) with a convenient supernatural response rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to a magical event and back to a changed perspective (Conceptual Repricing). However, causality is soft; the "vortex inheritance" functions as a convenient tool that works immediately upon contact, lacking mechanical friction or an "all is lost" moment to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is functional, with a clear inciting switch and climax, but the turning point relies on the storm "changing its mind," which reads as a deus ex machina that invalidates the protagonist's skill without a causal cue. The closure lands, but the mechanism forcing the error is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where a coincidence (magic star) triggers a soft epiphany without significant causal friction or cost. While orientation and structure are competent, the closure feels unearned because the protagonist faces no resistance; the "change" is asserted by the narrator rather than proven by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situation/Response arc with a clear inciting incident (ghosts changing) and climax (opening the box). However, the resolution relies on a "magic key" logic where reading a thematic note instantly dispels the conflict, resolving the tension a bit too tidily without a lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality is weak, relying on intuition ("he was sure of it") to connect the urn to the garage sales rather than logical discovery. The climax hinges on a dream sequence that explains the plot's rules, resolving the central mystery through convenience rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where nature resolves the conflict without logical causality or price. A significant prop continuity error occurs: Mira kneels in sand with no established writing tools, yet the ending references a "page," "quill," and "fingers stained with ink," breaking literal plausibility for the sake of metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative suffers from a severe causality break: Elias wires trees for growth that requires years, despite acknowledging they will be bulldozed in a week. The closure relies on a sentimental assertion that "the trees would remember," ignoring the physical reality of the established threat (paving), which renders the climax functionally meaningless.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on dialogue exposition ("ancient order of chemists") to bridge the gap between setup and resolution rather than dramatized discovery. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing, but it arrives via explanation rather than a causal chain of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story operates as a linear vignette with an Accumulative drive, successfully completing the ritual of the seeds. However, the closure relies on summarized emotion ("his heart was not [lighter]") rather than a dramatized cost or a decisive shift in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.0)
    The causal link between the riddle ("Echo") and the hiding spot ("rusted oil drum") is missing, leaving a logic gap in how he found the cylinder. Using a riddle-based scavenger hunt for a desperate SOS from the "other side of a grave" strains plausibility and feels like a game mechanic rather than a character-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is functional but relies on a coincidence (the sudden appearance of the anomaly) to resolve the protagonist's stasis, rather than a complication generated by his choices. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, the inciting flicker arrives conveniently to solve the problem of his isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative builds a clear trade mechanic (secret for secret) but abandons causal logic at the climax; the Guardian rejects the trade yet hands over the prize anyway. This "soft reset" resolves the plot without earned effort or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path but lacks strong causality; the central turn ("Teach me") is a low-stakes agreement rather than a forced choice, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on soft causality where tools (the feather) function as universal keys without mechanical setup, resolving conflicts through atmospheric convenience rather than earned logic. The structure is linear and accumulates pressure, but the descent feels like a sequence of inevitable events rather than a plot driven by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the tapestry decoding to the memory confrontation, ending with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The middle section relies on summarized "decoding" rather than dramatized struggle, and the tapestry functions as a convenient device, but the closure lands with a distinct felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path: prompt, action, result. The causality is functional—Echo’s instructions lead directly to Lira’s success—but lacks complexity or unexpected deepening. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the ritual, but the ease with which Lira masters the "refraction" magic lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot hinges on a "situational" coincidence (scars perfectly matching a random statue) that strains credibility and resolves the central conflict without agency. Closure is a "fix-it" moment where the magic restores everything (workshop, memories) without a visible cost or trade-off, failing the requirement for a decisive change with price.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a quest for an object to a resonant conceptual repricing of loss. The pivot point—the shell sinking—effectively forces the protagonist into a new physical and emotional space. While the "wrong turn" is a slightly convenient trope to bridge scenes, the closure is earned and meaningful, offering a distinct "after" state.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is complete with clear closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the protagonist proves his theory. The fable-like logic holds, though the mechanics of the "garden scent" and "vibrations" remain slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (wait, receive orders, depart) that lacks a decisive turn or structural closure. The ending functions as a "next level unlocked" promise rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist merely moves to a new coordinate without reweighting the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal arc is solid, moving efficiently from discovery to rejection. Closure is decisive and valid, with the physical act of burying the eye representing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of her stance, though the textbook discovery feels like a convenient bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a weak causal chain; the "investigation" resolves immediately via a magical transfer of information rather than active deduction or struggle. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply accepts the burden without a dramatized cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience: the chip coincidentally matches the door, the ants lead him directly to it, and the "Doorway of decisions" lore appears in thought exactly when needed to explain the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear structure with clear orientation and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the progression is frictionless; the climb and entry into the grotto happen without causal complications or setbacks that would heighten the sense of achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative acts as a prologue rather than a complete story; the ending ("Now we decide what to do with it") defers the actual consequence and decisive action beyond the page. While the reunion functions as a beat, it lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with a paid, felt cost in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative builds tension but fails to provide the required on-page closure, ending on a "cut to black" cliffhanger ("The door swung open") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The external arrival interrupts the internal arc rather than resolving or recontextualizing it with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft" encounter structure where a request is made and immediately granted without complication. The pivotal moment hinges on the name coincidence, which creates a false sense of depth rather than causal necessity. Closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" (the screw becomes a story), but it lacks the required "felt cost" to reach higher bands; the resolution is purely additive and sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible "before/after" state via the crystallized rune. However, the resolution relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem (ink hardening) becomes the solution without a distinct sacrifice or complication, making the closure feel tidy rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax (the bottle breaking, the voice manifesting). The cost—the destruction of Clara's physical token—is a solid, felt price for the closure. The causal linkage between the induction ritual and the result is maintained, though the pacing feels linear with minimal complications.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path with no causal resistance; the climax relies on a "magic feather" mechanism where the stone, initially dark, flares to life simply because she waits a moment, not because of a tactical shift or paid price. This breaks causality (effect without sufficient cause) and resolves the cosmic stakes with unearned ease. The closure is complete but lacks the "tightening" required for a satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clean Situational arc where the breakdown of reality forces a shift in understanding (Conceptual Repricing) to achieve closure. The logic of the resolution—blood providing the necessary friction/resistance—operates on poetic rather than strict mechanical causality, but it lands effectively within the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.0)
    The structure is static, operating more as a "meeting the mentor" vignette than a complete narrative with causal progression. The closure relies on a symbolic gesture (the laser pulse) that feels unearned because no significant obstacle was confronted or overcome on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure acts as a valid Conceptual Repricing of her father's legacy. However, the climax relies on a mechanical "treasure hunt" trope (heat-activated invisible ink) that feels genre-adjacent and convenient, undercutting the story's literary gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary to establish the relationships, which diffuses the immediate scene pressure, but the accumulative weight effectively earns the quiet resolution. The climax occurs largely through the callers' off-stage decisions, leaving Mara’s closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of her silence—to carry the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear, functional arc to a Decisive Change (dropping the locket), providing legible closure. However, the turning point hinges on a bird's arrival and a sudden realization rather than accumulating causal pressure. The causality is internal and slightly soft, moving from reflection to resolution with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure where the moon rock is paid as a cost. However, the ending dissipates tension by explicitly summarizing the lesson learned ("place where people came to learn..."), treating the reader to an explanation rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a decisive turn or obstacle; the protagonist succeeds by simply proceeding. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains understanding without paying a visible on-page cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from guilt to a "Conceptual Repricing" where Liora reframes her role from custodian to editor. The "erasure" mechanic of the anomaly slightly lowers the feeling of permanent consequence, but the closure lands clearly under the Situational/Conceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative is a vignette with an Accumulative lens but lacks a decisive change or felt cost. The closure—feeling "seen"—is an asserted state rather than an earned shift resulting from pressure or a difficult choice. The pacing is uniform, with no meaningful tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies on video-game logic where a specific object (tapestry fragment) fits a specific slot to resolve the plot, which feels mechanical. While orientation is clear, the causal link between the arsonist's destructive method and the "reveal" is tenuous and relies heavily on expository dialogue to explain the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Causality suffers a significant break during the escape; the "restraints snapped" moment functions as a deus ex machina, bypassing necessary physical obstacles. The transition from lab to garden relies on a "didn't remember moving" fugue state that feels like a shortcut rather than a deliberate structural choice. Closure is achieved through the identity merge, but the lack of opposition weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting discovery (the map) to a resolution (the exchange). The interpretation of the "lock" as a "walk" is a satisfying causal turn that rewards the protagonist's specific skillset. Closure is achieved through a "Charged Poise" moment that reconfigures the relationship between the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scene is coherent and orientated, but the arc is flat; the inciting accusation ("witch") resolves immediately via a convenient prop without forcing a hard choice, creating a low-cost closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured, moving from atmosphere to decision to action with a satisfying "Charged Poise" closure in the lighting of the windows. However, the connection between the "magnets" and the "grotto" remains vague, and the logistics of the "window display" rebellion are revealed via exposition rather than shown in development. The orientation is solid, but the inciting pressure feels somewhat convenient to the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and orientation is clear, but the climax is a low-stakes conversation that resolves the tension without a decisive action or felt cost. The "soft reset" ending feels unearned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, using the evening and morning rituals to frame the deepening of Elias's despair. The closure functions well as Earned Stasis—he recognizes the hollowness of the ritual but chooses it over silence—though the "dream" sequence serves as a somewhat standard bridge between the two shards.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence but lacks strong causal friction; the climax (the thaw) feels like a reaction to the protagonist's presence rather than a result of a hard-won struggle. Closure is present (the ice melts) but lacks a felt price, reading as a "magic fix" rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative fractures into four rapid time-jumps (Day, Night, Dawn, Dusk) within a very short word count, disrupting causal momentum. The closure ("painted the color of awakening") is an abstract label that asserts resolution without a visible, paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.7)
    The climax relies on an unearned external coincidence (the lamp vibrating independently) rather than the protagonist's agency or the established ritual, breaking the causal chain. The closure creates a conceptual shift but feels unearned because the inciting force was accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story relies on a summary montage ("Elias followed the trail...") to bridge the beginning and end, violating the short-story scope default of a continuous scene or distinct shards. This compression drains tension, turning potential obstacles into a list of completed tasks. The resolution hinges on a convenient vision (Deus Ex Machina) rather than a causal consequence of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is strong, moving efficiently from investigation to a high-stakes realization of surveillance. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the protagonist’s tool and intent ("measuring what's left") with a clear sense of entering the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative structure collapses into a "Soft Reset" at the closure; the archive dissolving into light erases the stakes rather than resolving them with causality. Finding the boy immediately upon entry relies on coincidence that resolves rather than complicates the plot. The "purification" goal is abandoned for a transcendent ending that lacks a legible, grounded cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative is coherent, but the climax relies on vague dream logic—merging video to calm a shadow—without a legible causal mechanism or defined stakes. The resolution lacks a felt cost, as the stone rolling away is a gesture of release rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies heavily on backstory (the con, the theft) to supply weight, leaving the present-time scene static and low-pressure. The closure (writing in a notebook) functions as a Conceptual Repricing, but because the cost was paid off-page before the story began, the ending feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on dream logic that weakens causality; the transition from a realistic garden to a magical chamber with fresh coffee lacks groundwork. The climax depends on the unexplained presence of the coffee cup, which acts as a deus ex machina to resolve the search for closure. The shattering hourglasses provide spectacle but lack a clear causal link to Elias’s specific actions or the established rules of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ending relies on a magical convenience (the pen manifesting from the vision) that violates the established rules of psychometry without setup. The closure is a pure victory with no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change that carries a price.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: arrival, epiphany, and immediate resolution without a causal pivot or complication. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," fundamentally acting as a soft reset where the protagonist receives exactly what she wants (unlimited creativity) without paying a felt or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure relies on a "portal" transition that dissipates tension rather than escalating it; the archive sequence functions as an exposition dump rather than a dramatic trial. Closure is a "soft reset"—the protagonist gains a new purpose without paying a visible or felt cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and convenient teleportation rather than causal progression. The "guardian" functions as an exposition device to resolve the plot, and the closure—a transcendence to a new mental plane—lacks a visible or felt cost to earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear transit without significant obstacles; the environment is described as "deceptive" but poses no actual threat to the journey. The closure—a symbolic threshold crossing—lacks a palpable cost or decisive turn, as Mira's internal shift is asserted ("didn't feel like a passenger") rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain relies on "video game logic" where a missing bolt creates a visible rust trail up a staircase, which strains credibility. The confrontation lacks friction; Veyra immediately explains the central mystery without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative reads as a prologue or setup scene rather than a story with closure; the ending is a "locked and loaded" moment (Charged Poise) that lacks a legible on-page cost. The causal chain is linear (search -> find -> take) with no meaningful reversal or price paid for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal chain is logical and the mystery resolves with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (isolation to connection). However, the progression from missing data to finding the hidden pages feels linear and slightly convenient, lacking significant obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path under a Causal lens: hum draws character, character touches stone, magic returns. However, the closure falls short of the rigorous cost requirement; the "reigniting" happens simply because she shows up, lacking a "Decisive Change" that exacts a visible price or sacrifice. The backstory about the rebellion explains the context but doesn't create immediate obstacles in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on summary for pivotal beats, particularly the climax ("The night she unsealed..."), which distances the reader from the specific action. The timeline shifts from the opening scene to a retrospective tone, weakening the immediate cause-and-effect pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the climax relies on Lena reading a ledger entry that explicitly explains the central mystery ("It knows"), outsourcing the realization to a prop rather than protagonist insight. The "montage" bridge between the inciting incident and the climax weakens the causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "waking up" resolution acts as a soft reset, negating the physical stakes of the crushing room without exacting a legible cost. The transition from the "coffin" back to the vast library relies on dream logic that undercuts the narrative tension and renders the climax consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on an unearned epiphany ("long enough... to see the truth: it wasn’t just ink") that breaks causality; the protagonist knows the nature of the magic without evidence. The ending functions as a sequel hook ("He would find them") rather than a structural closure with a paid cost or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from intent to execution with a clear decisive change at the end (planting the letter). Causality holds, though the vision in the Mirror serves as a convenient bolster to motivation rather than a complication.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails to deliver a closure with genuine cost; the resolution is a "soft reset" where the central threat evaporates upon the presentation of a flower. The causality is weak, as the father's capitulation is not driven by necessary pressure or an unavoidable trade-off. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression (situational lens) that arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causal link between the rail spike and the goddess is purely thematic rather than mechanical. The closure provides order ("constellations settled") but lacks a distinct, paid cost; Kael succeeds without sacrifice or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is logical, moving from the inciting call to the deduction and final intervention. The "proof by contradiction" logic provides a sturdy backbone for the investigation. However, the middle section relies on summarized letter-writing rather than dramatized confrontation, which slightly flattens the pacing before the strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on the convenient discovery of the amber and explanatory letters in the desk leg to drive the plot and explain the machine's function. While the closure provides a clear emotional shift (Resonant Reconfiguration), the mechanism of using the mosquito ink to silence the "haunted firmware" operates on a soft, dream-logic causality that weakens the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent situational path where the environment forces a change in approach. The closure (placing the tile, the glow) is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "glowing object" resolution leans on a familiar trope. The cause-and-effect of the mandala responding to the "unsaid" is effectively established.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene has a legible arc and a definitive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the name is kept but redefined. However, the inciting discovery occurring "days ago" significantly lowers the immediate pressure; the scene reads more as a meditation on a past event than a reaction to a fresh shock.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves legible closure through a "Charged Poise" ending where the timeline fractures, but the mechanism (the tarot coin) feels like a convenient tool rather than an earned turn. The causality is linear and functional, but the "cost" of the fractured timeline remains abstract and conceptual rather than viscerally affecting the protagonist's immediate reality. The narrative orientation is clear, and the transition into the magical realism element is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from investigation to revelation, but the pivotal turn relies on convenient ambiguity regarding the "placebo" pill and a sudden vision. The causality is soft; the mechanism of the vision (was it the paint? the placebo? the geode?) is muddied rather than mysterious. Closure lands with a clear stance shift, but the path there lacks sufficient causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a "fade-to-black" transition ("swallowed her whole" to "When Eira woke") that obscures the actual moment of transformation. This soft reset bypasses the visceral cost of the climax, resolving the tension via ellipsis rather than on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent fable logic where the accumulation of sorted buttons triggers a causal magical shift. Closure lands clearly via a Conceptual Repricing—Mira rejects the miracle of reversed time to manage its flow—though the stakes of this decision remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant causality and logic breaks undermine the narrative. Codes etched in snow persisting for three years (implied by his absence) contradicts basic physics, shattering suspension of disbelief. Additionally, the protagonist teleports from the "cliff’s edge" to the "base of the bluff" to unlock the door without any transition or travel time, disorienting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and follows a clear situational logic: storm pressures the ferry, the rope fails, the protagonist repairs it. Closure is legible as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation is solid, though the stakes of the repair feel somewhat managed rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "convenient ritual" resolution ("just as the stories said it would") introduced only at the climax to solve the problem, which bypasses earned causality. The closure—a magical restoration of honey and glass—arrives as a gift without a visible, felt, or conceptual cost paid by the protagonist. The inciting incident and climax are linked by atmosphere rather than decisive agency.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident (Lila's arrival) leads directly to the resolution. Closure is achieved through the exchange of the relic, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the final line ("key turned in a lock") feels disconnected from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative lacks a decisive causal turn or visible cost; the protagonist is guided by magical convenience (the sundial and arranging library) to a resolution she is already prepared to accept.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the closure relies on a low-cost "mirror moment" where the protagonist simply realizes the answer was within her. The transition from searching to finding lacks a "felt cost" or decisive reconfiguration beyond a gentle change of mind.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from a "magic button" resolution; the subsonic generator resolves the central conflict instantly with no complication or trade-off. Causality is weak, as the connection between "subsonic frequencies" and "cosmic tricksters" is asserted rather than earned. The ending provides closure but lacks the required cost or consequence to make it resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal arc with a Decisive Change at closure. However, the resolution relies on a deus ex machina (the figure handing over the answer) rather than the protagonist solving the puzzle through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on severe logic breaks: a delicate satin ribbon cannot survive six years outdoors in a quarry, and a lance (a large polearm) being "hidden in a cloak" and missed by police is physically implausible. The plot advances entirely through the coincidence of the stranger appearing exactly when Elara finds the ribbon, removing all causal tension. The resolution is handed to the protagonist rather than achieved through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality is undermined by a significant agency break when the furnace door opens "on its own" at the precise moment Mira finds the key, resolving the central obstacle via coincidence rather than protagonist action. This reliance on environmental convenience deflates the tension of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative is a static vignette that functions under an Accumulative lens but fails to land a closure unit with visible cost. The sequence (play fiddle, recall memory, rain starts, leave) lacks causal linkage or mounting pressure. The ending offers a change of location but no "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration"; the protagonist leaves exactly as she arrived, with no price paid for the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The Accumulative structure functions well, linking the startup memories to the physical setting. However, the closure relies on a sudden epiphany ("spirals") triggered by a fox rather than a causal progression or a paid cost, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent track, but the climax hinges on a passive event—closing eyes and receiving a vision—rather than active problem-solving. While the telegram serves as a solid catalyst, the resolution feels soft because the protagonist solves the central puzzle by simply waiting for the clock to strike midnight and the stars to align.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, with a clear causal chain driving from the failed "magic trick" to the final sacrifice. Closure is excellent; the "victory" of lifting the curse creates a new, haunting threat (the child with the knife), offering a resonant Conceptual Repricing of the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, appointment-based structure where events happen because the plot requires them, not because the protagonist overcomes obstacles. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the world dissolves into stars, bypassing the requirement for a decisive change with on-page cost; the "weight" Elias feels is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is efficient and complete, following a clear causal chain from bargaining to sacrifice. Closure is decisive—the trade is made, and the consequence (lighter step, heavier soul) lands effectively. The orientation within the catacombs is immediate and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a massive coincidence—Lena appearing at a remote quarry at night—to resolve the central conflict. This violates the causal drive lens; the resolution comes from external chance rather than the protagonist's agency or a logical progression of events, effectively bypassing the need for him to "wrest" his purpose independently.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with zero friction; the protagonist arrives, thinks briefly, and presses a button (seed) to solve the mystery. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset"—connection is restored without sacrifice or consequence. The lack of causal resistance turns the plot into a procedural checklist rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, building from restlessness to a ritual release. However, the resolution comes easily, and the central tension is resolved by authorial fiat; the "cost" of losing the books is glossed over as a positive, reducing the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the climax relies on a symbolic prop (the crown) rather than strict causality. The mechanism of the "seashell’s spiral pressed into metal" is physically vague—unclear if it is a stamp, an object, or a magical etching—which blurs the logic of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and efficient, moving from observation to action with clear causality. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she abandons the impossible goal (forgiveness) for a harder, necessary one (living with truth). The final beat of walking toward the river cements this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    Causality operates on dream logic where the environment accommodates the protagonist (books slide out, words appear) rather than her choices driving the plot. The closure acts as a "soft reset"—she gains freedom and understanding without paying a visible, irrevocable cost on the page. The "propagation delays" mechanic is stated but functions as convenient magic.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a decisive closure where the protagonist acts to alter destiny, satisfying the drive lens. The resolution relies on a convenient magical mechanic (plants physically trapping the father), and the father's exit ("vanished") lacks spatial concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative structure is a linear loop of "symmetric satisfaction": the goal is stated, the magic tool works perfectly without cost or deviation, and the protagonist feels good about it. There is no causality gap, no moment of doubt, and the "closure" is merely the successful completion of a routine task without a decisive change or reconfigured stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.9)
    Causality is broken by a deus ex machina; the "voice in the pool" simply delivers the resolution, bypassing protagonist agency. The closure relies on an epiphany handed to the character rather than earned through struggle, and the "cost" (dropping a found hairpin) is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent under a situational lens, moving from judgment to understanding. However, the closure relies on a soft reset ("holding space for... uncertainty") without a decisive change or felt cost; the conflict dissolves rather than resolving through pressure. The causal link between the mirror warming and Elias's acceptance is tenuous, relying on the prop to dictate the emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent arc from ritual to realization, effectively using the "delayed revelation" structure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (redefining "vanishing" as "presence"), which is legible, though the lack of a tangible cost or sacrifice weakens the impact. The causality is functional, driven by the magical mechanism rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, convenient path: the protagonist waits, a sign appears, and he succeeds. Causality is weak, relying on the coincidental timing of the bird flock to drive the plot rather than protagonist agency. The closure—a realization of "moving without motion"—feels unearned because there was no visible struggle or cost paid to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence with a legible closure, but the transition into the mist relies on convenient dream logic ("mist walking" appearing as a skill just when needed). The causality feels linear and slightly episodic (command, action, reward) rather than driven by escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality is weak; the link between finding a hotel key tag and deciding to investigate a sunken ship's library relies on "rumors he never believed—until now" without justifying the shift. The climax is a passive observation of a light show explained by dialogue, lacking a decisive change or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative structure is linear but lacks causal tension; the resolution—the universe immediately responding with a "clear note"—undercuts the theme of endurance by solving the problem too easily. The "backwards prophecy" is an interesting concept, but its mechanism is abstract and resolved by internal fiat rather than external testing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedure without complication or cost; Elias performs the magic, and it works perfectly. The ending relies on a "magical text update" on the page, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive change earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: Elias accepts the "raw" imperfect sound over the legendary "pure" note, reweighting the victory from restoration to survival. The causal link between the dripping rates and the mending is sustained by consistent magical-realist logic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.8)
    A catastrophic logic failure undermines the story's reality: paper photographs and corkboards cannot survive decades of submersion in a reservoir to be found intact on tables and pulpits. Additionally, the source of the photo slipped beneath Elias’s door is never resolved, relying on a convenient "ghost in the machine" to advance the plot without establishing a causal agent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Legible closure (shattering crystal) and clear arc, though the progression is linear and the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain is functional and clear: the protagonist makes a harness, climbs, falls, and is saved by the harness. The closure lands as an "earned stasis" (he survives and continues), though the connection between the physical climb and the abstract "revising" of trust is tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is solid with a legible arc from numbness to feeling. However, the pivotal turn relies heavily on the mentor explicitly explaining the theme ("Opposites define each other") rather than the protagonist earning the realization solely through the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure relies on a synopsis-like montage spanning ten days ("Days passed," "On the seventh night"), which violates the short-story scope of a continuous scene or tight shard pair. This approach dilutes immediate pressure and prevents the formation of a cohesive dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on a "magic stranger" trope where a mechanical action creates a profound emotional cure without sufficient causal grounding. The "fuel running low" beat is a false obstacle resolved instantly with a single pull, lacking genuine cost or stakes, leading to a resolution that feels unearned and teleological.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence under an Accumulative lens, leading to a valid internal reconfiguration (Mara stops waiting). However, the causality is soft; the guardian offers no resistance, and the "cost" of the pendant is negligible as it wasn't hers to begin with. The resolution relies on a ritualistic action that feels slightly circular.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from despair to a decisive action that earns its closure. The final beat successfully executes a Conceptual Repricing, revaluing the "broken" shard over the intended gold with a legible cost (the destroyed crozier).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.0)
    Orientation and initial pressure are established, but the climax relies on a deus ex machina (the voice) to trigger the solution. The closure—a transcendence that allows the protagonist to escape the physical consequence of the falling tower—feels like a convenient reset rather than a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a soft magic resolution where a speech fixes a metaphysical crisis without established mechanical causality or cost. The inciting incident (radio warning) works, but the climax (speaking to "echoes") feels unearned and convenient, lacking a decisive change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative progression is linear and coherent, but causality is soft, relying on dream logic where events happen to the protagonist rather than because of his decisions. Closure lands on a conceptual shift but lacks felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a significant logic leap where a rusted anchor chain’s geometry allows for the forging of advanced optical lenses, which strains credibility even within a sci-fi context. The middle section resorts to summary ("Over the following weeks"), bypassing the dramatization of the "fraught" failure and reducing the earned nature of the resolution. Closure lands, but the path to it feels like a montage rather than a causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "contact tracer" premise is established well, but the transition to the climax ("Lena ran") is abrupt. The closure (joining the ghosts) is legible but feels like a standard genre default rather than a specific causal result of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the "return" motivation driving a clean causal chain from the stolen codex to the final phase shift without wandering. Closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration; the choice to remain pays off the setup with clear, irreversible cost and logical consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative structure relies on a "magic oracle" device; the protagonist arrives, waits, and receives a direct verbal explanation of the theme from the ghost. This lacks causal tension or a decisive change driven by agency. The closure is unearned because the insight is dispensed rather than discovered through conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of intent-to-execution without meaningful obstacles or reversals. The "curse" and the "madness" of the predecessor act as false stakes that evaporate upon contact, resulting in a low-friction success ending lacking the required felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to a decisive change (metamorphosis) with legible closure. The inciting logic of the arrowhead found days prior is a bit loose, but the on-page causality of the phone triggering the vision and subsequent choice holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot advances through magical convenience; the locust shell acts as an unexplained key that instantly solves the statue threat, bypassing logical cause and effect. The transition to the mechanical world is jarring, and the resolution—fixing a wasteland by playing a song—feels unearned and disconnected from the specific mechanics of the earlier conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story functions well as a situational vignette, establishing a routine and reaffirming it at the end. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Jace chooses to carry the burden (and the bottled storm) a little longer. Causality is soft; the events follow a routine rather than a tight cause-and-effect chain, but the ending image provides a resonant, valid stop.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the narrative arc is coherent, the story functions on dream logic where obstacles yield immediately to the protagonist's presence. The inciting incident (finding the halo) leads directly to the resolution without complication or resistance. The closure lacks a legible cost; Elias gains everything and sacrifices nothing, resulting in a low-stakes "wish fulfillment" ending that fails the Decisive Change test.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a straight line with no meaningful reversals, ending in a "soft reset" where the world snaps back, effectively erasing the journey's consequences. Closure is ambiguous regarding the woman's status, and the lack of a "try/fail" cycle leaves the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.0)
    Causality fractures when Elias switches from painting with light to photography without a motivated reason why the new method is superior or necessary. The closure ("Not yet") attempts a philosophical stance but feels unearned as there is no on-page cost or obstacle to justify the deferral.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where the central problem is solved by a magical mechanic rather than a difficult choice. The "disorientation" functions as a convenient gateway rather than a structural turn, and the resolution arrives without a decisive change or felt price paid by the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from investigation to confrontation with a decisive, costly closure (loss of the sister, destruction of the site). However, the inciting logic—a celestial map of missing stars aligning perfectly with a small fungal ring's circumference—strains suspension of disbelief regarding scale and projection, reading as a convenient plot device rather than organic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from isolation to a tentative connection that challenges Elara's exile. Closure lands as a "Charged Poise," effectively reweighting her stance toward hope, though the causal link between tea leaf geometry and shadow behavior remains logically opaque even for magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and coherent but lacks a causal engine driven by friction; Maren plants the seed, sings, and succeeds instantly without obstruction. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a tidy, magical fix—rather than a closure earned through sacrifice or ingenuity. The lack of any visible or felt cost triggers the cost-proof deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal linkage between the net hanging in the rafters and the spirits trapped inside the mask across the room relies on dream logic rather than mechanical clarity. However, the escalation from unraveling to "butchery" is decisive, and the closure lands with a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is functional and complete, moving from the inciting tear to the chapel opening with clear causality. The inciting incident (the map tearing at the exact mystery spot) relies on convenient timing, and the closure—while logically sound—feels slightly mechanical in its immediate payoff of the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    A severe credibility breach occurs with the "yellowed papers" surviving seventy years exposed on a submerged desk; in reality, they would have disintegrated, shattering the story's scientific verisimilitude. Additionally, the climax relies on the ghost explicitly explaining the plot ("You’re holding the last transmission") rather than the protagonist earning the realization through action.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a clear resolution, but the pivotal turning point relies on an unearned epiphany: Elias suddenly "understands" the bolt plate is a key without causal logic. This "magic key" solution functions as a soft reset, resolving the conflict through convenience rather than character ingenuity or established world rules. The ending ("Enough") provides closure but feels slightly abrupt given the low resistance prior.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a legible arc from curiosity to renunciation. However, the inciting incident (diary slipping under the door) is an unresolved contrivance, though the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of boundaries—lands with a quiet but clear sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.0)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence—spotting the specific lost airship of his father in a random storm—which strains credibility under the Causal lens. While the closure (jumping) is decisive, it feels like a melodramatic leap rather than an inevitable result of the preceding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, with effective orientation and a legible causality chain. The coin-and-wax mechanic provides a solid, if slightly convenient, progression beat; the closure (leaving the safe) is a clear, decisive action that resolves the scene's immediate goal.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot operates on a convenient "lock-and-key" logic where Clue A (birds) matches Clue B (phrasebook) matches Clue C (board) without friction. The narrative relies on the coincidence of Elias spotting the birds at the exact moment he recalls the book and finds the scratches. Closure is achieved, but it feels like the result of a puzzle falling into place rather than a causal chain driven by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot moves linearly without causal resistance; reliance on convenient prophecy and "instinct" removes the friction necessary for a satisfying arc. The closure functions as an abstract summary of the theme rather than a dramatized change with a felt cost, resulting in a "happy ending" of understanding that feels unearned by the prior lack of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on a summary montage covering several days rather than a dramatized scene, causing the narrative to skim over the conflict; the brevity (well under the 600-800 word target) forces a shallow resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from stasis to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The "pane of hush" mechanics are abstract but consistent within the story's lyric logic; orientation is maintained despite the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is sturdy, linking the nut, blueprint, and rescue efficiently. However, the backstory of finding the blueprint is summarized rather than dramatized, and the coincidence of the nut markings matching the blueprint exactly drives the plot a bit too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.0)
    The structure follows a standard "nature epiphany" arc where observation leads directly to life resolution without complication. The closure—returning to the lab with a new mindset—is a "soft reset" that dissolves the established problems (estrangement, career failure) without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, albeit dream-like, linear progression from stasis to transaction to realization. The closure acts as a valid Conceptual Repricing—shifting the goal from a location to a moment—but the mechanism (the dissolving key, the vanishing woman) relies on unexplained magical logic rather than causal consequence. The pacing is steady, though the stakes of the transaction feel low.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.0)
    The ending relies on a "Soft Reset" where a brief conversation cures centuries of grief without cost or causal earning. The resolution is unmotivated by the preceding action; the protagonist merely states the theme, and the antagonist complies, dissolving the central problem effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.5)
    Causality collapses under "physics amnesia": a small cuckoo clock weight cannot power or repair a massive astronomical tower mechanism. The narrative arc lacks resistance; the transition from neglected tower to town-wide unity happens overnight without a single setback or paid cost. Closure is a textbook "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible inciting incident and closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (shifting from modifier to witness). The causality is functional, though the climax relies on a supernatural intervention (the memory speaking instructions) rather than the protagonist hitting a hard limit of her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension procedural where events happen to the protagonist (symbols shift, pages turn) rather than resulting from her struggle. The "inverted gravity" premise is treated as window dressing rather than a mechanical constraint that forces difficult tactical choices. Closure is a "soft reset"—a simple acquisition of knowledge without a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of steps without a decisive causal turn or reversal; success feels inevitable from the start. While closure is achieved (sound is made), it reads as a low-stakes task completion rather than a resonant reconfiguration with necessary cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the climax relies on external magic (stones glowing) rather than a decisive, costly move by the protagonist. The resolution—where the meaning suddenly "became clear"—is an "explain-everything" ending that feels unearned by the preceding action. The closure is a soft realization rather than a structural reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.6)
    The plot pivots on a coincidence—Liora entering at the exact moment Elias tunes the device—which undercuts the protagonist's agency. The resolution is unearned because the mentor simply hands Elias the solution (the tuning fork) rather than him solving the puzzle through ingenuity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on a "deus ex machina" resolution where the antagonist (Nara) simply hands the protagonist the answer (the grandmother's journal) without earning it through conflict. The ending is a "soft reset" epiphany that resolves the central tension with an intellectual realization rather than a dramatized causal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on the arrow tip as a convenient navigational device (growing warm) rather than character agency. The closure is a "realization" without a visible or felt cost; the protagonist learns a lesson without sacrificing anything, failing the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent "investigate and flee" arc with legible closure (entrapment), but the causal leap from wind patterns to "the city is learning" relies on expositional assertion. The "monster" logic is vague, serving plot needs rather than internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    The resolution breaks the established causal logic: the music requires a "sculpted hush" to be released, yet Eira succeeds by creating a loud, cutting sound that overpowers the noise. The antagonist's sudden stop ("stilled by beauty") is a convenient soft reset that resolves the threat without earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the narrative arc is coherent, the causal chain weakens significantly at the turning point, utilizing a "knowledge dump" from an NPC to resolve the central conflict. The closure is legible but feels unearned because the mechanism of success is granted rather than discovered through the established constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from solitary obsession to intrusion and loss. The inciting incident (finding the fragment) is backstory, but the arrival of the woman serves as a functional on-page catalyst that forces the climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the loss of the fragment and the "unraveling" of self—landing with clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.6)
    Closure acts as a "soft reset" where a mentor figure explicitly explains the plot's meaning, removing the need for protagonist agency or discovery. The resolution lacks a visible or felt cost, as the protagonist simply accepts the insight without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on convenient magical logic where a car window's frost arbitrarily communicates the specific history of the arbor without established causality. The closure ("He understood now") arrives via a simplified epiphany rather than a decisive change in tactics or a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a mid-story travel montage ("The journey was long") that dissipates tension and bypasses the struggle of the quest. While the closure (finding Kael dead) works as a resonant reconfiguration, the bridge to get there feels like a shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot relies heavily on a deus ex machina (the magician's silk) which resolves the central conflict without complication or ingenuity. The narrative is linear and predictable, lacking a decisive turning point where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or where the protagonist must pay a price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal lens from the inciting dream to the final decision. The arrival of the double provides necessary escalation, and the closure works as a Decisive Change where the protagonist commits to a path. The cut-to-black ending is effective, though it relies heavily on the immediately preceding exposition to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    The climax relies on a physical impossibility under the "living" explanation—stones rearranging instantly behind his back suggests the supernatural, directly contradicting the protagonist's conclusion. This causality break confuses the nature of the interaction and the logic of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative is a linear vignette (vision appears, is accepted) rather than a causal arc. Closure lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt price; the ending merely validates the protagonist's existing competence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is heavily front-loaded with a backstory block (~50%) that delays the present scene. The resolution relies on a convenient arrival and a magical map that solves the protagonist's quest without requiring active pursuit, risk, or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where the protagonist's problems (numbness, grief) are solved by a magical object ("moonlight healed him"). This removes the need for a causal price or sacrifice. The ending feels unearned because the solution is gifted rather than achieved through the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: arrival, acquisition, execution, and success. Causality is soft; the solution is handed to the protagonist by the Keeper, and the climax (singing) lacks a "try/fail" cycle or genuine complication. Closure is a Decisive Change, but the cost ("throat was raw") is token and insufficient to earn the realm-altering resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot pivots on a significant causal break: the convenient discovery of a map in *The Art of Vanishing* that resolves the protagonist's obstacle without effort. This "teleporting information" undercuts the struggle. Orientation and closure are clear, but the bridge between intent and action is built on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structural arc is sound, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias plants the seeds. The logic holds well under a Textural lens, though the transition to the tea house relies more on atmospheric drift than strict causality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the causality between the mechanical action (tuning a dial) and the massive outcome (saving the library from falling) is weak. The closure arrives via a "soft reset" where a minor adjustment resolves the central existential threat without a visible, paid cost, failing the 8.0+ closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the climax resolves too easily via a "magic object" (the fob) that instantly de-escalates a lethal situation. The inclusion of "false starts" feels mechanical and list-like, serving the prompt rather than the plot's causality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.9)
    The structure relies on a linear fetch-quest (ring points, she follows, he explains) that ends in a "speechifying" resolution. The closure is an "explain-everything" dialogue dump that creates no causal ripple or decisive change in the protagonist's status.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a *deus ex machina* (the dream) to reveal the hidden door, severing the causal link between the protagonist's skills and the solution. The resolution—opening an unknown lock via "muscle memory"—is an unearned convenience that bypasses the established problem.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks a valid closure unit, ending on a threshold setup (opening a door) without a decisive change, paid cost, or reconfiguration of stakes. The causal chain is weak, dependent on the convenient discovery of a map the protagonist forgot she hid.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure works well: building, failing (melting), gathering new materials, and succeeding. The causality is clear—the ice melts, forcing Elias to descend and find a permanent substitute (the blue liquid). The closure (breaking the orb to freeze the lattice) is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visible cost (destruction of the toy) and conceptual payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain driven by the magnetic pressure, leading to a decisive closure act (the burn). The subversion of the "failsafe" into a tool for personal liberation is a strong structural turn with visible cost (the farm).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on the heavy coincidence of the locket arriving the same day the mailbox is tested. The investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, and the causal link between the locket in the silverware box and the outdoor mailbox is assumed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative moves clearly from entry to discovery, but the causality relies on a convenient ghost-ex-machina (the dance) and a coincidental dice-to-coordinate mechanic. Closure lands with a resonant image, but the lack of active struggle weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is legible, moving from the anomaly to the coffee grounds to the chamber. Closure is strong and decisive, though the link between the grounds and the specific location relies on a genre-accepted coincidence that moves the plot a bit too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-energy trajectory with no meaningful tightening or pivotal turn; the protagonist arrives, acts, and leaves without complication. Closure is technically present (Resonant Reconfiguration), but because the burden of the prophecy is only asserted in backstory, the release feels weightless and the peace unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on the coincidence of both characters bringing identical seals to the roof simultaneously, weakening the causal chain. While the "reveal" structure is legible, the closure ("let's listen") feels like a soft agreement rather than a decisive change earned by overcoming resistance or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story sets up a physical external threat ("Officials," "quarantine," "Great Drowning") but resolves it through a "Soft Reset" where an internal realization magically dissolves the barrier. The ending relies on expository dialogue ("I'm *archived*") to explain the mechanics, bypassing causal struggle or genuine narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality breaks at the climax: a ruthless minister who hunted the protagonist for a decade simply watches her reveal the evidence he suppressed, rather than destroying it or her. Additionally, the mechanics of using a "brittle" rose thorn to torque a metal key mechanism strain physical credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot relies on convenience, with the solution (Veyan) walking out of the shadows at the perfect moment. The narrative is linear and lacks a causal turning point or meaningful obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The middle section relies on a summary montage where deductive leaps happen off-page; fragments like "drowning in a hallway" do not causally prove "sabotage by quartermaster" without more connective tissue. A jarring tense shift in the second section breaks the narrative timeline. The closure works structurally but rests on these unearned logical steps.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a decisive change with visible cost; the ending is a "yes, and" addition of companionship rather than a reconfiguration of stakes. The closure is soft, lacking the "Resonant Reconfiguration" or "Decisive Change" required for higher bands, as the protagonist pays no price for his desire.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative suffers from a severe agency collapse at the climax; the protagonist does not earn the resolution, but is handed the answer by an antagonist who abruptly switches sides. This lack of resistance removes the necessity for a decisive, costly choice. The "truth" is acquired without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story lacks a genuine climax; Kael collapses instantly upon Elias's arrival ("confidence cracking like ice"), removing necessary resistance and tension. The resolution relies on a "win button" mechanism (the portico projection) that grants victory without a visible, felt cost or a test of the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a fable-like logic where the central magic mechanism (trapping sound) succeeds via summary ("on the third night") rather than causal problem-solving. Closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" where he redefines his worth, but it rests on a convenient interaction rather than a forced, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is solid; Elias adapts his tactics (using the lighthouse) in a satisfying way. However, the resolution hinges on a soft-magic alignment of the key with his "soul" that feels less earned than the mechanical solution preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a causal turn; the protagonist waits, and the anticipated event occurs without complication or deviation. The motivation to "unyoke himself" blurs the causal logic of the meeting, making the climax feel like a scheduled appointment rather than a necessitated outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot hinges on a fatal coincidence: the protagonist stumbles upon the villain's secret lair while going for a walk to "escape." The resolution—sending evidence via cell phone from a subway tunnel—is a low-cost "deus ex technology" fix that bypasses the physical danger established in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands clearly with a decisive change from guilt to action. However, causality suffers from the convenient acquisition of the heart and a rapid, exposition-heavy deduction regarding the surgeon's disappearance that feels unearned by the on-page scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the rising acid providing a coherent ticking clock that forces the climax. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration; the world responds to the bell, validating Elias's struggle. Causality is generally strong, though the specific mechanical role of the arrow tip in the final adjustment is slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary to bypass the actual investigation ("The deeper she dug... Then, one night, she found it"), effectively skipping the causal chain of discovery. The climax hinges on a "villain/victim monologue" video dump that explains the plot rather than revealing it through active struggle. The causality is "and then" rather than "therefore."

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path but collapses at closure into a *deus ex machina*; throwing the crystal resolves the threat via unexplained magic without cost. The inciting incident and climax feel mechanically staged to satisfy prompts rather than causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving causally from the assignment to the encounter and finally to a Decisive Change. The closure (taking the clipboard) effectively reconfigures his identity from tourist to helper, paying off the setup with concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.0)
    The logic of a letter arriving through the mail with "words scorched away" is distracting and unexplained. The resolution feels unearned; the conflict dissolves instantly upon Elias's arrival without a testing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure is a linear progression from anticipation to validation without a causal disruption or meaningful reversal. Closure is achieved through a "gift" epiphany provided by the prophet, resulting in a low-cost realization that feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with low causal pressure; events happen sequentially (he arranges photos, sun rises, dove appears) without forcing a hard choice. The ending provides a "soft reset" epiphany—he simply realizes he is where he is meant to be—offering closure without the required felt or conceptual cost. The resolution is tidy and unearned by prior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building through experiments to a Conceptual Repricing of the city's mutations as memories. While the closure is legible and conceptually sound, the progression is linear and lacks causal friction; the experiments succeed without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure functions well as a cohesive loop, and the ritual logic is legible. However, the sequence is procedural—draw, arrange, receive, watch—lacking causal surprises or resistance that would heighten the narrative drive beyond a standard puzzle revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the causal link between the "sound of a leaf falling" and the decision to replace a shutter with a clock hand operates on dream logic rather than mechanical or character causality. The orientation is also slippery; the "lunar observatory" looking at the moon while falling to Earth creates conflicting spatial cues (orbital vs. atmospheric) that distract from the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and competent, moving smoothly from arrival to closure, but the narrative lacks causal tension or a meaningful turning point. The scene plays out exactly as requested by the dying character without unexpected obstacles or complications, resulting in a "check-box" feel to the progression.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path (unlock door, turn key, fix world) without causal complication or meaningful setbacks. The logic of "closing the loop" is asserted rather than dramatized, and the resolution arrives as a gift from a helpful NPC rather than a hard-won consequence. The backstory about spoons feels disconnected from the immediate causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative path is frictionless; the ritual works instantly and the maze yields without exacting a visible price, resulting in a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned. The closure is happy but lacks the "felt cost" or sacrifice required to give the ending weight under the rubric's standards.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path, but the resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the magical object solves the problem without a visible cost or consequence. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—she needs the pearl, finds it, and it works perfectly—which undercuts the narrative tension and fails the high-band requirement for a felt price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from isolation to a shared ritual that functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation is clear, though the transition from the viral video backstory to the present scene relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sequence of encounters provides a clear structure, but the spatial logic at the resolution is contradictory: the current is described as pushing him back (toward shore) and trying to expel him, yet he turns "against the current" to wade "back toward the shore," creating a confusing physical vector.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: stimulus (tendril) leads to action (singing) leads to success (magic). The resolution is unearned by tactical adaptation or sacrifice; the magic simply obeys her, resulting in a convenient "symmetric satisfaction" ending. There is no visible cost to the restoration of the practice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building a ritualistic rhythm that lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the narrative arc is linear and low-friction; the protagonist succeeds without significant causal obstruction or unforeseen complication, making the victory feel slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure where the goal shifts from preservation to release. The causality of the repair—prying with a quartz sliver—relies on dream logic, which fits the genre but softens the "earned" nature of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is functional but resolves via a soft reset; Liora ends the conflict by simply deciding to stop ("not hers to keep"), rendering the stated risk ("turning her bones to bronze") toothless. The ending feels unearned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.0)
    A significant causality break undermines realism: carving a recognizable, steady-gazed lion from ash (a hard wood) in the time it takes a kettle to cool (~15–20 minutes) is physically impossible. The time compression renders the climax unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, functional arc from arrival to release, fulfilling the Accumulative/Situational lens. Closure is legible via the Resonant Reconfiguration of dropping the wheel. However, the inciting incident is backstory-heavy, and the climax relies on a static conversation with a projection rather than active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent but relies heavily on the convenient coincidence of finding the sextant and its owner in immediate succession without obstacle. While the closure works as a Conceptual Repricing (redefining hope), the lack of causal resistance or complications makes the progression feel linear and inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The plot relies on the bear as a coincidental *deus ex machina* to physically lead the protagonist to the resolution, bypassing causal drive. The ending asserts closure via a soft reset ("made peace") without the requisite "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" demanded by the high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is competent and linear, with clear orientation and a legible sequence of events. However, the plot relies on a "magical object explains the plot" resolution, which reduces narrative tension. The closure is distinct (Conceptual Repricing) but feels mechanically delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative reads like the opening chapter of a novel rather than a complete short story; the ending is a "setup" (finding a clue/location) rather than a closure unit with paid cost. There is no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, merely the acquisition of a plot coupon ("Weeping Shoals") that points off-page. Causality is linear and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (planting the thread). However, the scene is largely static with retrospective movement, and the closure, while thematically legible, lacks a strong sense of immediate cost or structural inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc from mechanical failure to magical success, satisfying the drive lens. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the transition from the "mournful note" to the sudden understanding of the "genesis" flaw feels slightly rushed in terms of logical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no inciting incident or causal drive; the arrival of the child triggers exposition rather than conflict. Closure is a soft "teaching moment" that lacks a decisive change, felt cost, or reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails the closure requirement; the ending ("filled with light") is a soft reset that avoids dramatizing the consequence, cost, or content of the discovery. The plot is a linear fetch-quest where the protagonist follows instructions without facing causal obstacles or making a choice that alters her trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence, but causality operates on dream logic; the mechanism by which a gear "transmits light" to "break the pattern" of war is purely metaphorical, lacking concrete grounding. Closure lands on a resonant image, but the resolution is too easy—Kael accepts the shift without resistance, bypassing the necessary struggle or cost to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative tension dissipates completely with a summary montage ("Over the following weeks") that violates the short-story scope of a continuous scene or tight shard sequence. The inciting incident (finding the ribbon) leads to a diffuse resolution where the protagonist merely waits for weeks until a note appears. This structural break flattens the causal chain, turning the climax into a reported event rather than a dramatized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (restoring balance via shared burden) lands clearly under a Situational/Magical logic. The mechanism of the resolution is linear, functioning smoothly without a sharp causal twist or complication to test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies on a severe causality break where the tapestry threads function as a magical GPS, pointing to specific physical locations ("led him to a niche," "red thread took him to the riverbank") without establishing a logical mechanism. The narrative structure is a low-stakes fetch quest driven by this unearned convenience rather than character agency or deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure with no inciting pressure or reversal. The climax—writing the future—proceeds without complication or unexpected consequence, resulting in a "just-so" ending that lacks a felt cost or decisive turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear instruction-execution path without a Decisive Change involving visible cost; the ending relies on "soft magic" success. The resolution fails the cost proof test, as the protagonist sacrifices nothing to achieve his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the portrait revealing his face) provides a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the mask appearing out of nowhere and providing a convenient vision acts as a shortcut to resolve the backstory mystery, weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.3)
    Causality breaks significantly at the central discovery; reading detailed political conspiracies (bribery, poisoning) from layers of sediment on a cog strains credibility and acts as "magic solving" in a purportedly rational investigation. The inciting incident leads to closure via a logic leap rather than dramatized proof.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict is resolved via a summary montage ("By the third... By the fifth..."), which violates the standard of dramatized proof for literary fiction. The pivotal shift from fracture to harmony happens in the white space between paragraphs, creating a "soft reset" that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative breaks the short-story container by jumping from an urgent countdown ("hours away") to a montage ("Days passed"), dissipating the established tension. The closure is legible but feels unearned because the primary obstacle (growing the seed) is bypassed via time-lapse summary rather than active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on convenient exposition (Maren immediately knowing the sabotage plot) and "dream logic" where a riddle magically rewrites itself to provide instructions. The subplot of sabotage is introduced but resolved without confronting the antagonist, and the climax lacks mechanical plausibility within the established world.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from setup to action to consequence. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the house's nature is understood differently—lands with conceptual clarity. The "pause" moment serves as a strong, tangible irreversible change within the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear inciting incident and decisive closure (releasing the bloom). However, the causal link between the statue's explanation and the diver's action relies on immediate acceptance rather than a tested process, making the middle beat feel rushed despite the strong structural bones.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a legible closure effect (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the staircase physically tilts. However, the causal mechanism—dice altering infinite stone—operates on symbolic logic that feels thin given the "mathematical" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path from stasis to resolution with no significant obstacles; the "wrist locking" is overcome instantly. The closure is a plan to distribute art, which feels like a gentle next step rather than a decisive change forced by pressure with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and a "magic fix" ending where a simple domestic act resolves a systemic collapse without proportionate effort. The causality chain is tenuous—baking one loaf inexplicably restores an ecosystem and self-repairs a tapestry—resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central pivot relies on an unearned intuitive leap ("Elias knew") rather than the established logic of reverse-engineering, shortcutting the discovery phase. The closure acts as a clean reset but lacks mechanical causality in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on a "manual of operations" structure where a dream dictionary provides the exact solution at the climax, removing trial and error. The resolution—touching the mirror because the book implied it—lacks earned causality or visible cost; the threat simply evaporates upon contact. The ending is a soft reset where the "cursed" status is wiped clean without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative trajectory, building density toward a resonant finale, but it lacks the required friction or cost for high-band closure. The ending acts as a triumphant realization ("he was the one being heard") without a visible price paid or options foreclosed, reading more as a vignette of success than a narrative arc. Orientation is solid, anchoring the surreal setting effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the inciting incident (opening the crack) transitions logically to the climax. However, the spatial orientation of the watchers relative to the cracks is slightly fuzzy (watching from the horizon vs. guarding cracks in the shell beneath the city). The closure is a Decisive Change, but it rests on the protagonist ignoring the immediate danger she just fled, which weakens the causal chain of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The orientation and inciting incident are solid, but the resolution relies on a convenient off-page "private collector" arrangement that dissolves the central dilemma without on-page cost. This "win-win" outcome acts as a soft reset, bypassing the difficult choice between exposing the truth or preserving the myth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is effective, using the rising water as a ticking clock to pressure the ritual. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the repetitive beat structure (find note, write note) feels slightly mechanical before the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on the coincidence of finding the exact ledger containing his family name in a massive library, which shortcuts the investigation. However, the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible and carries the felt cost of isolation from the waking city.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on summary ("She made more lanterns...") to bridge the gap between the first experiment and the climax, diluting scene tension. The closure ("the world *transformed*") is an abstract conceptual shift that lacks a concrete, felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story functions as a prologue rather than a complete narrative, failing the closure requirement by ending on a "to be continued" hook ("The hunt wasn't over") instead of a decisive change. The central scene lacks a causal turn; the protagonist demands information, receives it without struggle, and leaves, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure resembles a prologue or a "call to adventure" beat rather than a complete story with a resonant closure unit; obstacles yield instantly to the specific technology without testing the protagonist. The ending offers a change in location but lacks a visible, paid cost or a meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's internal state beyond simple acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies heavily on a convenient coincidence: the uncle appears exactly when Elias finds the symbol and immediately volunteers the necessary information ("Your father paid me..."). This helpful-NPC interaction resolves the central mystery of the scene without requiring Elias to exert pressure or make a difficult trade-off until the very end. While the closure (breaking the watch, choosing to chase the truth) is a valid Decisive Change, the path there lacks earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The scene follows a clear Accumulative arc, building atmospheric pressure toward the dawn. However, the spatial action at closure—turning "toward the path down" while prisoners "would arrive soon"—creates a slight ambiguity: is he leaving, or leading? The ending relies on Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of a distinct causal turn limits the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is complete, and the disposal of the compass provides a legible Decisive Change with sentimental cost. However, the island appears conveniently ("gravitated toward") to stage the climax, and the resolution feels structurally tidy rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly. However, causality relies on "dream logic"—the baseball acting as an unexplained compass and the binary tunnel choice lacking established stakes—which makes the progression feel mechanical rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and efficient, following a clear causal chain from intent to ritual to consequence. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is solid, with the return of the lover in a new form resolving the plot while instituting a permanent change. The pacing works well for the length, though the "fortune" element feels slightly retrofitted into the causal flow rather than organic to the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions well as a lyric shard with a clear ritualistic structure. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration ("binding past and present"), though the causality is associative rather than strictly pressure-driven. The narrative arc is coherent under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving clearly from the ritual of stitching to the ship’s departure. However, the resolution relies heavily on the locket functioning as a "key" at the critical moment, which solves the central problem without requiring a decisive, hard-won turn from the protagonist. The closure is legible and valid as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the climax dampens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot hinges on a convenient "oracle" encounter where a stranger explains the protagonist's destiny and uses a magic mirror to resolve his doubt. This removes agency; Elias runs because he was shown he would, not because he made a difficult choice under pressure. The inciting detour and the meeting feel like contrived setups rather than organic causal links.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence, but the climax relies on a fragile causal link: lighting a single torch inside an armory is accepted as a city-wide signal without established setup. The logic of a sundial predicting a blackout is shaky, and the protagonist faces no meaningful obstacles, making the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist (notice problem -> apply dust -> place rocks -> fix world) without causal complications or setbacks. The solution relies on a *deus ex machina* where the painted rocks' arrangement suddenly "made sense" due to a convenient voice, removing the need for protagonist ingenuity. Closure is a symmetric restoration of stasis with no visible cost paid.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure forms a coherent vignette with a valid Conceptual Repricing closure ("maps meant to be carried") that reweights the initial desire. However, the pivotal epiphany relies on a coincidental lightning flash rather than a causal turn driven by the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story functions as a prologue rather than a complete narrative; the ending ("The journey had just begun") avoids closure by promising a story off-page. The mechanism of the needle card and sundial relies on dream logic that lacks causal grounding, and the resolution comes without visible sacrifice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on the convenient arrival of Elias exactly as the library is unlocked, which undercuts the protagonist's agency and creates a feeling of unearned synchronicity. The closure—a commitment to the resistance—feels like a foregone conclusion from the moment the key is introduced, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or risk that would give the decision weight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal arc is tight, linking the discovery of the film reel directly to the climax; the "loophole" mechanic is established early and pays off. Closure is excellent: the broken clock ticking offers a Resonant Reconfiguration that signals the end of his frozen grief with visible atmospheric cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a strong inciting incident and a satisfying conceptual twist at closure (the monsoon as a partner, not just a storm). However, a choreography slip creates confusion: Liora plucks the seed from her satchel, but moments later Nani presses "the seed" into her palm, muddling possession and spatial logic. The pacing of the climax—planting to reading to resolution—feels slightly compressed, relying on rapid magical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story relies on a "soft reset" logic where a magical ritual (lace + compass) smoothly solves the protagonist's internal conflict without complication or failure. The causality is driven by the prompt objects acting as deus ex machina tools rather than character agency forcing a difficult trade-off; the ending brings relief without a legible price.

    Causal lens (shell murmurs → desk/cast → notes decryption → floorboard/photo reveal → confrontation) holds with on-page Charged Poise closure ("let’s start over") reconfiguring relationship/identity; cost legible in caretaker's "I tried to protect you" and Mira's unflinching gaze. Orientation anchored early (Mira in rusted library under stars); single scene fits scope.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hush, pauses, clattering pebbles builds to CR closure where silence reconfigures endless night, cost in booklet's dust legible at "now little more than dust." Orientation anchored early in shore/fort/star. One tightening via ambered hush revelation suffices.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of continuing to watch reweights her vocation under the Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the quiet forfeiture of grander quests, though the beat is a single static stance rather than a tightened turn.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: fire → ledger → frost pattern → confrontation → choice. Orientation is clean by line 6; the canyon night anchors who-where-when. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she pockets the evidence, accepting complicity and the canyon’s wider war—cost is visible in the weight against her thigh. One minor slack: Jaren’s “they were going to burn the whole canyon” arrives as unmotivated exposition, blunting the because/therefore chain a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the heat-map eruption rewrites silence into a visible score, undeniable on the page. Causal chain holds—fork → glass → color → language—each step triggered by Elias’s agency. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“conservatory’s winterglass panes”). No teleporting props or logic breaks; the 20% reflective block is interleaved with present action, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lenses ignite, the city breathes, and the undertaker’s reading voice becomes the new “light,” a charged poise that reweights every prior beat with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is clean—lens arrival → memory → return → revitalization—each “because” link visible on the page. The reflective block (library memory) is anchored to the present object and tilts his stance, satisfying BRR. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are clear by line 5. Lens holds accumulative/textural pattern to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the second bell plus children’s chime reweights the premise—memory work is now shared, not carried by Liora alone. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each anonymous gift and nightly run thickens texture until the ridge itself vibrates with echo. Cost is felt in the “amplified quiet” final image, implying future peril without declarative underlining. One minor slack: the second bell appears by luck, not protagonist action, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tear’s transfer reweights the premise—unused love’s storage site is externalized, not hoarded. Causal chain holds: memory surfaces → method practiced → stranger arrives → gift given → breath reveals path. Fog-parting mechanic taught early and paid off at climax. Cost is unmistakable: Lien permanently relinquishes the relic that anchored her identity. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: fading photo → shard discovery → reversal → garden doorway → sacrifice → restored photos with her own aging as cost.

    Causal chain is clean: arrow warning → key map → vault access → dawn departure, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—locking the vault and walking toward a green future reweights prior captivity with conceptual cost (“they’ll find it eventually”). Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final sentence: chains feel lighter, hope already exacting its price. Missing the 9-band only because the scavenger beat resolves by brandished arrow rather than protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cooled foil reweights the grandfather’s quest into Elias’s acceptance, with the aurora-lit forge as visible cost. Causal chain holds—because he was betrayed, therefore he seeks the absent sound; because he finds only silence, he settles for “something.” Orientation is swift; greenhouse, tide, and cancer clock are anchored by word 80. One minor causality bump: the wife’s lie is revealed as past-tense summary rather than a dramatized trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the couple’s renunciation of the train crystallizes a new collaborative stance, the jar’s glow supplying visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: shell → cast → box → photo → recognition, each link forcing the next. The photograph delivers a decisive change that reconfigures both relationship and self-definition, paying the cost on the page. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only the caretaker’s late arrival feels slightly convenient, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is completed in silence and the last star vanishes, re-weighting her world. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught by 25 % and holds. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the loops collapse into a crystallized moment whose cost is the unending pursuit itself—“some questions weren’t meant to be answered.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each layering of twilight deepens the stake rather than resets it. Orientation is swift—frozen courtyard, twilight, janitor, violin all inside 120 words. No teleporting props; the ice violin is present throughout and its final hum reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain: withheld lens → ticket-map reveal → reciprocal confession → joint reset. Closure is a Charged Poise: the re-inserted lens and humming crystals reweight silence from barrier to beginning, cost legible in their exposed vulnerability. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden’s final gift reconfigures the entire 40-year struggle, and the cost is felt in the empty fountain and the gardener’s emptied pockets. Causal chain holds: each marble placement → garden response → map marble → seedling, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One sentence of overt thesis (“Mended deception, he thought”) is the single cosmetic blemish, not enough to breach 9-band integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lever-pull reweights the station’s reality and Elara’s self-definition with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: humming xenos → hologram sync → lever → temporal breach → alarms. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only slip is a brief explanatory lull (“she had proven it”) that slightly blunts the beat’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank program and darkened house reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—program → water → Elias → violin → played symphony—each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. One tightening: the rising water narrows options to “play or remain silent.”

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: illustration → encyclopedia → dig → photograph → renunciation. Each beat tightens Elias’s options under the Situational lens until the final Earned Stasis (“breathed without the weight”). The photograph note acts as the irreversible cost, reconfiguring his prior guilt; closure lands with felt weight and no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush after the wheel is returned reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—the mill’s ghost labor is acknowledged and Elias’s trespass is silently judged. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory beat thickens the ghost-shift memory until the final cessation of clanking crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of witness→release taught early, lands in Charged Poise as the book dissolves and silence reasserts. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure carries conceptual cost (she relinquishes possible authorship), but the absence of a middle beat that tests her grip on reality keeps the tightening modest. One shard, one transitionless scene, inside 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the curl becomes “a beginning” and the meadow song roots the crowd, a resonant reconfiguration with felt social cost (he must now parent). Causality is soft—Liora’s arrival is coincidence—but under Accumulative/Textural lens the pattern holds: curl → creek hush → girl → eclipse chorus, each layer deepening the stake. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact (tapestry, diaries, silo hum) layers density until the dragons’ gleam reconfigures reality; the closing image of the axis “pointing somewhere else” delivers a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—she forfeits the safety of mere collecting for an unmapped threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is tight: cookie clue → smudged log → lens-bend search → microdot reveal → stranger’s arrival → Elias accepts conductor role. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options; the microdot payoff reconfigures what “retirement” meant and forces the final stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise: he steps into the song with undeniable cost—his father’s life was never what he believed. The only minor drag is the off-stage boat engine as coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stillness is not void but mirror, reweighting all prior sound-layers with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop thickens density until the single chord collapses options. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors (altar, pedal, anchor walls) are clear by line 5. No causality breaks; the palette’s earlier ruin-backstory cues the violet’s later spread.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horizon “cracked just a little” by remembered sound-conducting, cost legible in her exhausted vigil. Accumulative lens holds—each memory shard adds density until the mirror fractures—but the cookie aphorisms function as off-page catalyst; tighter causal stitching would sharpen the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias releases the door, collapsing timelines; the rain-soaked viaduct re-anchors him with quieter whispers—cost is the surrender of omniscient possibility. Causal lens holds: each beat (tablet touch, door offer, release) links because/therefore. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One minor soft beat: the tablet’s rule-set is learned mostly through effect rather than early setup, but payoff justifies the delay.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the filament of hush thickens until the final tap reweights silence as playable. Orientation is swift—cavern, two characters, shared goal—and the broken needle’s first appearance at ~100 words anchors the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s “emptiness changed” is legible, felt, and irreversible; the cost is the lifelong labor of holding that silence. One causal link remains implicit—how the snapped needle actually transmits “hush” onto skin—but the pattern is taught early and pays off without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the courtyard listening session intensifies pattern until the hidden gear-sound reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the storm recorder becomes a “promise,” reconfiguring Elias’s observer identity into participant with conceptual cost. The beat is earned by the prior auditory accumulation, but the cost is still more emblematic than visceral; a sharper bodily or social price would push this past 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias shoulders grief with the vial no longer a wound but a whisper—cost legible in the prism-tear and steadying lantern. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-density increases, UV glow reweights the stake, final dawn softens shadows to crystallize acceptance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50; no penalty. No causality breaks; father’s absence motivates every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rope-pull reweights time from abstraction to living membrane and leaves Lirien holding the spent cord—cost is visible. Causal linkage is thin (rope = key is asserted more than tested), but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of touch / pulse / loop tightens the pattern until the final cadence break. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. One soft spot: the prisoner’s history is told rather than foreshadowed through sensory cues, a minor causality patch.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: lyrical looping of music → echo → fish → silence re-cast as anticipation. One tightening beat (the answering hum) reweights the stake, but no option is foreclosed; she simply leaves. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise, yet lacks visible cost. Orientation clean; structure holds but stays single-register.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine holds: petal application → grief transfer → parting promise; the final image of the dull petal re-prices the premise by showing Liora’s own need for fresh lies, a quiet CR with visible cost that satisfies closure under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: misdelivery → recognition → reciprocity → fund pledge, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Decisive Change with light social cost (Elias commits time/money). Orientation clean by 50 words; single transition (library→inn) legible. No persistent constraint or price returned to Elias personally keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor absorbs the sculpture and prints her hand, making belonging materially legible with felt cost—the reed child is gone. Causality is clean under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (glass branches, silver lake, charcoal pulse) thickens the stake until the pattern breaks in her favor. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty applies. One shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands: time visibly bends as sand flows and the world dissolves—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin (she simply “reaches out” and it works), but the lens holds as situational pressure crystallizes into a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the orchard’s answer rather than forcing causal reversals. Orientation is swift; moon, cavern, eyes anchor by line 4. Closure lands as Charged Poise—presence is re-weighted, not returned—yet the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping it shy of 9-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain is clear—tape find → outage cover → cache check → Mara intrusion—but closure is withheld: Elias neither steps forward nor loses anything now; the story simply suspends. Because no decisive change, renunciation, or charged poise lands here, the required closure unit is missing, capping the score regardless of earlier competence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of kneeling in rain crystallizes the new stance—study replaced by surrendered witness—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern (storm-season upheaval, leaf-in-pocket, bark-silver shift) tightens once and lands with conceptual cost: her life’s method is foreclosed. Causality holds; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide erases retreat and the brooch burns between joined hands, re-weighting all prior amber imagery with the cost of irreversible entanglement. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (rain, resin murals, tide) tightens the noose of drowned stories until the painter steps into the pact. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“tidal island…sea retreated twice a day”) and no teleporting props occur. The only minor drag is the woman’s explanatory chunk inside the cave; it slightly flattens the escalation right before the final image, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s music is diminished and the unseen is now predatory, a clear before/after shift with felt cost. Causal linkage is present—pearl cracked → shadows fed → pilgrim lost—but the pilgrim’s reversal (“hands shake as she tried to pull back”) is too late to make her complicity legible. Orientation is clean; the lens is causal and holds. One non-closure slip: the dream of “overlapping shadows” is never tethered back as foreshadowing, so the rule change feels mildly retroactive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: exile ended → valves collected → erased map revealed. Orientation is swift: ivory harbor, night-after-storm, satchel weight all land inside 120 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the etched map reweights the city’s history with undeniable social cost. One minor slack: the watchtower door opens on a favor we never see earned, but it doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: punch arrives → cracks beckon → manhole opens → tunnel offers closure. Orientation lands by ~90 words; the 3:17 timestamp and mist-locked alley teach the rule-set early. Closure is a Decisive Change—he takes the conductor’s hand, punch burning—cost is felt as physical heat and the whistle that splits the dark. One minor slack: the fortress of unspoken truths is named but not foreshadowed, so the final stakes leap a half-step.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tile dims, the notebook is full, and Elias stays to watch—cost is the responsibility of carrying strangers’ memories. Causality is thin (whale-song coincidence triggers the tile), but the accumulative lens holds: each memory shard adds weight until the final image reconfigures his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: stolen fragment → Kael’s intrusion → storm peak → Veyra’s channeling → Kael erased and Veyra scarred. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80; the final image of cold amulet equals Earned Stasis with cost visible in the burnt palm. One causal leap—how channeling “dimensional awareness” alone banishes Kael—is off-stage, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the pot on the counter between them re-weights every prior con rule; Elias’s “prove it” crystallizes options with undeniable social risk. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat (discovery, test, intrusion, standoff) tightens because/therefore linkages. Orientation is anchored by sentence 10 (prep room, formaldehyde, night); no disorientation serves the ending, so the Orientation Test is waived. Cost is legible: Elias has just weaponised his mother’s funeral-home stage against her ethos, inviting state reprisal—an irreversible tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lamp’s silence and the whistle re-weight the premise, costing the stationer his solitude and completing his archive. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hum, note, whistle—held cleanly to the end. Orientation is swift (spectacles, bench, bonsai by line 2), no debt applied. The final line crystallizes meaning, but the missing-page beat (fresh ink) is accepted without investigation, a fractional slack in cause.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide rising while Elias touches “Daniel Mercer” reconfigures his quest from flight to acceptance, and the cost is the surrender of ever finding a clean origin story. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of found fragments builds to this crystallized moment. Causality is loose but coherent: each port visit adds a layer, not a because/therefore chain, fitting a story about erasure. The woman’s appearance functions as a coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the last cello note re-weights all prior sound imagery and forecloses the debunking path with felt cost (“this wasn’t the end… it was the beginning”). Causal chain—shell → hum → vision → cello → choice—holds without gaps; orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). Minor slack: the fisherman’s prior advice is retro-injected rather than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: graffiti warning → Lan’s sabotage → elders’ quiet sanction → vote-eve poise. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (gentrification still looms), but the lens stays situational; the raft “survives because we choose it” reweights options without a visible price paid by Lan herself.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal arc—arrive, witness, record, let go—lands a clean Earned Stasis: he switches the suit lights off, leaving the crater to its fate. Orientation is immediate; closure beat carries visible cost (“he turned off his suit’s lights”). No causal gaps; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned drone’s steady pulse re-weights the earlier “stutters and gaps” into navigable direction, proving Elias’s credo on the page. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tactile repair beat thickens stakes until the water-refraction test gives permission to launch. The single causal micro-turn (drone leaves / drone returns) is sufficient for 700-word scale. Cost is felt in the final image: the humming wings against his palm while the ship vanishes beyond sight—an irreversible parting he chose.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake journey crystallizes options with conceptual cost—the ice may remember or forget, narrowing her atlas certainties; causal chain (message → phrasebook → pattern → demand) holds, though keeper’s late entrance slightly dilutes motivation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden shimmer of invisible foot-traffic reconfigures Hollow’s End from silence to listening, and the cost is the tuner’s perpetual exile. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each day’s footfall pattern layers density until the cadence itself becomes the decisive change. Orientation is swift, the single transition (day 3→5→7) is legible, and no causal promise is broken.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the temple’s silence shifts from predatory to “vast,” Lira’s empty vial the visible price. Causal chain holds—signal leads → temple feeds on memories → vial offered → current released. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One causal gap: how the perfume’s starlight “unsnarls” the hush is asserted more than shown, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: by speaking his name Elias reweights the rule-set, turning the lighthouse beam back on and the hush from predator to fugitive. Causal linkage holds throughout—because he shatters the lattice, therefore the beam re-ignites and he flees with the ledger truth exposed. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible in the shattered lattice and the irreversible exposure signaled by the revived beam.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s warmth becoming a “second heartbeat” reweights the entire debt and forecloses escape with felt cost. Causal lens holds throughout—because she grips the bead, memory floods and stance crystallizes. Orientation is secured by line 3 (“winter solstice for seven years”) and the pattern is taught early; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loom scene reweights the premise from “break the labyrinth” to “be sewn into it,” with orchid wind as felt cost. Causality is soft-lyric (Accumulative/Textural lens); the overlapping footprints pattern teaches the surreal logic early and holds. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. The beat-to-beat linkage is more poetic accretion than because/therefore, acceptable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each unearthed fragment tightens the stake of “restore lost faith.” Closure lands with CR—roots blooming from bones re-weight the premise. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image. Orientation is clean by line 3; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: chalk numbers → letter memory → dawn arcade → maternal reveal. Orientation is clean by line 8; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the golden light re-casts Elias’s lifelong identity-making as self-search, cost felt in “clipboard suddenly heavy.” One minor elasticity: mother’s off-stage knowledge of the PO box is unexplained, but the emotional logic overrides.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—discrepant star maps → pattern recognition → encoded date → whisper-campaign → thwarted coup—lands cleanly, with a visible conceptual cost: the observatory’s isolation becomes the very lever that moves the city. Closure is a Charged Poise: Liora at the window, candle steady, revolution echoing—options re-weighted, her safety foregone. One minor warp: the “synchronized errors” leap is asserted more than demonstrated on the fabric itself, a thin spot in the linkage. Otherwise the lens holds and the ending reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of condensation messages, shard pulses, and song density tightens stakes until spoken confession reweights regret. Closure is Charged Poise—options re-cast, apology still unsent yet no longer failure. Persistent constraint (shard’s weight, spirit vigil) shapes final image. Cost: acknowledgment of fear aloud in hostile liminal space, felt immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aligned casts and glowing “Home” reconfigure fear into communal meaning without dissolving danger. The coral-key logic is taught early (“remembers the shape of fear”) and paid off when the fragments pulse in unison, forcing a visible cost—her exile from evacuation safety. Causal chain holds: coral call → decrypt cast → shared glow → stance crystallization. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the print fixed to the wall reconfigures the orchard’s meaning and the community’s stance toward loss, with the “apple within reach” image paying visible conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each light-soaked exposure layers density until the final image reweights the stake. The 120-word orientation anchor is met (who/where/when taught by line 5), and the single transition (darkroom→morning return) is legible. No lens ambiguity or artifact touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trumpet lifts, the nickel burns, Elias is invited through—cost is the foreclosed path of safe restoration. Causal chain (nickel contact → dishes spin → mural opens) holds; orientation is anchored by 80 words. One minor causality bump: the garden’s autonomous tilt is asserted, not cued, but the effect is paid off in the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: gourd → warp plan → first garden message → inevitable spread, each step tightening risk. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts surveillance exposure by pocketing the map; cost is legible in the inspector’s lingering gaze. Orientation is swift—greenhouse, cicadas, taxed-thought city rule by line 6—so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/lyric lens: each sensory layer (pinhole constellations, off-key breeze, postcard flicker) tightens the emotional aperture until the poem becomes the inevitable release. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shell projects his fractured face, the postcard edges soften, the lullabies escape—reconfiguring grief into shared sound. Cost is legible: the poem remains wet with tears, the universe “decides to forgive,” and his insomnia is unresolved, the path ahead still foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the single note dissolves, an orchid answers with a stranger’s name, and her lifelong ache “softened, just a little.” The moment carries undeniable conceptual cost—she will keep tending echoes that can never echo her back—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift: floating opal library, caretaker alone, present-tense tending within 60 words. Causality is loose but coherent: each artifact accumulates emotional density until the bamboo’s accidental note triggers the final resonance; no off-stage shortcuts or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shattering ink-well releases the symphony, reconfiguring silence into expectant openness with conceptual cost (“she had not restored trust, not yet”). Causal chain holds—each spoken syllable escalates ink response—though the voice’s external agency slightly blurs protagonist causality, holding score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the floodgates become “listening,” not silencing, with conceptual cost—she surrenders absolute safety. Causal chain holds: letter decryption → reframed goal → final adjustment. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint (the mountain’s breathing) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elias refuses further self-erasure and stays to reconstruct the Lament, cost legible in the pigeon left cooing outside. Causal chain—ledger → lyric sheet → offer to collaborate—tightens once and suffices for 700 words. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. One minor lapse: the fire is retroactively introduced as total loss, but the ledger’s survival is never explained, a teleporting-prop nick that keeps this just under the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sets the prism down and accepts the threshold he cannot cross; the cost is the visible absence he now carries. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each refracted image deepens the stake of irretrievable loss. Orientation is clear by line 5; no penalty. One scaffold paraphrase (“the wood was warm, almost alive…”) slightly dulls the final beat, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: feather → map → chamber → belonging, each beat logically triggered by the prior. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias foregoes remaining in the living city, accepting exile with “the rhythm…a silent promise,” a felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. A single tightening—sunrise deadline—narrows options cleanly. Could edge higher if the cost were more viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: seed + acceptance reweight the premise “some pieces stay missing” with undeniable emotional cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift in final paragraph reconfigures meaning. Causality intact—bird-seed trail → cave → glass → seed—but middle lacks tightening beat; escalation is gentle pattern break rather than forced choice. Orientation clear by word 90; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arcade’s hush becomes collaborative music, reweighting her private ritual into shared risk—cost felt in the vanished bishop and the unrepeatable after-hours moment. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tide, lantern light, and stranger coalesce; no causal chain is broken. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. The only drag: “orchestrated serendipity” is declared twice rather than demonstrated through visible tactic, slightly blurring agency.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden darkens, the stone stills, and exile mutates from solitude into shared fate. Causal chain holds: moonstone heat → star-gap perception → tattoo act → joint outlawry. One soft spot: the nostalgia ban’s off-stage brutality is told, not shown, slightly diluting the causal punch. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine holds: dream → dock → atrium → stone-throw → vision → insight; each step is legible and the closure image (light always waiting) lands as Conceptual Repricing with quiet cost. However, the dream’s propulsion is thin—no concrete constraint or ticking clock—and the old woman’s entrance gifts the final cue rather than forcing Elias to test his stance, so the tightening is soft, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair sit rewriting the bargain under shifting stars—options reweighted, silence traded for shared witness, cost legible in the pen pass. Causal chain: find box → hear loss → offer page → rewrite; no gaps. Orientation anchored by 80 words; single transition up ridge; lens (Causal) holds. Only nit: the stranger’s age-twelve flash is summary, not scene, so the decisive change feels half a beat shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building (shell spirals, dream balloons) intensifies until the gauge’s hum reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—bridge image crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is satisfied by line 3; no causality breaks. Minor slip: “trial balloons” equation is stated late, not tested on-page, so the conceptual reprice is slightly abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing map reconfigures legacy from knowledge to warning with conceptual cost. Causal chain—diary coordinates → corridor → woman → map—holds; the negative motivates forward motion and pays off in her presence. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible (“the walls… tired of being forgotten”) but could be sharper if Elias forfeited a live option (retreat, destroy the map, etc.).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last line crystallizes a new perceptual state with undeniable conceptual cost—she now bears the borrowed heartbeat alone. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal; pattern is taught early via prism refractions and lullaby echoes, tightening until the final brushstroke reweights reality. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is felt, though off-stage—no concrete consequence is shown on the page, keeping it just shy of 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the monks’ chant and the aligned planets crystallize a new joint stance whose cost is the unknown future they now share. Causal chain is clean—coin gift → symbolic reciprocity → ritual assent—without off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is swift: terrace, midnight, adversaries, treaty within 120 words. One minor slack: the clipboard’s lightning origin is told, not used to motivate any beat; it doesn’t break causality but slightly dilutes constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Situational lens: the salt flat becomes a charged crucible where stance crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg remains, rivers will return, Elias abandons his legacy—cost is the impending erasure of his engineered world. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; pattern holds. Micro-turn—the silent tap that ends the drought—lands with conceptual price. Missing only a hairline causal tether from drawer memory to the exact timing of release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prism dims, Liora’s voice is found, and the courtyard mirror reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—“no longer just a temple, but a testament.” Causal chain holds: untangle → unlock → harvest → re-voice. Orientation is swift; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held without slippage. One minor scaffold: “the weight of her chastity a vow as heavy as the winter itself” tells what the ice and breath already show.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dome’s returning light reweights the premise—stories can be questioned, not just told—while the candle’s gutter and re-flame make the cost felt. Causality is light (Accumulative/Textural lens): because she speaks the echo-story, the room “takes a breath,” a pattern break that crystallizes stance. Orientation is swift; stakes legible. Yet the decisive turn is more image than irrevocable choice, nudging it short of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the monarchs lift, the grotto “forgets,” and the signal’s impermanence becomes the felt price. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each fragile structure adds density until the final cadence shift—so the lens is coherent. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no teleporting props or retroactive fixes. One tightening beat suffices at this length, and the ending image (“the space between the beats of a heart”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new braid-layer thickens the pattern until the rope’s vibration delivers the resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable felt cost—“the names were safe now… warmth of forgiveness.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is on-page, final image reweights all prior hollow/void imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the directive flips from preservation to choice, the key materializes, and the storm-walk carries felt exposure. Causal chain is thin—dream woman’s gate appears by invitation, not by Elias’s prior tactic—so the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of seal imagery and vine guidance reweights stakes rather than narrows options. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One micro-turn (seal fragments → key) suffices for this length. Cost is more atmospheric than consequential, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile dissolves into a future library, reweighting the premise from binding stars to seeding knowledge. Causal chain holds: theft → incantation → offer → renunciation → shard. Orientation is anchored by word 80; the oculus star mirror is set up and paid off. Cost is palpable—he forfeits the tile and any future claim on power—so the lens (Causal) remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pin glows, silence fills with possibility, and the choice to “learn to dance” forecloses revenge with felt cost. Causal chain is sound—pin reappears → cellular memory triggers → resentment released—though the sanctuary’s rule-set is revealed retroactively (“reappears when needed”) rather than seeded. Single-scene orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty applied. One micro-turn (pin whole again) is allowed; no second decisive change, so lens stays Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored sextant and receded fog reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost—the mirror maker now carries what he once only reflected. Causal chain holds: sextant hum → path opens → climb → trust → dissolution of mountain. Orientation is swift; lens (Situational) is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the repaired fracture and shared peach reweight the premise—safety is internal, not artifactual—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the orchard’s density of blossom and vow-shedding literalizes the cost. Causality is lyric but legible: because Liora mends and speaks, the girl can offer fruit that tastes of persistence. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard tilts, the shell becomes a “path,” cost is the lifelong pursuit now unavoidable. Causal chain is thin—epiphany triggers external shift rather than choice—but the Accumulative lens holds; pattern taught early (ledger scribble) pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: backward watch → lost key → negotiation → door → sister. Orientation is swift and spatially legible. The final image reconfigures stakes—sister alive, library real—carrying clear conceptual cost: the path back is unspoken, time may be irreversible. One minor causality fuzz: the map “dissolves when read” yet is later “crumbling” in hand; the rule inconsistency nicks credibility but does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald card dissolves into fog, reconfiguring twins into one mythic entity—cost is the erasure of both selves. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each artifact (card, tarot, ledger) deepens density until the garden re-prices identity itself. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Minor time-line fuzz (how long is Elias aboard?) doesn’t breach the image. Still, the final beat is more tableau than irreversible act, keeping score just above the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished door and new braid-pattern make the obliteration of House Vaelis undeniable and re-weight Liora’s future duty. Causal chain is clean—seal glows because rope is re-braided; vision is triggered because seal is touched. Orientation is swift: archivist, clock-tower, midnight, impossible door all inside 80 words. One minor slack: the voice from the shadows is never sourced or paid off, a dangling beat that slightly dilutes the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: map → stone → bloom → binding → flight. Closure is a Decisive Change: silence is portable now, bloom gone; cost is the lost refuge. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: “stone flares” alerts beings off-page, but the beat still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the horizon flicker re-weights the premise from “last light is dead” to “light is waiting,” and Elias’s solitary walk carries the conceptual cost of abandoning the only home he still tends. Causal chain is thin—prism → momentary refraction → distant pulse—but the accumulative pattern of star-charting and memory-visions supports the final shift under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ending lands a resonant reconfiguration: Elara rejects the elders’ taxonomic safety and steps onto the bridge, reweighting the premise that memory can be archived. Lens is accumulative/textural—pattern of refracted echoes and slanting shadows—held cleanly to the final image. Orientation is taught early; disorientation is functional, so no penalty. One beat of overwriting (“weight of all the things she had yet to live”) slightly dulls the closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing fortress and the silent figures reconfigure the stake from “defy hopelessness” to “remember it,” with the spent rag and her kneeling as visible cost. Causal chain holds: mosaic note → travel → ignition → revelation, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is clear by line 5 (“dusk,” “stone petals,” “kerosene rag knot”). Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. One transition—entry into the fortress—is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cicada’s disappearance reweights the “pause” with ancestral depth and visible cost, forcing her return to the suspended conversation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds through mirrored immersions until the final image reconfigures stakes. Orientation is swift: grotto, night, tidal pool by line 3. One soft spot: the centuries-ago indigo woman is summoned only in dream, not tethered to present action, slightly diluting the causal web.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the trellis will remain and so will she, a resonant reconfiguration that costs her the safety of never-knowing. Causal chain is clean: inversion → trellis appears → father’s prohibition → her calibrated exposure → boy’s recognition → mutual pledge. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Lens is Situational—pressure of inverted world forces stance crystallization—and holds to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single scene, single POV, clean orientation by 50 words; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (spiraling glass, prismatic light, returning whistle) tightens once when Elias stops the boat and the glass stills, landing a Charged-Poise closure with felt quiet as cost. No causal reversals are required under this lens; the deepening cadence suffices and is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal spine holds: mural clue → peel → stair → throne. Orientation is swift; kaleidoscopic waterfall and silver leaves anchor us by line 5. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn light reweights the grove—yet the cost is world-abstract, not character-sharp. No persistent constraint or price is carried forward by Veyra herself.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared scar touch reconfigures both lives and the sanctuary’s rule-set, cost felt in the simultaneous exhale; causal chain is thin (child arrives by authorial fiat) but the final image reweights all prior threshold imagery, satisfying RR under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: bolt → texts → coordinates → porthole → renunciation, each beat tightening the supernatural contract. The midpoint “quantum promise” reveal re-orients stakes without breaking continuity. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: counter-turning the bolt seals the portal and forecloses the swap; the warm diamond in pocket is visible cost. One minor causality bump: the phone messages stop instantly after the refusal with no in-world cue, but this does not derail the final lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the standing-wave reveal reweights the stake from “fall” to “erasure,” forcing Elias into a new, weaponized knowledge. Causal chain is tight: heirloom doubt → crank → bridge resonance → spectral testimony → Council signature. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—his family’s voice was stolen and he now possesses the tuning key.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine holds: found program → woman’s offer → surrender → bodily hoist; the orientation anchors within 120 words and the final image (“the oath is not to the puppet, but to the dance”) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with conceptual cost. One minor warp: the program dissolves into embers that “swirl around her fingers,” a teleporting prop that breaks physical logic for a beat but does not rupture the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the returned button + note reweights the archive’s purpose under Accumulative lens. Causality is thin—postcard discovery is serendipitous—but the pattern of dust-to-postcard accumulation is taught early and pays off in the final image with felt cost (“weight…no longer a burden”), satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: key → hatch → console → broadcast → hesitation of enforcers. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (capture inevitable, but illusion cracked). Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single-scene default is met. One meaningful tightening—uploading the drive—reconfigures the world’s knowledge state. No lens ambiguity; the boot-level resistance plot stays legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is not destroyed but quieted at visible physical cost (“lungs burned,” weight lifted from case). The causal chain—decipher → play → absorb → hush—holds start-to-finish. Orientation is immediate (“morning fog,” “prism atrium”) and never clouds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the circle of stones and shower of lit leaves reconfigure Liora’s life toward perpetual translation of arboreal text, with the moss on her sleeves the visible price. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each leaf, speck, and monument layers density until the pattern break crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift; the arbor’s geography and twilight timing anchor by line 3. One minor causality gap: how moonstone “multiplied” overnight is elided, but the lapse doesn’t derail the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of broken timepieces + erratic compass → waterfall portal → clockwork city. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s frozen rhythm stutters when Elias’s clock awakens—uncertainty weaponized. Cost is conceptual (the city’s order destabilized) rather than personal, keeping it just under the 9-band. Orientation is clean by 120 words; transitions from workshop → greenhouse → cavern → city are sign-posted and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the coin’s return and the word *Forgive* reconfigure the dyad’s entire rule-set under the Accumulative lens—every soot streak and chisel mark now reads as intentional gilt. Causality is clean: the carved name triggers recognition, recognition triggers forward motion, motion delivers the coin back with irrevocable cost (the foundry still collapses around them, time short). No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the warm coin’s physicality keeps pressure taut to final line.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the collector pockets living laughter and steps into dawn, cost felt in the warming tooth. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory shard adds weight until the final reconfiguration—but the woman’s exit is unmotivated coincidence, not causal turn, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equations rearrange, mercy is revealed as a variable, and Elias’s stance crystallizes into “knowing when to stop.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each ultraviolet image thickens until the grid appears and reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—UV forest, post-surgery, present-tense action by line 5. The vial beat supplies the single meaningful tightening required at this length; no off-stage shortcuts or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse lens is redefined from missing relic to perpetual search-anchor, with the cost of endless incompleteness legible in the final line. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard (market, painting, attic writing) deepens pattern rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is clean within 120 words. No teleporting props or retroactive patches. One micro-turn—realizing retrieval is the honoring—suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust layers, the mainspring, and the ceiling fracture tighten the same stake—time leaking—until the sealed crack and caramel-corn scent deliver a Charged Poise with conceptual cost; causality is thin (why the barrel seals the wound?) but the pattern is taught early and paid off in image, satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the glass library’s dissolution and lone tree re-weight the premise—perfection shatters and something rawer replaces it. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: whisper → rupture → frost pattern → page sacrifice → collapse, each step tightening the texture. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (no face messenger, floating orchard) is taught in the first 120 words and pays off in the final bare-tree image. One soft spot: the page “drinks the silver light” but the causal mechanism that converts ink-void into universal reset is asserted rather than shown, keeping the beat just shy of 9-band credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors blank, Elias spent, the asteroid’s voice restored—cost is legible in his rasp and empty glass. Causal chain holds: shard → ritual → voiced verse → Core team halted. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices; no teleporting props or causal amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the golden light and “tinkersong” reweight prior rust and fracture imagery with undeniable conceptual cost—he is no longer the repairman who avoids truth. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the chip’s pulse causes memory surfacing, which therefore motivates the final insertion. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The only drag is the stranger’s gnomic exposition that slightly over-explains stakes before the final beat, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed, humming vial crystallizes that Elias now carries the lagoon’s memory-breath inside himself—irreversible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each beat (compass spin, warm water, risen figure) tightens the pattern rather than forcing a new plot turn. Orientation is clean by line 5. Only the grandfather’s prior expedition is elided; since it pays off in the risen image, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the lantern-slide shatter → mosaic woman → arch passage → cavern tableau accretes density until Elias’s bridge crystallizes the pattern. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge flares, turbines deepen, and “he didn’t know how long he’d stay” forecloses a return path with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one transition (arch-crossing) is legible. No causal break, though the cost is more atmospheric than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stained-glass epiphany reweights darkness from absence to illumination, foreclosing her search for external answers. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of postcards + glass layers tighten meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final brushstroke that commits her to the twilight mural.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: storm → letters → diary → lagoon → ledgers → escape. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon re-swallows the pursuers, repricing the past as an active predator; Elara’s airborne gaze carries felt cost—“the truth was safe—for now.” Orientation is clean inside 120 words. One causal leap—Lila happens to possess the exact rusted key—slightly strains linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: unopenable bottle → memory experiment → conjured wish → lanterns flare, hammers sound. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s silence is replaced by audible rebuilding, the cost is Elias’s abandonment of his anti-wish stance. One transition (table → cove) is legible; orientation is fixed by word 80. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each wax-cylinder capture layers density until the final playback reweights silence as invitation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—orchard breath + city grief archived inside one warm cylinder—cost is the stain on his palm and the foreclosed option of ever again hearing the city as noise rather than voice. Orientation is swift; the single time-shift to childhood is cued by tactile memory and paid off at the end, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warm cap and sleeping hatchling reconfigure the stake from nostalgia to custodianship, cost paid in the visible “unmaking” of frost. Causal chain is lean—cap-touch triggers vortex, greenhouse flash reverts, cap stays warm—held cleanly under a Causal lens; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she swaps wires → storm turns → she must re-pull; the final toll reconfigures her stance with visible cost (“she had been wrong”). Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses pure listening, accepts perpetual vigil, and the bell’s vibration through her bones is the on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the station becomes “a beginning,” the glass hums with remembered light—undeniable conceptual repricing with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds: each polishing, sweeping, and star-tracing beat thickens the texture until the slow star reweights meaning. The lantern glass pattern is taught early and returns to charge the final image. No causality breaks; orientation anchors within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: opening the box dissolves the ghosts and reframes Elias’s covenant under a Conceptual Repricing—the bees now carry memory, silence is no longer neutral. Causality is lyric-accumulative; pattern of ghostly gestures builds to the single decisive release. Orientation is swift: wasteland, hut, box, dusk all within ~60 words. One minor slack: the traveler’s past gift is told, not dramatized, but it doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final tagline “For the one who arrives too soon” reweights the premise from linear to circular time and Elias’s role from seeker to donor. The urn’s glow and the dream woman supply the felt cost, but the causal leap from “found fragment” to “I will seed garage sales” is compressed; one intermediate beat of resistance or failed alternative would have locked the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the snapped string → feather-quill → blank page becomes a Charged Poise that reweights grief into generative incompleteness. Causality is accumulative/textural; each image (feather, woven dawns, kite crack) layers density until the final cadence turns the stake from loss to ongoing song. Cost is felt in the ink-stained, salt-stung fingers—an indelible, visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the unfinished arch and the animals eating from his palm crystallize both legacy and inevitable loss. Causal chain is lean—wire-wrap → slow growth → memory—but sufficient for this length. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in the image “he would not live to see…”, re-weighting the orchard’s future.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the amber’s dissolution reweights “homecoming” from metaphor to chemical reaction, and the cost is the erasure of Elias’s evidentiary keepsake. Causal chain holds: amber → tower → catalyst → redefinition. Orientation is clean by line 6; no debt applied. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dust, footprints, vials, dawn light—tightened once when amber fuses the dust. Not quite 9 because the tower rule-set (how amber + dust = stance change) is asserted more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seeds in dark cracks + departing silhouette reweight the premise—reclamation is possible only after witness, not victory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt-rot, pod-rattle, heron wing-beat) deepens the stake of return. Orientation is swift: “blooming jetty at twilight” anchors where/when inside 20 words. Cost is present but diffuse; the line “his heart was not” names the price rather than letting an image make it felt, capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: riddle → cylinder → Hollows → re-entry, each step a because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis: he shoulders the old vocation, trading isolation for probable self-annihilation. The cost is felt in the final image—“walk into the dark”—which forecloses the safety he spent years buying. The Orientation Test is waived: the scrapyard’s skeletal geography is taught by line 3 and pays off when the drum becomes the portal.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the station shifts from prison to threshold and the compass re-orients from literal to chosen north, a reweighting paid for by the anomaly’s appearance and his act of drawing the living stars. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflective block is anchored to present tactile cues and the final image crystallizes the accrued pattern. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: because she wants the lid, she climbs; because she brought secrets, she can barter; because she accepts the riddle-cost, she leaves changed. Orientation is clean by line 6; the single-scene ascent/descent keeps scope tight. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “time is what seeks you” reweights the premise and the wrong sky pulses as felt cost. One minor slack: the guardian’s sudden generosity could use one more causal cue.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s “I will be the historian” crystallizes options while the pawnless board remains as visible cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—footfall pattern and echo density tighten until stance shift reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One meaningful deepening—her steps change from spelling to weaving—suffices for length. Cost is legible in the final image (abandoned board + echo that “would outlast them”).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the feather dissolves, the labyrinth reconfigures, and home becomes a shape to carve rather than find—cost is felt in the irreversible loss of the feather-guide. Causal chain holds: feather → journal map → descent → stone → dissolution → reconfiguration. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“mountain loomed… shelves of books”) and waiver applies; pattern pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: stolen labyrinth → village → tapestry trigger → mirror-memory → thread-burn release → stillness. Each beat narrows forgiveness path; no teleporting props. Closure lands with cost—seared wrist, re-knitted tapestry, final exhalation—visible in last sentence. Orientation anchor (who/where) secure by line 6; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each improvised couplet thickens atmospheric density until the spire’s glowing inscription delivers Conceptual Repricing—her words now carved, irreversible. Cause-and-effect is present but subordinate to pattern intensification; the final image reweights the premise, showing the price is speaking, not silence. Anchors (who/where) surface by line 4; no orientation debt. Closure beat carries legible cost—“her words” externally etched, foreclosing anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s golden fissures reweight Elias’s fragments into a coherent self, the cost the acid sea still waiting below. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern recognition and sensory echo build to the cadence shift. The orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One minor causality wobble: the charm’s sudden glow is unprimed, but it doesn’t break the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank canvas and “Remember” reconfigure the promise from recovery to acceptance. Causality holds—wrong turn → oasis → ledge → tunnel → blank canvas—each step narrows options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of return and echo reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the relinquishing lunge and the still-wet paint that forces him to begin again.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each handled object (cork, vial, scent) layers density until the final cadence shift—rain swallowing the shatter yet returning the note—delivers the Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the vial lost, the garden scent now uncontainable). Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequence, but the pattern is taught early (“whispers travel farther”) and closure reweights it: the world literally answers back. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lighthouse, dawn, storm edge), meeting the single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonlit horizon re-weights the censer’s pull, cost felt in “some paths weren’t meant to be left behind.” Causal chain, however, is thin: each midnight call is an off-page gift; the sister’s voice sets up but never pays off inside this scene. Orientation is clean by line 5; only one shard, so default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: find eye → test eye → reject eye → bury eye, each beat altering her options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the “safe silence” path and accepts permanent fear; cost is legible in the final line. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor soft spot: the textbook citation triggers the trial but the page is not shown, a slight ellipsis that weakens motive immediacy, yet causality survives.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s acceptance of custodianship for alien memories is charged by the image of the mist-revived flower, cost legible in the shift from routine to lifelong vigil. Causal chain is light but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard adds weight until the keeper’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the stranger’s death is observed off-page, slightly blunting the causal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: chip inheritance → ant trail → door recognition → insertion. The creek-rise clock tightens once, the chip-click is a clear Decisive Change with felt opportunity-cost (“for the first time in years… hope”). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat is clean, though the ants-as-mechanism is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror-touch dissolves her star-marked skin and re-casts her role under a new sky-covenant; the cost is legible in the phrase “something that hummed in her bones.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (raven scroll, firefly pulse, cobalt moss) tightens the texture until the final cadence shift re-weights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drop of twilight distillate onto the curl crystallizes a new shared stance—“Now we decide what to do with it”—with felt cost (the curl’s awakening, Elias’s lost “felt time”). Causal chain holds: curl gift → vanishing → return → shared decision. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One minor slack: the note “I’ll return differently” is off-stage exposition, not dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the door swings open, re-weighting all prior dread into an undeniable fork—confront the self or be dragged under. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated scroll/cabin imagery tightens the noose until the final image crystallizes cost. Causality is loose—no because/therefore chain—yet pattern-break at the end satisfies the lens. Orientation is clear by line 5; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the etched screw becomes Charged Poise—meaning re-weighted, cost felt in the hush before the chime. Causal lens holds: because Clara brings the screw, therefore Elias can transpose his own loss into visible marks, foreclosing his exile from meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. One tightening beat suffices at this length. Cost is legible in the final image (“he didn’t feel like he was missing something. He was holding it”).

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystallized rune glows with “warm pulse,” reweighting grief into voice; cost is felt in the burning fingertip and the imminent returning storm. Causal chain holds: because ink crystallized under stress, therefore she weaponizes that brittleness; shards self-assemble, therefore new rune; because new rune burns, therefore re-storying scars. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“floating rock tea ceremony platform”). One minor loop: “she dipped the quill…dipped the quill again” could compress, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cracked bottle releases the apology-sound and a drop of amber that sizzles on the wire—visible, irreversible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: because he hums the waltz and coils copper, the veil thins; because the bottle cracks, the apology escapes and forecloses any second attempt. Orientation is anchored within 120 words by scent, chapel damp, and curator dialogue. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the stake from ‘fix’ to ‘listen’.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hiccup smooths, Elara transmutes from witness to weaver, cost is implied in her erasure from the temple. Causal chain is thin—dictionary-to-stone jumpstarts cosmic repair without intermediate obstacles—but the accumulative pattern (fading words → final weave) holds. Orientation is swift; the single-scene default is met.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the blood-drop reboot reconfigures the rule-set (time = resistance) with visible price; causal chain (key → blood → horizon snaps) holds under Accumulative lens; Harkin log provides single reflective block within 20 % and anchors present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the farm-wide pulse reweights boundaries as doors, cost felt in the shared flare. Causal chain is thin—Mara’s spore gift is the single pivot—but it is set up by earlier laser-spore visual and holds under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the lantern burn rewrites the father’s equations and reframes the stake from “pay debts” to “seize the seams,” a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain holds—ticket scrawls → archive book → lantern ignition—though the midpoint traversal beats are compressed into montage, slightly thinning escalation before the final flare.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s “I’m ready” and Mara’s quiet assent reweight twelve years of loops into an earned stasis whose cost is the silence that now replaces them. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern builds until the pattern breaks—so the lens holds. Orientation is swift; tunnel, booth, and night hour are anchored by line 3. No teleporting props or retro-patches; the disc’s muteness and the callers’ disappearances tighten the final image without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the locket’s disappearance reconfigures the covenant from promise to acceptance, cost felt in the instant the water glows. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each salt-and-light image tightens the stake until the release becomes inevitable. Orientation is clean within 60 words; single-scene default met. One minor scaffold: “He had spent so long…” paragraph re-summarizes prior beats, but it does not break the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the station’s rule-set flips from “trade for a cure” to “pay loneliness forward,” with the moon rock’s forfeiture as felt cost. Causal linkage holds—every beat is “because Elias still hopes”—until the logistician’s refusal re-weights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (platform, ivy, dusk), well inside the 120-word window. One minor elasticity: the rumor chain is recounted rather than tested on-page, but since the closure doesn’t rely on verifying the rumor, causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ring points inward, the forest’s song relocates inside her—visible cost, no reset. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the pattern breaks at the glass-bark tree. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“she had never seen…”) so disorientation is waived. The causality is “because she keeps listening, therefore the song migrates into her”—one tightening, cleanly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora chooses editorial agency, the anomaly’s pulse and the nib’s weight reconfiguring her options with conceptual cost—the town may once more pay for her redraft. Causal chain is present (misplanted seeds → blurred history → choice to re-edit) yet compressed; the dream signal that “started all this” is referenced, not traced, so the tightening beat leans more on accreted mood than on a visible because/therefore turn. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; noTE: the anomaly’s rules are stipulated, not demonstrated, but the lyric design teaches the reader to accept them.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena accepts her vocation publicly, reweighting the camera from capture-tool to baton. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of silence-to-music—held cleanly to the last line. Cost is implied, not felt; the reader sees no concrete forfeiture, so the piece stops just short of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the key locks, not opens, and the tapestry’s final glow reweights every prior burn. Causal chain holds—each library fire exposes the next breadcrumb—though the Ember Scribe’s off-stage arrival inside the archive is a mild teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: serum → drumming → escape → lagoon; the drumming motif is taught early and pays off as the decisive actuator; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared dream re-ignited with visible cost (“serum burning hotter”). Orientation is clean by line 4; no teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral walk becomes the lock, key transfers, storm holds breath—cost is atmospheric and social, not private. Causal chain is thin (map → walk → woman) but coherent under Accumulative lens; orientation clean by 120w, no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the girl’s departure with the mica-lit pebble reconfigures both characters’ stances; cost is felt in Maris’s continued solitude and the town’s half-spoken fear. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of light/dark fragments tightens until the last glint of mica becomes the “star” the premise promised. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. Could edge higher if one shutter pattern had backfired, sharpening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the synchronized lights flicker alive as Elias crosses the threshold, reweighting the quiet rebellion with undeniable risk. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory beat thickens the hush until the town’s held breath is externalized in light. The sister’s vanishing is referenced twice but never given an on-page cue that would anchor the grotto’s rules, so the speculative logic remains slightly porous.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the island dissolves, the map blanks, Lirien returns lighter—an undeniable after-state. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the scrimshaw’s warmth and whale-call summon the island, and renunciation (not seizure) keeps it. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. The only wobble is the mother’s explanatory monologue, but the final image recharges the opening “ghost” motif, so the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sentence crystallizes the ritual as the last defense against unbearable silence, reweighting prior repetitions with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern deepens until the silence after the last line becomes the decisive change. Orientation is swift; causality is intact, though escalation is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptive layer thickens the same stake—poet vs. unsayable beauty—until the cadence softens into Charged Poise. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; the crack of ice at midpoint supplies the single required intensification. Closure satisfies RR: the boundary dissolves and the poet exits “not as a poet,” a reconfiguration legible on-page. Cost, however, is atmospheric rather than consequential; the piece never jeopardizes her safety, reputation, or future options, so the tightening feels aesthetic, not existential.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the canvas is still blank in one sense, yet Elias’s stance toward it has flipped from fear to invitation, and the cost is the surrender of chromatic precision he never possessed anyway. Causal chain holds: reed-woken jasmine → desire → painting-for-feeling → final cobalt stroke. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One micro-drag: the phoenix shard is introduced late, so its causal punch is more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell-ring adds density until the wall-hum reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s realization that connection is “not discovered but awaited”—with conceptual cost: the pilgrimage must stay unfinished. Orientation is swift; only one transition (ruin→lab) but anchors hold. No causal break, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reopened dome and blooming constellation reconfigure Elias’s stance with visible cost (thorned ink on wrist). Accumulative lens holds: each origami shard adds density until the pattern breaks skyward. Coordinates sequence risks mild teleportation, but lavender scent and deliberate pacing keep causality intact. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 5; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the anonymous reply reweights the entire deck from cultural artifact to live blueprint, cost felt in the instant shift from observer to participant. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each blurred card thickens the pattern that forces her text. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the loft, skylight, and bench anchor space and time. No causal or teleport errors, though escalation is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: archive dissolves into light once Elara relinquishes control, cost felt in the loss of both Kael and the texts she chased for a decade. Causal chain holds—her pattern-avoidance draws the Kael-remnant, his touch triggers pagoda, dissolution follows—though the final beat is slightly under-written; one more sensory shard of forfeiture would cement the price.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: overlaying footage revives the river on-screen, the shadow sharpens, hope is repriced as mobile, not frozen. Causal chain (stone warmth → footage merge → shadow solid) holds; cost is the unclaimed stone and enduring vigil implied. Orientation and lens stay clean; one transition inside the library is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trimmed tail and the first notebook stroke reconfigure Elias’s stance under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost (“didn’t reach his eyes”). Causality is clean—betrayal → shattered trust → altered craft. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props. A hairline slip: the poacher’s off-stage vanishing slightly dilutes the persistent constraint that could have sharpened final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the frozen hourglasses shatter and the coffee rings re-weight Elias’s “reading” gift, making the before/after legible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each frozen cascade thickens pattern until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by line 5; the tunnel discovery is a mild coincidence that complicates rather than resolves. Cost is conceptual but undeniable in the last two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the projector flares, lyrics appear, Mira claims the composer’s pen—an undeniable reconfiguration with conceptual cost (she’s now custodian of ghosts). Causality is lyric-accumulative, not strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and held. The single-scene anchor is clear by word 80; no orientation debt. One minor causality wobble: the pen “stolen from the vision” materializes without prior rule cue, but the final image absorbs the surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aurora accepts her, stories “already written,” exhaustion soothed. Causality is accumulative/textural—density of celestial imagery reweights the stake—but the decisive release is narrated, not forced by an irreversible action she takes. No new constraint or price crystallizes; the lens holds, yet the cost is only implied fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the backward-then-forward clock reconfigures his mission with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—touching artifact → teleport → new mandate—but the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the final image reweights stakes. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Enough for solid mid-band, not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear dissolves and the forest hybridizes, reweighting the rule-set with visible cost (loss of the map-object). Causal chain is thin—gear pull → dream → teleport → guardian lecture → dissolve—but holds under a lyric-accumulative lens. Orientation is swift; only one transition (sleep/wake) and it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the punch-in-air gesture reconfigures Mira from passenger to agent with conceptual cost visible in the lantern-lit cove. Causal chain holds—because she stamped her own ticket years ago, therefore she can stamp the air now—though the ferry’s scrape against “unseen rocks” is a mild convenience to force reflection. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal spine holds: missing bolt → climb → confrontation → refusal, each link tightening options. Closure is an Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the comfort of forgetting, paying with the uncertain path ahead; the price is legible in the blank staff paper he chooses to leave behind. One micro-drag: the “discoloration” clue is discovered off-page before the story starts, so the investigative escalation is slightly blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the scroll’s pulse and her sleeve-tuck crystallize a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with conceptual cost; causal chain (breadcrumb → rune → unbroken claim) holds, though the “unbroken” test is stated, not shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hidden atlas paths are reclaimed and the decision to keep tapping back is crystallized with conceptual cost—she now shoulders solitary custodianship of a suppressed past. Causal chain holds: torn page → deleted data → floor-panel hoard → reciprocal knock; no late rule changes or off-stage fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum’s roar crystallizes hope with tangible vibration-through-bones cost; causality holds under an Accumulative lens (density of image and sound intensifies), but the rebellion backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that slightly delays present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo dissolves, earth hums, future reconfigured with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—kite symbols → decode → unseal → release—holds; the plants’ escalating whispers tighten stakes. One soft patch: the Council’s prohibition is told, not tested on-page, so the first risk beat arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each shard (photo discovery, orchid vibration, cutting sprouts) tightens the same stake—how to live with unhealable loss—until the buried photograph re-weights meaning in the final image. Causality is lyric yet coherent; the orchid’s sway as listening device is the taught pattern that pays off at climax, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: “She didn’t believe in miracles. But she believed…in the way life persisted.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library re-expands and the portrait is re-born as non-figurative storm, re-weighting the premise from recovery to acceptance of unfillable absence. Causal lens holds: each rewrite (cards, canvas) is a “therefore” response to the tightening room. Cost is visible in the final image—he forfeits likeness itself. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 15; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses retreat by deciding to hunt the time-thieves, and the cost is legible in the drained ink and the boy’s returned breath. Causal chain is thin—why the drone lands on the child or why touch solidifies the ink is unexplained—but the lens is Situational: pressure crystallizes stance, coincidence only complicates. Orientation is complete by line 5; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the message “They’re taking the time” re-weights the eclipse from backdrop to antagonistic force. Meets 9+ quick test but capped at 7.4 because the causal gap between ink-grab and decision weakens the “persistent constraint” requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: theft of letter → Mirror vision → decision to plant → exit. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses silence by choosing exposure, cost signaled by “library sighed” and accelerating snow. One transition (library → chamber) is clean; orientation anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unclaimed bounty and wilting rose reconfigure both futures with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—sandbag cue → sheathe gesture → father’s pause → stalemate—under a tight Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. One minor wobble: the father’s final shift is under-motivated on-page, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single clear note and resettled stars reconfigure the world’s pattern with Kael as conduit; cost is implied in the warm spike and his lone exhale. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break → density → stillness. Orientation is swift; no因果 gaps. One tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because the archives are scrubbed, therefore she writes; because the nib is intact, therefore murder is assumed; because proof-by-contradiction is inherited, therefore letters → printworks → exhumation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “Then I won’t” crystallizes options and cost under the observatory witness. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—midnight sealing of wax—marks the point of no return with felt cost. All linkage survives the high-band test.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the tattoos permanently foreclose the option of forgetting, and the firmware’s hush is the immediate, legible cost. Causal chain holds—amber discovery → letters → translator → tattoo—each step narrows possibility. Orientation is taught early by the folded-time line and pays off when the screens show older Elias. One minor scaffold: “He had left them behind” repeats the prior cry reveal without new pressure, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing mandala reweights the premise—silence is no longer absence but accumulated memory—while the tile flake’s insertion supplies visible cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative lens; pattern break at the end is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the renamed plaza and the re-inlaid stone reweight the entire past, with the retained name *Amira* functioning as undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—finding the stone → reading the name → choosing to keep it while renaming the place—each step because/therefore. Orientation is swift (plaza, post-fire, night) and the lens (Causal) holds without wobble. Only a trace of outline sequencing (“She had done nothing” told, not shown) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s web of “might-have-beens” crystallizes when Liora takes Elias’s hand, accepting the price of phantom possibility. Causal chain is clean—coin-spin → fracture → echo-dance → choice—and the garden’s rules are taught through action, not exposition. The final image reweights the stake: the encore is not a performance but a perpetual haunting of potential. Cost is legible in Liora’s blurred silhouette and the coin left buried.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted threads crystallize a new lived stance with felt cost (“willowglass hope light as a feather”). Causal chain holds—shock → pill echo → body map → shared memory → acceptance—tight under 800 words. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (studio, blacklight, ozone). One minor causality bump: the placebo is swallowed mid-scene yet produces immediate perceptual shift with no cue that it’s psychosomatic; momentarily blurs lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cave swallows her, the fossil pulses, the air smells of pre-storm rain—an undeniable before/after with conceptual cost (she is now “voice” not observer). Causal chain holds: fossil dreams → cave warmth → entity → fusion; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“mouth of the coastal cave network”), waiving any disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the upward then downward sand re-prices the prophecy rule-set while the echo’s note makes the cost audible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each button sorted adds density until the pattern ruptures time itself. Orientation is anchored within 60 words (“amber warehouse clung to the underside of the cliffs”). No teleporting props or outline drift appear. The piece satisfies the 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (hourglass) shapes the final image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the key turns, the file is taken, the pillbox is left—an on-page ritual that reweights “fixing what’s broken” into “carrying what can’t be fixed.” Causal linkage holds: ciphered snow → pillbox → key → door → file → renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Zephyr Bluff”) and remains stable. Persistent constraint: the scar and the names he now carries visibly shape future tactics. No lens ambiguity; pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure achieves a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration—storm lifts, fog parts, and the ferry moves under “spindrift serenity”—but the cost is atmospheric, not character-won; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the final image reweights mood, not options. Because Elias’s knotting of the rope never faces a trade-off that forecloses a future (he could always re-stitch tomorrow), the beat feels cyclical rather than decisive, capping the score below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass heals and honey appears, reweighting the premise that the oasis “remembers.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fracture/repair and echoing hum tightens once—and the cost is legible in the smoke-flattened sky image that forecloses escape.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias relinquishes the paternal relic, crystallizing a before/after under the Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—rose death → girl appears → gift exchanged—though the rose’s symbolic weight is declared rather than tested on-page. Cost is visible in the empty pot and the gauge changing hands.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library reconfigures around her, the past and present “coexist without conflict,” and the cost is the unspoken solitude she accepts. Causal chain holds: sundial-shadow → correct book → spoken words → architectural response. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), one transition (memory shard) is cleanly handled. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure intensifies through pattern density rather than plot reversals—and the final image reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s paper lotus and the twig she now wears reweight her earlier search under Accumulative/Textural logic—pattern recognized, not solved. Causality is loose but coherent: each encounter (keeper → artist → mirror) offers a reflective surface that intensifies her self-recognition rather than alters external stakes. Orientation is swift; the temple, pond, and city installation anchor by ~100 words. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the search she once clung to—but felt in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the charts shift, Mara therefore rigs the subsonic generator; because she chooses silence, the tricksters’ hold loosens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“university radio station”) and closure lands a Decisive Change—static smooths, community tension drops—with felt cost: “the weight of the night pressing down.” No teleporting props; the generator is introduced early and used at climax. Slight deduction for off-stage tricksters resolving without counter-move, but causality inside Mara’s chain remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is clean: compass → revelation → dimensional ship wakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—‘spatial mutiny is freedom’—with visible cost (his world-frame shattered). The Orientation Test is waived: initial disorientation (fractured dome, no clear egress) is taught early and pays off when the entire ruin reconfigures into a vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sketchbook absorbs the lance, reweighting Liora from victim to remembered person with visible cost to Elara’s mission. Causal chain holds—ribbon → sister’s arrival → lance gift → drawing act—though the sister’s prior absence from police files is an unmotivated ellipsis that slightly frays credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (finding nail → decoding stanza → unlocking furnace) chains because/therefore. Closure is a Decisive Change: Mira crosses the furnace threshold, foreclosing retreat; cost is the howling wind and her pounding heart. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5 and never blur. No lens ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust-lace rail, pixel valley, rain applause) deepens the stake of “loading the world.” The glass flake reprise at tuck-in supplies visible cost, reconfiguring the pullout from pause to departure. One causal gap—hitchhiker’s scaffold wrap never loops back to constrain Lena’s tactics—keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rain starts, Elias pockets the bills, fox watches—an image that reweights prior circles into widening spirals with felt opportunity cost. Accumulative lens holds: each shard (father’s startup, circus relics, foreign money) layers resonance until the final cadence shifts. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is present but lightly legible—one more beat of bodily resistance could have sharpened it.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative pattern (three dreams → telegram → epiphany) tightens once when he realizes the inscription is "an invitation," producing a Resonant Reconfiguration; causality is soft—dreams supply knowledge without testing agency—yet the lens holds and the cost (loss of sole ownership) is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: failed trick → seed test → confession → thaw → mirror → child’s vow. Closure is a Charged Poise: the curse lifts but the social cost—her victim now armed—lands unmistakably. Orientation is clean within 50 words. No teleporting props; the seed’s rules are taught and obeyed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star-plain image reweights the covenant and the clipping’s pulse supplies felt cost. Causal chain is thin—pluck → meet → shift planes—but the dream-logic lens holds. Orientation is swift; the glade’s bruise-color and dusk light anchor by line 3. One non-closure slip: the woman’s sudden materialization skirts prior cause, yet coincidence is allowed under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the seed takes the memory, roots tremble, Liora walks away lighter-heavier—cost is visible and irreversible. Causal chain holds: burned card → stranger → seed → forfeited memory → orchard response. Orientation is swift: underground, night, single POV within first 60 words. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he authenticates junk → Roy offers pit lore → Lena appears → cloth is released. Closure is Earned Stasis: he keeps uncertainty but drops the totem, cost legible in “didn’t feel like an echo.” Orientation clean by line 5; no prop teleport. One minor causality slack: Lena’s arrival is pure coincidence, but it complicates rather than solves, allowed under Situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cuneiform rewrite reweights the premise—spirit migration is real, physics revised—while the notebook act makes the cost visible (she is now the new bridge). Causal chain holds: seed → fissure → script shift → her vow. Orientation is swift; “above the clouds” by line 1, no penalty. Lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative; the final cadence shift satisfies the tightening test.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drifting creel reconfigures the atrium’s contradiction-laden logic and leaves Elias in crystallized stewardship; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each book added is a beat that deepens density rather than pivots causally—yet the cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bunker walls blank, the pearl dulled, the crown left behind—cost is visible and irreversible. Accumulative lens holds: each dissolved confession tightens the pattern until her own fear is the last shard, reweighting the premise. The only hairline slip is the late introduction of the child-crown; its payoff works emotionally but arrives without prior causal seed.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ivy-choked station, graffiti layers, and the patched accordion build density until the final image of walking “toward the river” re-weights guilt from paralysis to motion. Orientation is clean by line 6; causality is looser but coherent—each graffiti line acts as a micro-turn that tightens her stance. Closure meets Resonant Reconfiguration: the path forward is crystallized, cost felt in the station whisper and the still-slung accordion. The only drag is one beat of motivational recapping (“She wasn’t looking for forgiveness anymore”) that slightly dilutes the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library dissolves once she authors the unspoken letter, reweighting the premise that “time is a story we tell ourselves.” Causality is lyric-associative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. The watch’s final midnight stance provides visible constraint/cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. One soft spot: the unwritten letter’s content is withheld, so the decisive change feels slightly under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she plays, therefore plants bind, father vanishes, destiny rewrites. Orientation is swift—velvet observatory, midsummer twilight, ice violin—within 60 words. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the city-map stain flips to a woman leaving, cost legible in the shattered glass and vanished patriarch. One causality hiccup: father’s off-stage disappearance after vine-trip lacks immediate consequence on Elara’s body/thought, a micro-gap that keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the threshold mood until the emerald’s dimming reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pause between breaths—felt cost is the chip’s extinction and her inevitable return. Orientation is swift; no causal break. One soft spot: the revival beat is slightly too gentle to tighten options; hence not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dissolving the hairpin reweights the rebirth premise and carries quiet cost—she relinquishes the relic of her pain. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught early (scallop shell, grotto pilgrimage) and holds to the final image. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; one soft teleport—“the hairpin dissolved”—is allowed under lyric license and does not break lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse shifts from courtroom to confessional, sunlight replacing judgment with shared uncertainty—cost is the lingering absence of absolution. Causal chain is thin—Elias’s only “act” is asking one question—but under an Accumulative/Textural lens the chimes, mirror, and dawn light successfully reweight meaning. Orientation is secure inside 120 words. Lens holds; cost is conceptual, yet legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—time-stepping reframed as presence—with cost signaled by vanished rings and younger hands. Accumulative lens holds: ripple pattern tightens until stillness reweights stakes. Orientation clear by line 5; no causality break. Beat sequence is iterative meditation, not escalating chain, so tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the seam-door opens, the skimmer’s chord rewrites the canyon’s echoes, and Elias steps into “the spaces between steps”—a conceptual cost that forecloses ordinary motion forever. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because-therefore, but the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights all prior echo imagery without contradiction. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single drop blooms into a living star, reconfiguring his definition of success with undeniable conceptual cost—he can never replicate this act. Causal chain holds: keystone command → unstrapping → dissolution → fountain gift → flower. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One minor loop—“his fingers numb, his magic too weak to warm him”—is paraphrased twice but does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky reconfigures meaning, the tag passes, and the lens stays Accumulative—pattern of light-images tightens until perception flips. Causality holds; the library discovery and the woman’s arrival both complicate, not solve. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reframed as mirror, coins reweighted as questions, static resolving into one note—cost is the relinquished certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of distillation attempts → static bursts → final listening cadence tightens meaning without causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 60; no disorientation served at end, so no waiver needed. One shard, single POV, within length default.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern builds through repeated naming, listening, and light-fracturing until the blank page reweights meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when land in the first 60 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas blanks, the beam vanishes, Elias is “silent,” and the cost—his hoarded names are spent—hits on the final line. One minor causality gap: the mechanics by which “scattered light” crystallizes into solid form are not seeded, but the lyric pattern absorbs the moment without breaking the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cracked bell’s raw note reweights the premise—rebuilding is listening, not perfect mending—cost is the retained cracks and the still-tilting world. Causal lens holds: each drip beat → bronze change → fish answer. Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint (bell’s fracture) shapes final tactic: gentle stone strike, not restoration. Cost legible in “laugh… brittle as the bell’s devotion.” Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: each photograph tightens options until the distillery lantern forces a because/therefore decision. Closure lands as Charged Poise—pocketing the photos reframes the levee’s future with undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (crystal, starlings, waterfall hues) layers density until the pattern break of shattering ice reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: options reconfigured (“let them dance”) with conceptual cost—she abandons quantified certainty. Orientation anchored within 50 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each climb move is a because/therefore linkage propelled by the snapped branch crisis. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (city lights, arbor spine); the closing image of brighter city lights reconfigures the stake—proximity to the world he only watched—delivering Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the harness gouge). One minor scaffold: the phrase “soundless echo” is used twice without tonal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: each beat because/therefore—spar failure therefore insight, insight therefore attack, attack therefore cracked numbness. Closure is a Decisive Change: Kael’s stance shifts from “I need to feel” to “Either way, I’ll be moving,” foreclosing the dojo safety with physical leap. Cost is legible in the final image—bare feet leaving solid stone. One micro-turn mid-scene suffices; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: seed → soil → note → redesign → final stake. Each gift mechanically forces the next move, but motivation for the sender and the “they” remains off-page, so the ultimate threat is abstract. Closure lands as Charged Poise—lantern off, petal unfolding—reconfiguring her safe space into battleground with visible cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blower’s death and dropped handle create Charged Poise—options reweighted, laughter released, Elias walking away unpaid. Causal chain holds: off-key drone → family listening → girl steps → smile → mother laughs; each beat is a because/therefore. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt (fuel gone, anonymity lost), satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the garden’s mist, ink, and frost accrete into a mind-scape that climaxes in the blank book filling with her fear-words—an effective CR image. Orientation is swift; the single transition (garden → clearing) is legible; closure lands with conceptual cost. However, the pendant’s rules and the guardian’s criteria remain off-page, so the final beat is more resonant reconfiguration than decisive change driven by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the goal is redefined from gold to newness itself, and the cost is the annihilation of the mentor’s relic. Causal lens holds: each explosion follows because Elias keeps feeding the fire; the final image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and remain stable. One minor loop—“the second explosion came, then the third”—but causality is intact and the ending image is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the tower falls (visible cost), Mira vanishes into the “shard of hush,” and the rule-set is repriced—time folds, beginnings/ends collapse. Accumulative lens holds throughout; each sensory layer (rusted girders, lunar pull, interpreter hum) tightens the texture until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is established by line 3 (“radio tower city of Vaelis… gorge”), well inside the 120-word waiver. No causal break or convenience; even the fragment’s dissolve is pre-figured by geometry matching the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ferry still, the lantern steady, the commuters gone—cost is felt in the emptied space. Causal chain is thin, however; the hourglass hum but no beat shows Elias using it, so the merge feels willed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the door vanishes, the void reconfigures his options, and the alive texture of connection is legible. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each illusion intensifies because the thread accumulates his memories—but the thread’s unexplained origin is a mild teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain holds: alien arrival → star-reading obsession → chain-link template → refractive tools → successful sighting → new horizon declared. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s boundary myth dissolves in a single charged image (“the stars are our new horizon”) with conceptual cost—deep culture must reinvent itself. Pressure tightens once, cleanly, though the beat where thecity elders accept the shift is compressed to a nod from Tael, muting the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s smile accepts merger with the chorus of dead voices—cost is the forfeiture of safe return, legible in the mist’s recoil. Causal chain holds: photograph → Elias → corner → Miriam → acceptance. Orientation anchors by line 5; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “last photograph in her pocket” repeated twice within 30 words.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s kneel and the swallowed gold reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; causal chain (codex path → phase transition → renunciation) holds, though the midpoint shift into the wall-route is taught only by image, not foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ghost’s final line reweights the premise—Elias’s life is no longer borrowed but observed—at visible cost (he stops counting). Causal chain holds: death-certificate error → guilt → observatory → ghost → shard release → heartbeat renunciation. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “He thought of…” trio could lose one beat, but none touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: canyon falls silent, diamond now vessel, language death reframed; cost is conceptual (echoes displaced into gem) yet not felt on Elara’s body or future. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density rises from starlings to bone grooves to refracted cracks—one transition, single scene, so structure defaults are met.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s metamorphosis is irreversible, cost visible in glowing veins. Causal chain holds—arrowhead warms, phone invites, he accepts—though the moment of consent is compressed to a single smile; a beat of explicit choice would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: shell heartbeat → rhythm hack → vine eruption → leap. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and again at shard break. Closure is a Charged Poise: the speaker’s music spills into the mechanical street, reconfiguring the world’s silence with undeniable cost—her bow will never rest. Persistent constraint: statues keep coming, bow remains in hand.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jammer click, rain start, and bottle stowed reconfigure options with felt cost. Causal chain holds—undeliverable letter → Mira’s run → shared risk—though the watchmaker letter never loops back to tighten the final choice. Orientation is clean within 120 words; one-scene default met. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of absences intensifies to the final image without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the halo clicks, the oasis blooms, the carousel whirls, and Elias stays—cost is the irreversible abandonment of the ordinary world. Causality is lyric-accumulative: song → halo flare → train shudder → tents restored; each step is textured, not arbitrary. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single shard holds. One soft spot: the “wrong turn” motive is declared but never dramatized, so the inciting breach is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scarf stays warm, the door vanishes, options re-weighted. Causal chain is thin—scarf as key is asserted, not tested—but the accumulative pattern (repeated Tuesday visits, scent cues, geometry metaphor) holds together under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One persistent constraint (the scarf tether) shapes the final image, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative pattern (dream → palette → light-painting → photograph → crossing) tightens once and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared palette/photograph reweights the “cipher” into mutual recognition; cost is felt in the solitary dawn climbs and the admitted incompleteness of “Not yet.”

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine—lock of hair → starlit ritual → braided key → idea freed—lands a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the village must confront its buried guilt). Orientation is swift, the single transition back to the village is legible, and the closure beat carries undeniable reweighting; only the locksmith’s unmotivated certainty keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: missing stars → return → ring re-opens → sister’s half-presence; the gap of forgotten summer is the pivot that lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (“You took too long”). Orientation is clean inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara hands the cup to Mira, symbolically passing the vigil, but the reversible exile premise remains intact and no path is actually closed. Causality is loose—Mira’s arrival asks questions but does not force a decision—so the lens reads Accumulative; the tightening is gentle, the cost off-stage, and the ending hovers rather than lands.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bud’s ruby-gold swirl visibly reweights the world’s color palette and confirms the orchard’s rebirth, with Maren’s trembling hands supplying felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each refrain of her wordless song thickens the shimmer until the travelers cross, not because/therefore but by density. Orientation is clear by line 5; the waterfall–parapet–tree anchors hold. The piece obeys single-scene default, one transition (seed → shoot), and the mosaic pattern is not taught, so lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each knot loosened releases a voice that deepens the stakes, therefore propelling Elias toward the irreversible mask-puncture. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the scream of the threads and the King’s tightened grip make the price visceral. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“prism sanctuary shimmered under starlight”). No causality breaks; the stolen-needle backstory is motivated and paid off in the final stab.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the child’s shoe reweights the torn map and the silence Elias has parsed for years; the cost is the sudden audible whisper that forecloses his former anonymity. Causal chain holds: torn map → footage comparison → pry → shoe → re-cognition. One minor elasticity: the chapel door opens on first try after decades, a convenience that slightly softens the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: find globe → read notes → meet Liora → shatter globe = let ship go. Orientation is swift—submerged library, 70-year wreck, night dive—within first 100 words. The single shard structure tightens naturally; no mid-scene teleporting or retro-fixes. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: by destroying the key Elias forecloses personal proof and academic glory, a price legible in the silver plume that drifts away.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ghost’s “Enough” reweights the courtyard graffiti into Earned Stasis, the bolt-plate fused as visible price. Causal chain holds—lute call answers graffiti plea, iron key completes encoding—though the ghost’s prior agency (how she can rearrange paint but not speak) is elided, a minor fracture under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s refusal to keep probing is dramatized by placing diary and goggles on the desk, foreclosing her trespass with visible price. Causal chain holds—diary discovery → refraction trick → recognition → renunciation—under a single contiguous scene. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the telescope reveals the Astraea, re-weighting the sky from witness to accomplice and crystallizing the leap as inevitable. Causal chain—broken string → cloud log → telescope vision → rail climb—holds without gaps; each beat tightens options. Orientation is swift (gondola, twilight, brass scope by line 3). Cost is felt in the final image of wind against coat, no safety net named.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she turns the key, sees perfection, then renounces possession—cost is the foregone relic and the coming demolition. Causal chain (coin-map → safe → renunciation) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat deepens the stake of “containment versus reverence.” No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and never blur.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern projection reconfigures the world-rule (“the airship is a compass”) with conceptual cost—every future route now depends on shadow-reading. Causality is clean: starlings → board → lantern → new wind. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt applied. One tightening beat suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias assumes custodianship of a living mechanism, cost legible in the flicker that shows the clockmaker’s scattered consciousness. Causal lens holds: each beat (oil uncap, kneel, gear placement) is a because/therefore step. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the prophecy scraps act as off-page shortcut for the machine’s cosmic scale—slight motivational leap, not quite a break.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final bell-ring crystallizes the villagers’ transformed stance and Liora’s fade carries felt cost (“her form glowing brighter than the nebula”). Causality is light—messages appear by ghostly handwave—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn message tightens communal attention until the orchard sings back. Orientation is swift; floating arches and nebula are anchored by word 60. One transition (dawn-to-dawn) is legible and patterned. No late rule-breaks; the bell’s last toll reweights all prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lullaby passes through the pane, waves still, options re-weighted, cost legible in the dissolved clock and softened puppet smile. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of spirals, hush, and ripple re-iterates until the cadence shift lands. Orientation is taught early (“lighthouse… jagged spit… dusk”) and the final image repays the initial disorientation. No lens ambiguity; persistent constraint (pane’s silence) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: nut-map discovery → blueprint correlation → silent breadcrumb tactic → traveler spared → curse held for one more night. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80; cliff-edge orchard, mechanical birds, and frost deadline are legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s burden persists, but Mira’s tactic has re-priced her role from hands-on savior to invisible sign-post, cost visible in the final image of uneaten fruit under frost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is cleanly legible: she decides to design self-healing polymers and re-enter life—Conceptual Repricing with professional and emotional cost signaled by “grief loosen its grip.” Causal lens holds: foam pattern → insight → notebook sketch → plan. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The sister thread remains off-stage, so the personal stake’s cost is abstract, capping the resonance below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vanished bottle and the widening door reconfigure Elias’s options with a felt conceptual cost—he forfeits certainty for possibility. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each image (incised name, sigh-coin, dissolving key) adds weight until the final image crystallizes the stake. Orientation is swift: “glass orchard library drifted upon a swirling sea of clouds” anchors who/where by line 1. No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: tidal patterns, rain, coral pulse reweight grief’s stakes without causal reversals yet closure lands via Charged Poise—shared burden felt in the warming coral. Orientation is swift; only one transition (pavilion interior) and it’s legible. Cost is visible in the final image (“the tidal formations pulsed…warm for the first time”), locking the before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the swinging weight reconfigures the town’s siloed lives and Mara’s vocation under a single audible heartbeat; cost is felt in the tower’s groan and the workers’ hesitant first hum. Causal chain is lean—overheard talks → poster → gathering → song—but coherent. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one soft time-jump (“weeks passed”) risks diluting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces repair, accepting the woman’s fractured memory as-is, with the canyon’s hush confirming cost. Causal chain—find → glimpse → risk of possession → refusal—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank book absorbs her marginalia and reconfigures her identity with conceptual cost—she leaves carrying a secret flame. Causality under an Accumulative lens holds: doodles → path → book → new role. Orientation is taught by 80 words; no penalty. One minor slack: the “hour of inversion” rule is announced late, not foreshadowed, so the price feels slightly exogenous rather than earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence is broken by a raw, imperfect breath whose cost is the sculpture’s further fracture. Causal chain—find relic → map cracks → insert resonator → strike—holds without ellipsis. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. The insulator’s re-purposing is foreshadowed early, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant’s meaning reweights Elias’s exile and the choice to remain, cost legible in the fading glow and the dent pressing his palm. Causal chain holds—because he correlates, therefore he sees; because Lysara guides, therefore the pattern unlocks. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One minor slack: the “next phase” clock is declared but never tightens options on this night.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp opens not by violence but by shared frequency, reweighting the premise that silence must be broken to be understood. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each failed frequency adds density until Liora’s arrival crystallizes the pattern. The only abrasion is a mild coincidence—her entrance at the exact experimental moment—which slightly dilutes the cost legibility, preventing a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is clean: the stillness insight reweights the premise with conceptual cost—she accepts the wait. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory note, doodle, and elder warning layers density until the final line crystallizes the stake. The grandmother journal beat is a touch too convenient—information arrives exactly when needed to pivot Mira’s stance—but because the insight still carries an undeniable price (the seed’s multi-year dormancy), the beat passes. One tightening, one reconfiguration, no orientation debt; lens coherent to end.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow cools, seeds drift upward, and the inverted world is accepted rather than fought. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (humming air, glowing fruit, warming metal) tightens until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the city’s final exhale reweights the premise with undeniable cost (“the containers sealed shut”) and Elias’s earlier pattern recognition becomes the very trap he anticipated. Orientation is swift; causality holds; the only minor drag is the single-sentence “He had to get out” which tells urgency already shown by the sprint.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “sculpted hush” lands as Charged Poise—the cavern, aurora, and chisel all fall silent under the white-note, reweighting the stakes with felt cost. Causality holds: each bell-ring is answered by aurora-shift or ice-hum, and the chisel strikes function as because/therefore obstacles that narrow options until the final bell. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity at end. The amber sheet’s rule (“only releases in sculpted silence”) is taught early and paid off in the image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is lean and coherent: silence → flute → path → cavern → tear → other-side lesson → melodic stitch. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the boundary re-imagined as thread—visible in the smoothing of the tear and the released canyon hush. Orientation is swift; driftwood pattern is taught by 25 % mark. The −0.3 non-closure cap applies because the Protagonist makes no micro-choice under pressure; he plays the melody once told, so agency is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the workshop darkens, equations remain unsolved, and Elias’s silence carries undeniable conceptual cost—he is emptied of the very voices he stole. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-extinction, ink, and fragment hum build density until the final absence reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—topaz dome, letterpress, dying sky by line 3. One causal micro-gap: the fragment’s dissolution is not tethered to Elias’s agency, but the resonance of the darkened room suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ridgeway empty, pendant spent, air still humming—cost is felt. Causal chain is thin (mentor → pendant → stranger → inward turn) but coherent under Hybrid lens; the “germinate” beat supplies the single required tightening. Orientation is clean by line 5. No teleporting props, yet the relic’s rules remain vague; that vagueness is tolerated because the final image reweights meaning rather than resolving plot.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism warms, the arbor’s hum fades, and Elias exits carrying the shifted hush—cost is the surrender of empirical proof. Accumulative lens holds: frost pattern → prism light → quartz pulse → reweighted rule. Orientation is clear by line 5; causality intact, no teleporting props. One reflective block (mother memory) stays under 20 % and tilts present stance. Could reach 8+ if the final reconfiguration were forced through an on-page refusal that costs him something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forfeits the orchard and accepts the silence outside it. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (fraying shawl, glowing bead, skeleton loom) reweights the stake until the final crystallized poise. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the dimming amber and her forward step.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: dying orchards → mine-leach diagnosis → silk seal → dawn confirmation. Orientation is swift—floating orchards, blacksmith forge, azure haze all land inside 120 words. The closure beat (“a vein of azure defiance stitching the wound shut”) is a visible, irreversible change with felt bodily cost (ragged breath, night-long exertion). No lens ambiguity; causality holds start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city-of-mirrors image reweights the shard and the multiverse premise with undeniable ontological cost. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—accumulative thinning of reality plus the causal trigger of pressing shard-to-console—but the choice moment is off-page beat jump; we’re told “Kael made his decision” rather than shown the micro-choice that seals the gate.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias relights the lamp and abandons the talisman, crystallizing a communal custodianship that reweights his earlier solitude. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each note and stone accretes until the final pattern compels the act. The cost—relinquishing the sea glass—is on the page and irreversible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the overlapping handshake-reach reconfigures time’s loom and carries undeniable conceptual cost—she commits to birthing a city that will demand her disappearance. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens; each adjustment of the lantern tightens possibility because/therefore. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation (who, when) is taught in the first 120 words and pays off in the mirrored city reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map’s shimmer reweights the premise—stories cling iridescently—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early (sun trails = light paths) and returns in the glowing symbols, so the reconfiguration feels inevitable. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, yet legible: the dye master’s private quest becomes public, shareable light.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-forged sextant roots-map reweights the premise with felt cost (“so you don’t have to”). Causal chain holds—sextant → healing → map → stance shift—under Accumulative lens; one tight reflective block stays anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the first pale dawn appears and the realm “breathes again,” reconfiguring hope with the cost of Elara’s raw throat and the keeper’s dissolution. Causality is soft—singing is declared sufficient rather than tested in failure—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: pattern of seed-song-light accumulates and finally breaks the night. One transition (greenhouse → village) is clean; orientation is anchored by word 60. No meaningful tightening inside the middle beats keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: invitation → memory → map → exit, each step a because/therefore linkage that narrows options. The midnight clock supplies a hard external deadline, making the final stride a Decisive Change with felt cost—he abandons the library that defined him. Orientation is clean within 120 words; spatial anchors (narrow door, paradox shelf) are concrete. The reflective paragraph on the woman is the allowed 20 % and tilts present choice, so BRR is satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a gentle Conceptual Repricing: the seeds in soil re-weight the premise that absolution must be grown, not granted. Causality is soft—Elias is told, then complies—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds because the final image crystallizes the pattern of slow persistence. Cost is present but diffuse; the loaf is already consumed, so the price feels retrospective rather than a fresh forfeiture that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias locks the lantern, accepting lifelong custodianship with the cost of eternal solitude and labor. Causal chain is intact—finding slide → tuning frequencies → stabilizing illusion → choosing to preserve. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: “he knew what it could do” before on-page evidence, but it is quickly paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: false starts cue tension → overhear double-cross → intervene with heirloom → truce holds. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “fragile, stubborn hope” reweights earlier silence, cost felt in the still-warm fob. One scaffold loop (“the night itself had paused… the night itself had paused”) and a soft time-stamp delay the orientation anchor to ~140 words, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands as a Charged Poise: the trees march and Elara’s stance crystallizes with the compass spinning—cost is the irrevocable knowledge that she is “terrestrially cosmic.” Causal chain holds: ring warms → leads → encounter → reconfigures worldview; no teleporting information, no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dream→painting→door sequence supplies a coherent causal chain and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the laughter swells and Elias crosses. Cost is implied but not made visceral; the door opens because the story needs it, not because Elias’s prior choices have foreclosed any alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: plate fragment → map → archive → seam in floor → staircase, each because/therefore link tightening her options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits to descent with the map ink still on her fingers—cost is visible, path foreclosed. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each shard adds chromatic density until the final sapphire lattice reweights the stake. Orientation is swift (bluff, dusk, lone tuner). Closure lands as Charged Poise—colors flare, child may remember—cost is the stolen toy and accelerating melt. One transition (descent/ascent) is clean; pattern taught early via “symphonies are uncovered.”

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the controlled burn becomes self-burn, reweighting the premise from “save the roses” to “release the self.” Causal chain—magnetic shift → static swell → box ignition → dome crack—holds under the Accumulative lens; each beat intensifies texture rather than reverses plot. Cost is legible in the cracked dome and kneeling in ashes; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure beat—Clara reading the letter while Elara watches—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration that re-weights the locket and mailbox with felt cost, satisfying the lens (Accumulative/Textural). Causality is loose: the curator’s eavesdropping does not materially change the outcome, so the plot is more pattern-and-payoff than because-therefore. Still, the single deepening tightens the stake once and the image lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the six-one dice re-weight her life’s work, the vials’ glow makes the cost of owning the truth undeniable; causal chain (dice → coordinates → hatch → chamber) holds, and the lab’s slow collapse supplies a persistent constraint that shapes every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the choice to step into the gravity pocket reconfigures options and carries undeniable cost—he may never return. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: accumulative patterning (spiral, salt, echo) tightens until the causal leap into the chamber feels inevitable. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the paper dissolves, silence is re-weighted, cost is the loss of coded certainty—felt in the final “darkest light” image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet intensifies, then the bleed of ink breaks it, reconfiguring meaning. One causality gap: the prophecy’s content is withheld, so the stakes’ narrowing is abstract, not concrete; still, the lyric design lets the dissolve carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: seal discovery → rooftop habit → Mira’s appearance → mutual recognition → decision to listen. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s “hum” is re-weighted from private grief to shared legacy, cost legible in the word “finally.” Orientation is anchored within 120 words; rooftop, night, meteor shower all cue early. One minor causality gap: Mira’s identical seal feels convenient, but the text retrofits it as paternal inheritance, preserving credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarantine ends not by decree but by Elias accepting archival fusion with Liora, cost paid in the warming seashell and the garden’s flare. Causal chain holds: nightly visits → pattern recognition → sister’s archived form → joint departure. One soft spot: the government’s fear-of-weaponized-memory is revealed late and off-stage, so the external stakes feel retrofitted. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Causal, held to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: rose thorn → unlocks key → reveals scroll → collapses Vey’s lies. Orientation is swift—who, where, when land inside 70 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Lian exits the sanctuary, her name restored, Vey’s power fatally undercut. The mechanism is set up early (scholar’s key) and paid off on-page, though the scroll’s physical emergence is slightly rushed, keeping it just under the 9.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fused shell becomes a bridge and the couple cede their own voices to release the lost, a visible conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each station (merchant, storytellers, Veyan) layers density until the split object reweights the stake. The Orientation Test is waived: the nexus stays dreamlike yet legible, and the final image pays off the haze.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s decision to bury the truth is foreclosed by the prior accumulation of sabotage evidence and the red-coat apparition’s challenge, cost felt in the tear-like droplet. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each dream fragment tightens the pattern rather than causing a new external turn. Orientation is swift: who/where/when clear by line 5. No causal breaks; the sabotage revelation reweights earlier stakes without contradicting them.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: two figures poised on the parapet, life patterns re-weighted by companionship; the cost is the solitude Ren relinquishes, felt in the final hush. Causality is light—Mei’s arrival is externally triggered by her own whim, not Ren’s prior actions—so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal, but the image crystallizes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: shredded letters → stillpoint clue → diamond lens → revelation of healing orchard. Orientation is clean by word 90; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the diamond reveals the orchard is regenerative—so a before/after exists, but the cost is purely conceptual (government lies exposed); no personal price is levied on Elias. That softens the resonance; still, the lens stays causal and the turn is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crowd’s gaze pivots, Elias seizes the mantle, ancient shadows flare—cost is the lifelong solitude now weaponized. Causal chain is thin: the radio voice gives permission, but the crowd’s shift hinges on a spectral vision they somehow share without established rules, so the lens wobbles between causal and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—Elias re-names himself “translator” with felt social cost (no more exile, now responsibility to the child)—but the lens stays Accumulative; the final reweighting is legible yet leans on narrated summary rather than a decisive, on-page action that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: key sings → disruptor tactic → lighthouse counter → ice break → hand-in-water choice with visible cost. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no penalty. Closure is Earned Stasis: he keeps the guilt-bearing key, pulse now “quiet, steady,” cost legible in the still-shaking hand.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the joined gaze at glowing ice reconfigures the revolution from shout to tide, cost felt in the hush. Causality is sound—viaduct hum → stranger → shared stance—but the stranger’s appearance is pure arrival, not earned by Elias’s prior acts; the pivot therefore feels situational, not consequential to him alone.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the lantern re-ignites as Elias pivots from flight to resistance, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the heirloom from private talisman to public signal; cost is legible—once the evidence is sent, exposure is certain. Causal chain is tight: empirical pattern recognition → clandestine confirmation → irrevocable leak. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. The single micro-turn (extinguish → re-ignite) is sufficient for this length. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: discovery of heart → doubt → second opinion → resolve to prove innocence. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Elias steps into rain clutching the heart, abandoning safe absolution for uncertain justice. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (rising acid, stalled gears, arrow scrape) tightens the last possible moment to act. Closure is a Decisive Change—the bell’s groan stills the sea and invites an unseen respondent—cost is the workshop’s death and Elias’s exile-to-come. Orientation is anchored within 60 words by acid licking iron and kaleidoscope decoding. No plot amnesia; every object recurs with altered weight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: patch → numbers → hidden folder → video → choice. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (she picks a side), yet the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no supervisor walk-in, no alarm, no breath of consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lighthouse beam reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“reconstituted the light”). Causal chain holds—fragment → mirrors → path → beast → dissolution—though the mirrors’ rule-set is late-introduced and the village’s vulnerability is told, not tested, slightly blunting cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the death-tourist path by taking the volunteer list, cost legible in the parasol’s relocation from palm to coat lining. Accumulative lens holds: each breath-rattle, frost cue, and object reprise thickens the texture until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hand-brush reconfigures their stance with the felt cost of past hurt still unerased. Causal lens holds—because the letter arrived, she waited; because he arrives after the last bus, reconciliation becomes the only live option. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden thread image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—“to preserve is to let it pass unfiltered.” Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (pavilion murmurs, parapet pulse, thread) tightens the stake until the final crystallization. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation is taught early and pays off in the peripheral-vision climax.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fresh photo placed at the center reweights the arc from private salvage to shared offering, and the cost is the recognition that “creating” is itself the masterpiece—an earned foreclosing of his former spectator stance. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photograph adds density until the self-taken image crystallizes meaning. One minor scaffold—three iterative “how the…” clauses—slows the final cadence but does not blunt the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gardens are “remembering,” re-weighting the world-rule with visible conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each crystal interaction layers density until the final pattern break. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt applied. One minor soft spot: the “testify” stake is declared early but not dramatized as an external imperative, so the cost feels intellectual rather than relational.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tape re-inscribes the spiral rule and reweights the premise—he can now “listen” because the cost of forgetting is visible in his own handwriting. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each return deposits artifacts (chalk, tape, driftwood) whose density finally crystallizes into Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored early; driftwood choreography stays coherent. One minor causality bump: the VCR “somewhere” powers itself, a tiny teleport, but it doesn’t resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the photograph burns through paper as the observatory falls, reconfiguring Elias’s life at undeniable cost. Causal chain holds: cracked lens → impossible image → clock-hand graft → infinite exposure → physical proof → station collapse → escape with relic. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no penalty. One minor causality bump: “dying breath” stabilizers are declared, never shown to worsen by his tampering—keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two jagged vinyl fragments meet in Elias’s pocket, reweighting the premise that broken things still hold music—cost is felt in the fading light and Lena’s slowing breath. Causal linkage is clean: because she asks, he sings; because she hands him the second shard, he accepts the custodial burden. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“radiant haven above the clouds”) and never drifts. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: key discovery → journal clue → descent → mirror revelation → key-turn → shadow return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: shadows re-enter the world, reweighting reality; cost is cosmological, not personal. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The “because” links tighten once; sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine is clean: tooth → map → maze → living child, each step a direct consequence of the last, and the final image (“Together, they walked back…”) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with the conceptual cost that the town will remain ignorant. Orientation is swift (garden, hedge maze, night after the body) and the lens—Causal—is held without wobble. The only minor slack is the off-stage appearance of the silver map; while magical, it is foreshadowed by the glowing second tooth, so causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of mirrored light builds to Charged Poise closure when the pearl’s glow refracts through her. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (grotto → village) is legible. Cost is conceptual—she must hold still, not burn—but felt in the hush that spreads over the crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant returned to the rack crystallizes a new shared silence-with-cost. Causal chain is lean but intact—Mira steals pendant → Elias tracks her → mutual offering → pendant left as joint monument. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single-scene default met. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (drips, cracks, amber glow) tightens once and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias turns back, accepting that hopes must pass through him, the river’s resistance now a persistent constraint—cost is felt. Causality is Accumulative: each apparition layers density until the protagonist’s accusation breaks the pattern. Early spatial anchors (river-bend, mist) arrive by word 80, well inside the 120-word safety window, so Orientation Test is waived. One minor lapse: the rules of “collecting shapes” are never demonstrated as an action, only asserted, blunting the final reconfiguration slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the arbor’s golden glow and the tendril’s pulse reconfigure the village’s disbelief into potential communal song—visible, felt cost is the energy drained from Liora and the arbor’s withheld hush afterward. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory intensification (tendril pulse, bark glow) is a pattern break that reweights the stake of forgotten belief without requiring external antagonist turns.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the hovering paper-jar starlight reweights the premise—he can seal, not destroy—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: because he envies the ink’s stillness, therefore he folds absence, ignites, and creates a counter-ash stillness inside himself. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the shift from burning memories to sealing the pause. Cost is legible in the final image—“the stillness between his own heartbeats.”

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the timer reverses, Elias realizes harvest = release, and the cost is the surrender of control he spent months refining—felt in the heartbeat-synced tick. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern (light study → quartz lever → reflection avatar → backward spin) is legible and tightens once. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only drag is a mild soft-reset: the cavern fills with convenient firefly-echo light that cushions the epiphany rather than leaving Elias in literal darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp-warmed burner and the song-drip reweight the prior hush with undeniable cost (“her body lighter”) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds because each calcified burden dissolves only after she permits it to press skin-cold against her, a micro-choice chain that tightens once and releases. Orientation is swift—grotto, starlight, snowmelt drip by line 3—so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crouched lion reweights the stake from “contain grief” to “hold companion grief,” with felt cost in the warmed wood under her fingers. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of steam, rain, blade, wood accumulates density until the cadence shifts at “rust-hued peace.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Persistent constraint—the blank’s patient existence—shapes every tactical delay.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wheel’s silent drop reweights the premise—she forfeits the last relic of her past self. Causality holds under Accumulative lens; each fragmentary overheard story layers until the ghost’s single line crystallizes the cost of endless deferral. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. The only slack is the ghost’s exit—dissolving rather than forcing a tangible last refusal—keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sextant warms, the terminal becomes “a beginning,” and the cost (she leaves with responsibility instead of mere assessment) is legible in the final image; causal chain holds—find object → follow water → meet caretaker → inherit mandate—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that reweights hope from decay to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias re-opens the path to the foreclock with felt cost—he abandons lifelong avoidance and the safety of routine. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the humming stones, ticking Spire, and music-box melody layer until the final kneel reweights memory. Causality is soft—why a bear guides him is unexplained—but coincidence only complicates, not resolves, so Situational allowance holds. Orientation debt is waived: “the city of Vaelis still slept” places us by 60 words and the bear’s payoff at closure justifies early hush-mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s re-pointing and the mirrored self-image reweight every prior search under a Conceptual Repricing—his quarry was never external. Causality holds: because he boards, therefore he sees; because he sees, the compass flips. Orientation is clean by 120 words; the twilight canal, barge, and lone seeker are anchored. One micro-turn—needle swinging off-cardinal—tightens the entire quest. Cost is legible in the final line: the tool he trusted now indicts him.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decoded name “Weeping Shoals” reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the world is wider and more dangerous than preservation alone). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each knot thickens pattern density until the threshold is legible—yet the rope’s uniqueness is asserted rather than tested, keeping the beat just shy of decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief-density increases until the final Charged Poise. Anchors are clear within 120 words; orientation test waived. Closure is valid—she presses the thread into soil, crystallizing her perpetual self-burial—but the cost is conceptually rather than viscerally felt. One causal gap: the thread’s leap from memento to suture is asserted, not dramatized, slightly dulling the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s slow unfurling reweights the premise—beauty is not assembled but remembered—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Persistent constraint (palace chains, cracked lute, broken voice) shapes every tactic; cost is legible in the final image of damp wings leaning into his touch. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the adult offers her scar-song to the child while the distant siren keeps the fire-world alive; the new dyad is legible and irreversible. Causality is situational—no plot reversals, but the encounter crystallizes Lena’s stance under the lagoon’s hush. Orientation is swift; only the mother’s vanishing remains off-stage without payoff, a minor ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: box → key → date → breadcrumbs → apparition → lock → staircase, each beat tightening options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—staircase into light reweights “sidereal patience” with cost of irreversible descent. One transition (surface → under-city) is legible; no orientation debt. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nebula’s lingering light reconfigures the cycle without guaranteeing victory; cost is the powered-down warship and Kael’s wordless swallow. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore linked to the gear activation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“viewport”) and never breaks. One persistent constraint remains: the gear is now spent/still, a price that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ribbon-banner over the greenhouse door reconfigures grief from private weight to shared pattern, cost felt in the public recitation. Causal chain holds: ribbon → poem → greenhouse walks → insight → communal act. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The only slack is the off-stage “weeks” ellipsis that skips the beat where Elias decides to speak the poem aloud—without it, the final gesture feels slightly gifted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: pendulum hesitation → discovery of forgotten sins → physical transference → restored swing, each beat a because/therefore step. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the closure image—“the pendulum’s swing was no longer a pause—it was a promise”—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the bob now permanently carries the names). No teleporting props or causal gaps; the rake’s reappearance is set up early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each thread-color discovery layers density until the gold initials reprice Elias’s custodial life. Closure is a Charged Poise—roses tomorrow, echoes tonight—whose conceptual cost (he will now tend the living memory, not just the dead) is legible in the final image. No orientation debt; transitions from silo to river and back are cleanly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the written future reconfigures the scholars’ certainty with visible cost—the ink still wet, the chamber warmed by spent possibility. Causal lens holds: because she writes, the world’s rule-set shifts. Orientation is swift; the spire, lake, and task are anchored by line 3. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust speaks “Listen,” crystallizing Elias’s new role and foreclosing the old silence. Causality holds—radio lyric → dust jar → spoken word—each step triggered by an on-page choice. The final image carries visible cost: the radio fades to static, leaving him alone with the glowing dust, a charged poise that reweights the premise. One minor scaffold: “He had what he needed” could be cut without loss, but it does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative pattern (chair warmth → mask vision → portrait resolving into self) tightens once and lands a resonant reconfiguration: the gallery’s vanishing point collapses into Elias’s own face, costing him the comfort of external quest. Orientation is swift; the lens holds. Only the toss-away of the mask in the final line slightly dilutes the price by externalizing it into city indifference rather than body memory.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias chooses to leave the sewer, re-weighting his isolation versus civic duty. Causality is clean—cog study → sediment timeline → decision—but the pivot from private obsession to public action happens in one expository line (“he would take his findings to the surface”). No intermediate beat tests or narrows his options, so the tightening is only conceptual; cost is implied, not dramatized. Accumulative lens holds, yet the final image lacks a palpable constraint or price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stilled wind and joined hands reconfigure meaning with felt cost under an Accumulative lens. The zither’s pattern is taught early and returns to crystallize the shift; silence replaces discord. Orientation is clean within 60 words. One soft spot: the “unlearning” turn is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible beat, keeping the causality just shy of 9+ tension.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pouch of seeds crystallizes a new, uncertain path after the memory-fruit reweights her pain; causal chain holds—alignment window → plant → bite → softened grief → dispersal—with one clean transition inside the greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain holds: found box → riddle → Maren intercepts → tower core → blue match reignites hives. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s wonder is restored yet the tower is now depleted, a felt cost legible in “stolen thunder.” Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor slack: the saboteur is named but never faces consequence, so the plot stops at restoration rather than full reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the house’s resumed, heavier breath reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—no prior beat shows Elias intending to “pause” rather than cleanse—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the final image crystallizes the pattern of listening silence. Orientation is swift; bay, dock, lane anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she believes the ampoule is a cure, therefore she shatters it, releasing the contained shame. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the garden becomes confession, her mission inverted, cost legible in the violet tendrils now coiling through ruins. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the “structural weakness” is named only at the 75 % mark, but it is still causally threaded into the final act, so the beat tightens rather than breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tilted staircase reweights the premise—“even in infinity, there is room for change”—with visible conceptual cost. Causality holds: the chipped die’s null result → tremor → tilt. Orientation is swift; the infinite rule is taught by line 5. The rupture is summarized rather than moment-by-moment, muting the decisive beat, but the lens (Causal) remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rolled-up portraits propped around the city crystallize her stance and reconfigure meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric—each stroke adds density until the final distribution act reframes the stake—cost is felt in her ink-smudged fingers and the moonlit exhaustion she embraces. Orientation anchors within the first 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices at this length. High-band gate met; only the gentle scale of cost keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: bees return, tapestry re-weaves, cost is conceptual (heritage may survive) and felt. Causal chain is thin—bread shape → bee summoning is magical coincidence—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) accepts pattern-break reweighting, so the image satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: yoyo-rise → stone-split → time-reverse → blank stone, each beat caused by the last. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam now casts *backward*, a visible, conceptual cost that reweights the premise. One causal gap—why the yoyo first rises—is never seeded, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive disorientation; the final image pays off the inversion rule cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s reversion and torn photo certify a before/after under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—why touching glass starves the doppelgänger is asserted, not motivated—but the pattern holds. Orientation is clean by 120 words; only one reflective block (<20 %) and it tilts present stance. Cost is conceptual (loss of cursed image) rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky resonates back, cost is the irreversible exposure of his private ritual to the vast sea; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies rather than causally reverses. Orientation is swift; only driftwood-raft physics stays fuzzy, not enough to dent legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: crack → descent → revelation → flight, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change—she abandons land for sea—paid for by the visceral sight of the changed explorers; cost is on-page (“did not stop… did not look back”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. One causal bump: the whistle set-up never recurs to alter tactics, a minor unkept gun.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: rose drops → board lifted → rival appears → joint decision → letter redirected. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “lie” keeps breathing but under a glass that also shows the truth, reweighting the rule-set for future viewers. Cost is legible in the final image—“bare branches stark against the twilight” signals winter for the old story. One minor causality fuzz: the private-collector solution is introduced only in the last paragraph, so the tactical path feels lightly teleported in.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the empty inkwell and last line reweight the premise—preservation is now shared underwater breath. Causal linkage holds: each note found → compels written response → empties inkwell → redefines self as “keeper of echoes.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the final image (“clutched the empty inkwell”).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamp becomes ancestral key, re-indexing his life. Causal chain is thin—ledger coincidence supplies the crucial name without prior tension or jeopardy. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual (inheritance revealed) but not felt; the blackout lifting is external grace, not causal price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dream she polished now owns her, flipping artisan into vessel under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The basilica, garden, and lantern craft are anchored by word 80; no orientation debt. Causality is clean—each lantern tightens the pattern until the inevitable rupture—and the final image (“the world transformed”) carries undeniable cost. One hairline slip: the priests’ offerings appear without prior mention, a micro-teleport that keeps this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the geode’s searing pulse and the decision to re-enter the wreckage reweight the stake—she chooses to weaponize grief rather than escape it—visible cost is the blistering palm. Causal chain holds: geode hum → ghost solidifies → system reboot → flight back into fire, each beat tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“rusted girders,” “central chamber,” “circuit breakers below her feet”). One minor lapse: “the logs” are cited without prior on-page cue, but the ghost’s flicker immediately pays it off, so causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the observatory darkens, the call persists, and Elias’s assent carries felt opportunity-cost. Causal chain is thin—chip + drone + star trail → revelation → assent—but it holds. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity. The beat-by-beat linkage is mostly “and-then,” yet the final image reweights earlier motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because Elias falsifies pedigrees, he recognizes forged history in Liora’s file; because he combs driftwood he finds the carved spiral; because he finds it, the uncle must confess. Closure is a decisive change—snapping the hour-hand forecloses the alibi of frozen grief and commits him to pursuit—cost is visible in the broken brass. Orientation anchored by 70 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the parapet, moon, mist, and objects layer density until the final image reweights “recycling mistakes” as an unending personal burden rather than societal fix. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: the widening space between Elias and Seris, plus the double weight in his pocket, forecloses retreat into pure detachment while making the cost legible. One tightening—accepting both keepsakes—suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass-toss reweights every prior beat under an Accumulative/Textural lens and carries visible emotional cost. Orientation is clean by 60 words; the single shard holds pattern to the golden light payoff. One causal micro-turn—poles as mock guideposts → accepted markers → rejected lifeline—tightens stakes once, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: baseball signature → lake → labyrinth → mirror → forced self-confrontation, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he looks, option space reweights, cost is the unerasable memory now consciously carried. Orientation is clean by 120 words; only one reflective block exceeds 20 %, but it is anchored and tilted by the on-page micro-choice of gripping the ball.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: fortune warning → spice ritual → apparition → reluctant metamorphosis → acceptance, each step tightening the impossible return. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the great bird’s eyes still his, the orchard sighing, options reconfigured with the visible cost of bodily intangibility. The lens is Causal; every beat is a “because” that forecloses the old bond. A hairline slip: the phoenix’s pyre is mentioned but never anchored in scene time, so the rule-shift feels slightly imported rather than witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: ink-sealed handprint fuses past and present under a parting cloud ceiling, cost legible in the irreversible stain. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ship dissolves, the locket is empty, and Liora floats lighter—an undeniable before/after. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern (each photograph stitched → ship unravels into light) is taught early and holds. Orientation is swift: recycled ship, last pacifist, locked dimension, all inside 50 words. The only slip is the late claim “she wasn’t the one who needed to enter”—a motivational retro-patch that slightly blurs agency.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the darkened jar and volcanic cough crystallize a new necessity, cost is felt (“he didn’t feel destitute. He felt necessary”). Causal lens holds: detour→woman→mirror→run, each because/therefore link narrowing options. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Minor knock: prophecy supplies external causality rather than Elias’s prior tactics triggering the eruption, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → aide plants note → Mira intercepts → torch signal sparks revolt. Orientation lands within 60 words; no penalty. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her torch left behind crystallizes the irreversible shift from guardian to insurgent. The cost is legible in the final image: fort glow at her back, city silence ahead, world holding breath.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: friction returns re-weighted, the world’s texture restored at visible price (“the weight in his chest lighter now”). Causality under the Accumulative lens holds—each rock placement tightens the pattern until star-dust and eel-shard complete the weave. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Elias had spent thirty-seven years…”). The only hairline slip: the father’s deathbed line is told rather than shown, a micro-ellipse that keeps it from perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is not decoded but pocketed, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (“some maps were never meant to be read, only carried”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, timer, photograph layer until the final lightning flash reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; causality is intact, though the tightening beat is single and interior.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the card-sundial alignment reconfigures their duel into joint journey with conceptual cost (“the duel was over. The journey had just begun”). Causal chain holds: card reveal → angle shift → stance reversal. Orientation clean by 120 words. No meaningful constraint persists into the after-image, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library breathes, the key’s purpose is fulfilled, and Lumen’s refusal to name himself yet feels like forward motion; causal chain holds—key → library → resistance shelf—though the prison-to-street ellipsis leaves one minor kink in linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arbor, crowd, ocean and clock all reconfigure in one image whose cost is the surrender of Elias’s protected stasis. Causal chain holds—film discovery → loophole plan → horizon rule → encore → storm → clock restart—each beat tightening options under a causal lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 5 and reinforced by compass chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is linked by “because/therefore” (monsoon → memory loss → must plant → seed sprouts → knowledge reweights future). Closure is a Decisive Change: the island’s pact is exposed and Liora’s stance flips from passive guardian to active speaker; the vine bracelet is a persistent constraint. Orientation is clean within 60 words. No teleporting props or retro-patches. One micro-turn (seed crack → pages) tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thread snipped from regret-diffusion lace and woven into the bonsai reweights the premise—regret becomes material he can redistribute, not erase. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the compass-plus-lace path is taught early and returns to crystallize options. Cost is conceptual but legible: the severance remains, yet its weight is now portable. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens contradiction at end.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara chooses to remain in the broken greenhouse, accepting decay as data. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—dust patterns intensify from debris to “map” to “constellations,” reweighting insignificance into meaning. Cost is legible in warped notebook pages and damp wood: she sacrifices institutional validation for unglamorous witness. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; flood aftermath tightens options without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s decision crystallizes options—protect herself or expose the conspiracy—with frost-weighted cost felt in her pocket. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns + ledger numbers coalesce into understanding. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. Cost is legible in “the weight of it steady against her thigh”—a quiet but irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory and emotional density until the climax reweights silence from void to canvas. Orientation is immediate: winterglass conservatory, post-capsizing Elias, clear stakes by line 3. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—silence gains language via heat-mapped color—charged by the irreversible loss of hearing. Cost is legible in the final image: he “hears” only through translation, not restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker accepts his role as keeper, foreclosing a life of surface-world detachment with visible cost (his trembling ceases only through surrender to purpose). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—fractured light, humming lenses, and salt-preserved books layer into a resonant whole. Every beat tightens toward the library’s call; even the opening tremor refracts forward. The logbook’s final line crystallizes stakes without over-explaining, and the water-parting moment pays off early spatial cues cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring objects, gestures, and silence. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the two bells resting together crystallize a stance—endurance through memory—that reconfigures the community’s relationship to absence and hope. Cost is legible in the trembling hands, tightened sanctions, and dangerous patrols; the final image carries conceptual weight without explicit statement. Pattern is taught early (arbor as sanctuary) and pays off cohesively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: unused love isn’t hoarded but passed on, reweighting the entire premise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the density of breath/fog/spark imagery intensifies until the boy’s healing crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in Lien’s relinquishment and the father’s burden lifting. Orientation is immediate (“viaduct,” “Lien,” “twilight”), and the single scene holds pressure cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara forecloses her own temporal innocence to heal fractured history, crystallized in the line “She had touched the texture of time, and it had touched her back.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring motifs (photographs, vines, halos) that reconfigure meaning at the end. Cost is legible in her aged body and vanished fragment. Orientation is immediate (“The hedge maze designer…”) and disorientation serves closure (the street as trapped moment).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vault’s purpose shifts from hiding to seeding, reweighting all prior stakes with undeniable social cost (“people who had given up on green things”). The inferred Causal lens holds—each key unlocks a narrowing path, culminating in the decisive act of locking the vault behind them. The wall’s collapse functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence. Cost is legible in Mira’s breath hitching and the chains growing “lighter” with hope’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias accepts an imperfect imprint, reconfiguring his grandfather’s quest from madness to meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds sensory density (colors-as-sound, shipwrecks, aurora) until the final image crystallizes stakes. Cost is legible in “the cancer in his bones was still a whisper” and the crumbling paper—time and truth are running out. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via sensory density (moonbeams, flowers, emerald tiles) until the jar’s glow and Kael’s rose reconfigure meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—they forego the train to build “their own track,” with visible cost (abandoning departure) and conceptual repricing (destiny as co-creation). Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact through symbolic logic. The final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias crystallizes his stance—ready to shape anew—with the control room humming to life and ice melting outside. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, validated by the deepening density of sensory and symbolic detail that reweights his central stake: crafting safe zones for inquiry. Cost is legible in the unfinished orb, abandoned studio, and years of isolation. Orientation is clear by line 2; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s stance shifts from fear-driven evasion to collaborative truth-seeking, with visible cost—the shattering of identity now remade through shared history. The drive lens is Causal: each beat follows because/therefore logic (letter → diary → library → shell → cast → box → photo). Orientation is immediate (“rusted library,” “Mira”), and the photograph’s revelation retroactively validates prior tension. Cost is legible in the caretaker’s choked sound and Mira’s unflinching gaze—their past silence now replaced by fragile reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the oracle forecloses interpretation in favor of silence, with visible cost (the disintegrated booklet, the relinquished need to speak). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens via sensory density (pebbles, gold leaf, storm hush) until the final cadence shift reweights silence as fullness. Orientation anchors immediately (“ridge fort,” “oracle,” “pebble shore”), and the single shard structure fits scope. Cost is legible in the misting breath, shedding weight, and tide carrying away dust.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: E-7X reconfigures his purpose without resolving the central mystery, cost legible in his slower, deliberate movements. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the loops layer sensation until the violin “sings,” collapsing repetition into insight. Orientation is clear by line 2; the ice-violin’s late appearance is functional, not coincidental, as it catalyzes the closure. Cost is felt in forfeited certainty for pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens returned, silence reconfigured from barrier to beginning, with conceptual cost (years of mutual mistrust now acknowledged). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via density of ticket stubs, doodles as map, rain-washed lies—culminating in a cadence shift toward openness. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the final image: “the silence between them didn’t feel like a barrier. It felt like a beginning.”

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias accepts he cannot control the garden, only tend it—a stance crystallized when he leaves the marbles behind. The cost is legible in his withered body and the maze’s decay, and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: pressure builds through patterned exchanges (marbles ↔ blooms) until the seedling reweights everything. The Orientation Test is waived—the disorientation mirrors Elias’s own—and the causal chain remains intact through ritual reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara reweights reality by proving time moves sideways, with undeniable conceptual cost (“live with the weight of it”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through bioluminescent pulses, wing hums, and holographic ripples until the nexus collapse. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“Dr. Elara Vey… station’s obliging sky mechanic”), and the final image crystallizes options without tidy resolution. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the AI’s demand.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena’s act of playing reconfigures silence into music, the past into presence, with clear conceptual cost—the program blanks, Elias vanishes, and she stands alone in irreversible knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sensory density (water, lanterns, ink) intensifies until the violin note shatters stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images of water, light, and glass until the final Conceptual Repricing crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate and precise; closure lands as a Charged Poise where Elias’s understanding reconfigures his relationship to his craft, with the cost implied in decades of unseeing labor. The stone-throwing ritual provides structural symmetry without mechanical repetition. Every beat tightens the thematic coil, culminating in a resonant, legible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (fire, silence, scarring) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: rewriting the bargain reconfigures meaning without resolving the past. Cost is legible in the silver throat scar and Elias’s softened grief—felt, not explained. The porcelain box’s discovery initiates a deepening, not a causal chain, but the escalation of emotional stakes tightens coherently toward the final image of ink bleeding like water through cracked earth.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of shells, tides, and timelines accumulate until the gauge’s movement reweights everything. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the gauge transforms from relic to bridge—and carries conceptual cost (hope as measurable force). The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (“another timeline”) pays off in the CR. A persistent constraint (the grotto’s liminal thinness) shapes tactics, and the final image (“work had only just begun”) crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing—walls remember, and forgetting has cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; closure lands via Charged Poise (Elias hovering over the map, walls humming in anticipation). The cost—being “consumed” by legacy—is legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening (diaries → map → woman’s revelation) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering, recurring motifs (prism, lullabies, heartbeat), and cadence shifts that culminate in the mirage’s crystallization at the bell’s chime. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Liora doesn’t enter the city, but her belief reconfigures possibility itself, with the cost legible in her isolation and the watchman’s inability to see what she sees. Orientation is immediate (“terrace,” “afternoon’s last rain,” “Liora”), and the single scene tightens meaningfully when the bells ring—narrowing the window of grace and forcing decisive action. The final image—brush moving, lullabies humming, heartbeat steady—makes the before/after undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: coherent pressure (ritual setting, celestial timing, personal history) forces stance crystallization without causal chain dependency. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image of walking toward the altar reconfigures their relationship with undeniable cost (“the price of redemption was high, but so was the cost of walking away”). The cost is legible in Liora’s exhaustion and Kessar’s coin-gift, which symbolizes irrevocable commitment. Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias reweights the premise by choosing ecological restoration over preservation through sterility, making the echo live in returning life rather than static silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (thunder, salt, egg’s warmth) until the final act crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final image: “Let the world forget him” signals personal erasure as price for resonance. Orientation is immediate and never falters; causality is motivated by consistent interior logic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered echoes and symbolic threads. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Liora redefines conformity as enforced silence, and her act of listening becomes defiance. Cost is legible in the “hollow places” filled by others’ voices—she trades isolation for inherited courage. The prism sanctuary’s mechanics are consistent, and the final image of her walking lighter crystallizes Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, recurring symbols (bird, stick, dome), and rhythmic cadence build toward a Conceptual Repricing—stories as living, destabilizing forces. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Liora’s candle-lit recitation crystallizes her stance, and the softened return of light signals irreversible commitment. Cost is legible in the brother’s off-page rejection and the dome’s hollow acoustics—spaces once for surveillance now repurposed for fragile truth. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s realization that “the signal had been sent” crystallizes options (acceptance over rescue) with undeniable conceptual cost—the monarchs’ likely extinction. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds via layered signals (stones, reeds), culminating in the monarchs’ arrival and departure. Cost is legible in the final image: “the stones would fall, the reeds would rot,” yet meaning persists. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sensory detail and patterned recurrence (aurora, rope, names). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias doesn’t resurrect the dead but reconfigures their absence into presence via the rope’s hum—a Charged Poise where cost (years of silence, irreversible loss) is felt in every vibration. The inciting incident (finding the card) and climax (unspooling the rope) are causally linked through ritual action, not plot mechanics, and the aurora’s final shimmer validates the shift without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the directive’s true meaning shifts from preservation to continual choice, reweighting every prior image of decay as active participation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (vines, seals, paths) until the final beat crystallizes their meaning with cost (the walker endures while the path decays). Orientation is clear by line 3 (“vine-draped bunker,” “Elias”), and the dream sequence functions as a taught shard that pays off in the oak-door revelation. Cost is legible in the warm key—a symbol of responsibility, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the star-mirror reveals the palace’s future restoration, reweighting Nabu-sharru’s act from failed divination to cultural stewardship. Cost is legible in the final image—the mercenaries’ intrusion, his solitary kneeling, the “unremarkable shard”—and the Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural, with escalating sensory density (myrrh → pulsing tile → liquid silver → dawn-light) culminating in a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality remains intact as every beat flows from his goal. The lens holds coherently through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sanctuary stills, the pin glows, and both characters choose release over retribution, with visible emotional cost. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural + Causal)—pressure builds through sensory density and bodily memory, culminating in a decisive shift. The sanctuary’s magic functions consistently, and the music box’s restoration ties directly to thematic payoff. One flaw: Veyra’s amnesia risks feeling like a narrative shortcut, though it serves the sanctuary’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dream is held, not captured, reconfiguring the premise of boundaries. Cost is legible—the mirror maker’s lifelong isolation ends only through vulnerability, not control. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, frost, glass, and breath patterns intensify toward a cadence shift at the summit. Every beat links via sensory and rhythmic escalation, not causality, yet pressure tightens unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orchard imagery, ribbon, and quartz pendant accrue meaning through selective repetition, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where safety is redefined as self-possession. Orientation is immediate (“cathedral’s vaulted ceiling… surrendered to the orchard”), and closure lands via Charged Poise—the repaired pendant scarred but functional, the peach warm, the vow deciduous yet persistent. Cost is legible in Liora’s tightened chest and the girl’s faltering voice; no causal breaks or amnesia. The final image reweights all prior material without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shell isn’t blank but waiting, reweighting the orchard from record of past to ledger of possibilities. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory echoes (starlight, hum, water) until the bath triggers a pattern break that crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the predecessor’s silence and the curator’s acceptance of unrecordable knowledge. Orientation is clear by line 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the door opens to reveal the sister, reconfiguring the library from abstract myth to personal crucible, with palpable cost in Elara’s breath catching and the time traveler’s shock. The Causal lens holds—each move follows from prior choices (renegotiation, diary navigation). Orientation is immediate (“mountain,” “bookstore,” “Elara Vey”). One flaw: the sister’s transformation isn’t foreshadowed enough to fully earn the emotional pivot without a slight causality stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with memory, fog, and recurring motifs tightening pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing: the Garden redefines identity as something that dissolves rather than returns. The closure—Elias and Liora swallowed by fog—is a Charged Poise: options crystallize (stay or vanish), cost is felt (permanent loss of certainty), and the emerald swatch’s reweaving seals the thematic turn. Orientation is immediate and maintained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Liora reframes archival duty from preservation to restitution, reweighting the university’s sanctioned history with undeniable social cost.

Cost is legible in the final image: the vanished door confirms truth-telling carries existential risk. Orientation is immediate (“university’s clock tower,” “archivist”), and the two-shard structure (present → past → present) tightens pressure without disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ryn doesn’t find permanent quiet but secures portable silence, reconfiguring her mission with tangible cost—the bloom’s destruction and the beings’ intensified hum. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to a cadence shift at the bloom’s collapse. Orientation is immediate (“harmonic caves,” “Ryn, the ripple-mark mapkeeper”), and causality flows via because/therefore linkages (stone vibrates → passage revealed → bloom touched → beings react). Cost is legible in the final image: “the stone pulsed… dimming but steady”—silence preserved but diminished.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world’s brokenness isn’t terminal—the last beacon pulses, reweighting Elias’s lifelong vigil into active hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: sensory motifs (hum, light, silence) intensify until the prism refracts them into revelation. Cost is legible in the pavilion’s softening hum—a farewell—and Elias’s irreversible departure.

No causality breaks; every image accrues toward the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Veyra assumes the throne not as ruler but heir, with the cost being immediate responsibility under a ticking dawn clock. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via layered murals, shifting images, and the ruby flake’s evolution—culminating in a reconfiguration of what the throne means. Causality holds: each action (stepping through veil, scraping bark, descending stairs) triggers the next revelation. The “wisely adventurous” ethos is dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the threshold is no longer a barrier but a choice, and the keeper’s act of connection reconfigures her isolation with palpable cost—her own lungs expand “as if for the first time in years,” implying years of suffocation.

No causality breaks; pressure tightens once via the drone-triggered freeze, which the terrarium ritual resolves without convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias awakens to a reconfigured library and draws “the shape of the ache,” crystallizing his stance with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density and spatial contraction until the walls close in, forcing transformation. Cost is legible in the erased portrait and rewritten cards. Orientation is immediate: lighthouse, fog, abandoned library—all anchor within 40 words and serve the closure’s symbolic rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s vow to track the time-thieves reconfigures his stance with legible stakes and conceptual cost (“They’re taking the time”). The drive lens is Causal—each beat follows because/therefore logic from eclipse to drone to ink-as-stolen-time. Orientation is clear by line 3; the single scene holds spatial coherence. Only minor deduction: the ink’s sentience resolves the crisis without Elias earning it through prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias plants the letter, crystallizing his stance against enforced silence, with the library’s sigh and accelerating snow signaling irreversible consequence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds pressure through sensory density (ozone-scented paper, humming machinery, leaning shelves) until the final image reweights “preservation” as active dissent. Cost is legible in “the letter felt heavier now, its weight not just in paper but in consequence.” Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite minimal action because thematic escalation substitutes for plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through recurring images (sandbag scrap, initials, roses) that deepen in resonance. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: Liora renounces flight or fight, choosing rooted endurance while her father abandons the bounty—foreclosing a path with visible cost (his hesitation, the wilting bloom). The “tower fell” backstory is economically anchored early and paid off in present behavior; orientation is clear by line 30. Cost is legible in the final image: the bounty remains unclaimed, his fleet grounded, her life sustained in fragile defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: celestial disorder disrupts the garden’s harmony, which in turn reveals the echo—a pattern break that reweights the entire sensory field. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael voices silence, stars halt, and the world exhales—but the cost is legible in what’s unsaid: he remains alone, the goddess still distant. The rail spike’s warmth signals transformation without resolution. Every beat tightens around sensory dissonance resolving into singular note.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara steps into light, armed with letters and nib, crystallizing her stance against erasure. The causal lens holds—each action follows from prior knowledge (intact nib, scrubbed archives). Cost is legible: she risks exposure, sanity, life. The observatory-clock midpoint anchors time, and the “shovel” demand tightens stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias stops running by stitching the past into his body, foreclosing escape with permanent cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds dissonant voices until the tattoo ritual reweights their frequency into murmur. Cost is legible in the cold amber, hollow-eyed faces on screens, and the irreversible act of self-marking. Orientation is clear by line 3; no ambiguity or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (tile flakes, mandala shifts, lilac mist) until the pattern break—mandala lines glowing—reweights everything. Orientation is immediate (“chalk artist… whispering grotto”), and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the grotto’s emergent hush isn’t silence but collective memory, redefining the town’s unlearning as repression. Cost is legible in Liora’s clenched stomach, trembling hands, and the town’s “quiet ache.” No causality breaks; every beat tightens thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora’s decision crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with the mosaic’s reassembly reweighting memory and mercy. Cost is legible in her blood-drawn palm and the irreversible act of embedding lapis where a name once was. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (retrocognition) pays off at closure. The inferred lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds consistently, with pattern intensification (mosaic → name → redefinition) driving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure), with the fractured timeline functioning as both texture and causal mechanism. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“Elias,” “orchard,” “after tourists leave”). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora takes Elias’s hand amid overlapping temporal echoes, crystallizing stakes (dance again vs. remain ghost) with palpable emotional cost. The tarot coin’s activation directly enables the climax without retroactive rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s final “Prove it” reconfigures her skepticism into belief-within-risk, crystallizing options under Accumulative/Textural lens. The static shock anchors time, place, and POV by line 3; disorientation serves closure by mirroring neural rewiring. Cost is legible in the fading memory (“It wasn’t mine”) and the irreversible act of painting air-born threads. One meaningful deepening—the shift from skin to atmosphere—narrows her path from reversal to integration.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Eira’s transformation reconfigures her role from observer to translator, with felt cost (loss of self, shattered device). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (bioluminescence, heat-mapping colors) until the cave “swallows her whole.” Orientation is immediate (“last human city,” “coastal cave”), and the fissure’s deliberate parting pays off early disorientation. Cost is legible in the warm fossil and storm-scented air—she now carries the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is established early and held flawlessly: each button adds density until the pattern break—the silver last button—triggers upward-flowing sand. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: prophecies aren’t fulfilled but spun anew, with cost legible in Mira’s relinquishment of linear time. The canyon echo’s final note crystallizes this reweighting without exposition. Every beat tightens around the central act of unscrambling truth through lost things.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “fixing what’s broken” reweights into “carrying forward,” crystallized by Elias pocketing the file and leaving the pillbox. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the snow codes, key, and desk materials layer meaning until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible: he abandons the fantasy of personal absolution for collective responsibility. Orientation is immediate (“Zephyr Bluff,” “Elias Veyne”), and every beat tightens toward the door’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density (fog, rain, river’s growl), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where Elias releases urgency as the storm breaks. Cost is legible in the fraying rope, the ticking gutters, and the final image of balance amid chaos. Orientation is immediate (“fog,” “river,” “coachman”), and the single scene tightens coherently toward closure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the oasis doesn’t resist change—it holds all versions of itself. The lantern glass healing and bowl filling with honey reweights time as memory, not linearity. Cost is legible: Ren surrenders linear understanding for layered truth, and the vibrant blue’s return implies irreversible perceptual shift. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern of fractures → wholeness is taught early and paid off precisely at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s handover of the gauge reconfigures legacy from preservation to transmission, with visible cost (his own solitude deepened). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the quivering hush, lantern light, and recurring oar rhythm intensify meaning through density, not causality. Orientation is clear by line 30; the single scene holds spatial and emotional coherence. Cost is legible in Lila clutching the tool “like the last lifeline,” and Elias’s empty garden spot.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira chooses to carry the past forward rather than erase or be consumed by it, with visible cost (years of isolation, fractured self). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring sensory motifs (hum, shadow, reflection) until the library physically responds to her reading. The stone circle’s hum and sundial’s shadow function as causal anchors, not coincidences. Cost is legible in “heart lighter than it had been in years”—a reconfiguration paid for in solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s shift from seeking external patterns to accepting self-inclusion reconfigures her relationship to secrecy, with cost legible in the keeper returning her letter and the artist’s mirror revealing her own reflection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each spiral (nest, installation, lotus) deepens thematic density without causal breaks. The “whimsical” suggestion functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence, because it emerges from the keeper’s established role as spiritual interlocutor.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because tricksters feed on chaos, Mara must act subtly; therefore she chooses subsonic interference. Orientation is immediate and precise—radio booth, night, celestial data—and closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the community’s tension dissipates, but the war continues. Cost is legible in Mara’s exhaustion and the “battles won and wars yet to come” framing. Every beat tightens toward the decisive press of the button.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Conceptual Repricing closure: the Nexus reweights from ruin to dimensional vessel, with the cost being irreversible perception (“you can’t unsee it”). Orientation is immediate (“last time Elias saw the sky… through the fractured dome”), and causality follows a Causal lens—each discovery (hum, organ, figure) motivates the next move. The compass handoff functions as a decisive act that triggers the shift, not coincidence. The only flaw: the organ’s origin remains unanchored in-world, slightly muddying the cause of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s face becomes “finally whole” in the sketch, reconfiguring her from victim to person, with visible cost in Elara’s tightened grip and sweat-slicked ribbon. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the quarry’s mist, ribbon, lance, and sketch accrue meaning until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 3 (quarry, Elara, dusk), and causality holds: each object reveals knowledge that deepens pressure. The lance’s late introduction is justified by its function as buried truth, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira stands at the threshold of continuing Elias’s mission, with the sky’s mutability and the station’s groaning underscoring irreversible cost. The Causal lens holds—each discovery (reversible stanza, nail-as-key) tightens options until the furnace reveals the truth. Orientation is immediate (“cliffside weather station”), and the jet stream shift anchors time. The final line crystallizes stakes without resolving them, leaving agency legible and pressure intact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena’s decision to drive onward crystallizes stakes (faith in small traces vs. need for resolution) with felt cost—the hitchhiker’s disappearance remains unanswered, yet she carries his relic forward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (glass flake, bridge-song, pixelation) deepen through recurrence, culminating in the valley “loading” as rain begins. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (“mountain scenic pullout,” “Lena,” present tense). Cost is legible in the final image: world remains “pixelated,” but beauty persists through deliberate attention.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered echoes: the circus train mirrors the startup, which mirrors the father’s life. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—Elias redefines circular paths as spirals—charged with the conceptual cost of abandoning inherited fatalism. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3; the fox’s reappearance and rain rhythmically tighten the final beat. The ledger, unicycle, and foreign bills accumulate meaning without redundancy, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights all prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “The burden is ours to share” reframes inscriptions from puzzle to invitation, with felt cost in Elias’s isolation-to-solidarity arc. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dreams intensify like converging starlight, culminating in midnight’s resonant poise. Orientation is clear by line 3; telegram and observatory anchor time/place. Cost is legible in Elias’s clenched fists and abandoned solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the lake-mirror reveals not just Veyra’s complicity but reweights the entire premise—the “curse” was never external but the lie she carried. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, escalating via memory-unraveling tendrils that deepen thematic density rather than causal turns. Cost is legible in the final image: the abandoned child now armed, the vortex unwound, and Veyra’s identity shattered. Orientation is anchored instantly (“druid,” “cursed lake,” “frost-rimed mud”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the world tilts into the star-strewn plain, options crystallize (“Together”), and cost is felt in Elias’s lifelong solitude now exchanged for shared risk. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (cobalt glade → ozone → star-tapestry), culminating in reconfiguration. The maze clipping’s pulse and scar linkage provide causal anchors. Cost is legible: he abandons solitary witness for vulnerable partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora forecloses the path of retrieval by trading her most painful memory, crystallizing her stance with palpable cost (“soul heavier”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and ritual acts until the decisive exchange. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Liora; where: catacomb orchard; when: post-sealing). The burned card’s disintegration and seed’s burial reconfigure meaning without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Charged Poise crystallizes as Jake shifts from listening to echoes to hearing a real voice, reconfiguring his relationship to sound, failure, and connection. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through sensory echoes, wind, and recurring motifs that culminate in Lena’s appearance. Cost is legible: Jake relinquishes ghostly self-punishment for uncertain hope. Orientation is immediate and sustained; causality isn’t required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “Not lost. Only changed” reweights the entire premise with emotional cost (the guardian’s absence, Elara’s yearning). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density and pattern shift (cuneiform rearrangement), not causality. Cost is legible in Elara’s misting eyes and the arbor’s “haunted ambitions.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and patterned repetition (moon, tide, books, creel), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—stories are not kept but released to migrate anew. Closure lands with conceptual cost: Elias relinquishes control, trusting the sea to carry meaning forward. The creel’s drift reweights the entire premise of archival permanence. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the inspector’s stance crystallizes when she admits her fear, transforming the bunker from tomb to reliquary to empty vessel. Cost is legible—the pearl dulls, the confessions vanish, the crown is left behind—and the latent radiance fades like “a held note finally released.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of confessions, then releases via dissolution. Every story beat tightens around the central act of witnessing, with no causal breaks or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (ivy, graffiti, river, map, accordion) that culminate in a Charged Poise closure: Lena walking toward the river, no longer seeking forgiveness but a way to live with truth. Cost is legible—the unanswerable letters, the useless map, the discordant music—and the ivy-choked station functions as both archive and crucible. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single scene structure fits scope perfectly. The only hairline flaw: the transition from bathroom reflection to exit lacks a micro-beat of decision, slightly softening the causal seam.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library is revealed not as place but process, reweighting silence and delay as sites of meaning. Cost is legible in the dreamer’s transformation from observer to participant—the notebook fills, then the blank book demands her handwriting, culminating in a letter that vanishes into mist, foreclosing her old scholarly identity. Orientation is masterfully handled: “glowing library in mist” grounds us by line 1; disorientation serves the theme and pays off at closure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via symbol, watch, and voice until the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the coffee stains shift from ruin to unwritten future, reweighting destiny itself. The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural + Causal)—pressure builds via sensory density (plants screaming, ice cracking) and culminates in a decisive act (playing the note that vanishes her father). Cost is legible: the empire lost, her father gone, her hands numb. Orientation is clear by line 30; causality holds without retroactive patches or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Liora’s stance crystallizes (“she would return… to stand watch”) with undeniable cost—the emerald spent, the reprieve temporary, her vigil endless. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: auroral shifts, ice hums, and frost patterns deepen pressure without causal turns, reweighting the stake through cadence and density. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies. Cost is legible in the dimmed emerald and “shadow stretching long”—a resonant reconfiguration of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “contentment” is redefined not as absence of pain but as active release, crystallized in Mira walking forward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring images (scallop, grotto, vineyard hush), culminating in the pool’s revelation. Cost is legible: she surrenders the relic that symbolized brokenness, trading it for self-tending. Orientation anchors instantly (“umbral grotto,” “Mira”), and the two-shard structure (tree → grotto) transitions cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density (wind, chimes, ash), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the lighthouse transformed from accusation to shared space.

Orientation is solid by line 30; closure reweights every prior image without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara doesn’t reverse time but steps outside it, redefining “vanishing” as presence. The cost—abandoning the quest for literal youth in favor of perceptual freedom—is legible in her smooth hands and altered understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ripples, hum, leaves, and stone rings build density until the pond’s stillness crystallizes meaning. The grotto’s mechanics remain mysterious but consistent within the story’s poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern recognition until the flock’s disruption triggers closure. The ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing—the “pulse left wandering” is revealed as waiting—and crystallizes Elias’s transformation into a navigator of stasis. Cost is legible in the final line: he trades forward motion for eternal echo-wandering. Orientation is immediate (“canyon of endless echoes,” “Elias crouched”), and causality flows through perception rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias renounces the pursuit of grand magic, accepting slow learning as valid, with visible cost (abandoned satchel, relinquished expectations). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the mist, luminance, and keystone build a resonant pattern that culminates in the blooming flower. Cost is legible in the final image: the sacred found in simplicity, not spectacle. Orientation is clear by line 30; disorientation serves closure via mist-walking dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (light, keys, sound) until the final conceptual repricing: luminous vows as inherited duty. Orientation is immediate—pier lamplighter at dusk—and closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias recognizes his role in a legacy, with cost implied in lifelong unknowing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias endures his role but reconfigures it through naming, foreclosing silence with visible cost (the grooves worn smooth, the tears offered but unused). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via layered echoes (recordings, marginalia, sea monsters) until the final beam crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in “the dead, at last, were silent”—a peace bought by voice, not violence. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds not through plot turns but through intensifying sensory density (light, sound, water) until the bell’s imperfect ring triggers a resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where silence breaks not with restoration but with fragile acknowledgment. Cost is legible in the bell’s unrepaired cracks and the fishermen’s continued despair; the world still tilts, yet Elias endures.

Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: coherent environmental pressure (the arbor, wind, failing branches) forces Elias to crystallize his stance from passive observer to active survivor. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the final image of him climbing toward the city reconfigures his relationship to the world below with undeniable cost (the burden of trust, the physical toll, the near-fall). The “snap” of the branch functions as a decisive intensification that narrows options and validates the harness. Cost is legible in the buckle biting into his side and the suspended breath—no slips in causality or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael steps toward the edge, not knowing if he’ll fly or fall, but moving nonetheless—the numbness remains but is reconfigured as “one color in the spectrum.” Cost is legible in the abandonment of the duplicate-brain delusion and the acceptance of incomplete healing. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sensory detail, pattern breaks (clumsy attack replacing technique), and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. History “rewriting itself” tightens the frame without disrupting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: repeated deliveries deepen mystery while narrowing Lena’s options, culminating in Charged Poise—she turns off the light as the flower blooms, ready for confrontation. Cost is legible in her isolation, vigilance, and emotional reckoning. Orientation is clear by line 30; the closure reconfigures silence from refuge to battleground. Minor deduction for the courier’s second appearance lacking causal setup.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterned sound, silence, and wind build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the household’s laughter returns not through dialogue or plot mechanics but through accumulated sonic pressure. The closure is decisive—the mother laughs, the girl smiles—and carries conceptual cost: Elias’s anonymity is broken, yet he accepts it as necessary. Orientation is immediate (“conductor,” “echo chamber tunnel”), and causality is maintained through repeated visits (police → weeping → listening), culminating in the girl’s approach. The final image reweights all prior silence into joy without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara stops waiting, reconfiguring her stance with felt cost (the pendant’s bite, the unanswerable homesickness). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through sensory layering and motif recurrence until the final crystallization. The “interiorizing exteriors” insight deepens stakes without retroactive causality breaks. Cost is legible in the cold pendant and closed book—no path back to passive yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: alchemy redefined from gold-making to creative destruction, with visible cost in the shattered crozier and wasted life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring images (crozier, ember nexus, mercury) until the final explosion reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate (“Elias Veyne’s workshop,” “twilight”), and causality flows via successive approximation → realization → detonation. The “penny drops” beat pivots cleanly into irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (static, silence, perigee) until the “shard of hush” crystallizes into closure via Conceptual Repricing: origins are illusions, beginnings are states, not moments. Cost is legible—the tower’s collapse, Mira’s vanishing—and the final image reweights all prior searching. Orientation is clear by line 30; the pattern of signal-to-silence is taught early and pays off precisely at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the commuters vanish, the ferry stabilizes, and Elias’s stance crystallizes with felt cost—the enduring solitude of being a “permanent transient.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating starlight, radio static, and shimmering passengers deepen atmospheric pressure until the hourglass hums in resonance. Orientation is clear by line 3; time’s distortion (“clocks running sideways”) functions as taught disorientation that pays off thematically. Cost is legible in Veyra’s exhausted exhale and Elias’s silent pocketing of the empty glass.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pressure builds through sensory and perceptual density, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—redefining “connection” as something alive and spatially transformative. Closure is achieved via Charged Poise: Elias stands in a void, tethered by the unwound thread, with options crystallized (he has crossed into dream-space) and cost felt (loss of gallery reality, altered memory).

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist, static, and pulses intensify rhythmically until the atrium “bleeds into the past.” Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when clear by line 3), and the photograph-hearing aid-mist triad tightens pressure without causal breaks. Cost is felt in Lena’s isolation and implied fate (“they’ll take you”).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses escape to bear witness, with visible cost (drowning, erasure). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—gold flecks, cables, tide, and brine build a resonant pattern that culminates in the phase transition. Cost is legible in the final image: “stars swallowed by dawn.” Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite surreal elements because rules are dramatized early (e.g., codex mapping non-existent paths).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and recurring motifs until the static-laden phone call triggers a Conceptual Repricing: reality itself is porous. Closure lands decisively with Elias’s metamorphosis—a Decisive Change charged with conceptual cost (loss of human form) and emotional resonance (translucent fingers, glowing veins). Every element—the arrowhead, phone, garden—converges causally at the climax. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora’s leap and new performance crystallize her stance—beauty must be fought for, not just maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of separation/reunion (ravine, foam, chrysalis) intensify until Lina’s insight crystallizes into a Charged Poise—she reconfigures her scientific ethos and relational stance without overt action. Cost is legible: she abandons her lifelong pursuit of permanence, accepting impermanence as strength. The closure lands with conceptual weight—the ravine becomes a “map,” not a maze—and the drive lens holds consistently from midpoint to end.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterned imagery (bottled moonlight, fading name, dandelion coat) builds density until the final image reweights the premise: beginnings reside in silence before speech. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the absence of the bottle carries more weight than its presence—with undeniable cost (the coin’s warmth fading, the name vanishing). The chime-and-cloud ending crystallizes Charged Poise: options are legible, stakes reconfigured, yet no path is taken. Orientation is clear by line 3; disorientation is never invoked nor needed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael stands, the coral warms, and they walk out together—options reconfigured, not resolved. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with tidal patterns, rain memory, and frozen coral accruing meaning until the final reweighting: “It’s not a tomb—it’s a promise.” Cost is legible in Maren’s lightened memories and Kael’s exhausted emergence.

The final spiral of wind and sealed containers delivers Charged Poise: options foreclosed, stakes reweighted, cost felt in the howl.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Eira endures disruption to release the song, and the world’s silence afterward confirms cost paid. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via sensory density (colors fracturing) and auroral instability, not causality. The sculptor’s chisel strikes function as rhythmic interference, not character-driven opposition, keeping focus on Eira’s internal stakes. Cost is legible in the final image: the cavern’s hush now cradles her, implying ongoing vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the boundary was never a wall but a thread. The flute’s melody stitches worlds, transforming jagged rupture into smooth integration—a decisive reconfiguration with conceptual cost (abandoning restoration for coexistence). Causal lens holds: each action (uncasing, following driftwood, playing) triggers the next. Orientation anchors instantly (“Elias,” “Thunder-echo Range,” post-fallen guardian), and the single scene escalates cleanly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias endures in darkness, equations unsolved but present, his mind quiet after years of noise—a reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the death of borrowed selves, the last star). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via refracted light, humming fragment, layered voices, culminating in dissolution and silence. Cost is legible in “fingers still stained with ink” and “mind quiet for the first time”—a stark before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ridgeway breathes, options crystallize, and she steps forward with steady hands, having internalized the relic’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—auroras, pendant vibrations, and ozone scent intensify until the final image reweights “delivery” as transformation. Cost is legible: her old life of forgettable towns is foreclosed; the pendant goes cold, its magic spent. Orientation anchors (courier, ridgeway, aurora) are clear by line 3 and serve the closure’s liminal charge.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of light, frost, and vibration accrue meaning until the prism’s warmth signals conceptual repricing. Orientation is immediate (“quartz arbor,” “Elias,” “cold air”), and closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing—the truth is “bent, fractured, a truthful lie”—with felt cost (abandoning proof for communion). The frost’s melting visually enacts loss, and the arbor’s hum fading marks irreversible shift. Every image tightens around the central question without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara abandons her loom, accepts the orchard’s forgetting, and re-enters the world—not for Kael, but for herself. Cost is legible in the unworn shawl, unfinished tapestry, and bamboo forest left behind. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density and recurring motifs (silence, raveling, amber light)—and the puzzle map’s early introduction pays off cohesively.

The spiral’s growth, the shifting stones, and the final note cohere into an undeniable before/after. No causality breaks; every beat tightens the thematic coil without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Veyra’s stance crystallizes when she mirrors the ink-stained woman’s gesture, accepting her role as bridge-builder between eras, with the cost being deferred arrival (“step into the light and let it carry her home”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring images (emerald glow, shadows, ink) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate and precise (“emerald lighthouse on the cliff’s edge”), and the prophetic slip functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence. The final pulse of the lighthouse reweights all prior imagery with undeniable promise and price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the map’s symbols shimmer not because they’ve been altered, but because the dye master now sees stories as iridescent phenomena—fleeting, contextual, relational.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds not through causal chains but through layered sensory and symbolic density (whispering walls, moonlight, trees, lost fragments). Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Elias reinterprets the tower not as prison but vessel, with clear conceptual cost: he bears witness so others need not. The pin’s click anchors time early and echoes at the end, creating structural symmetry that deepens meaning without causality breaks. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s song rekindles dawn not through magic alone but communal participation, with tangible cost (her voice raw, people’s exhaustion overcome through shared effort). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (mica windows, songs, golden light) that culminate in a cadence shift at the village square. Orientation is immediate (“alchemical orchard greenhouse,” “mirror world,” “endless night”), and the two-shard structure (greenhouse → village) transitions cleanly. The final image—dawn flickering, keeper dissolving—reconfigures hope as active, collective labor, not passive rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias steps out with map in hand, crystallizing options under undeniable pressure. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the paradoxes, invitation, and regret layer into a cadence shift at midnight that reweights wisdom as action, not contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias chooses endurance, locking frequencies to preserve the vow, with visible cost (the library’s decay, his isolation). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density and cadence shifts (“quartz hush” → spectral glow → flickering plea). Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is maintained via object-driven escalation. Cost is legible in the final image: he remains, breath curling, as meaning endures amid dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the truce holds, but Lena knows betrayal is only delayed—hope persists “fragile, stubborn.” The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear from the outset (sensory density, pattern of silence → crack → restoration), and the ending reweights the opening stillness with emotional cost. Orientation is immediate (“pier,” “moonshine runner’s daughter,” “tonight”), and causality flows through sensory cues (false starts → blade scrape → intervention). The watch fob’s return in the climax and closing image ties the arc without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara stands at the threshold of understanding, compass spinning, trees marching—options crystallized, cost felt (abandoning skepticism’s safety). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: aurora, forest hum, raindrops coalesce into a resonant pattern that reweights “weather-carriers” from myth to lived truth. Every beat tightens toward this revelation without causal breaks. The ending image makes the before/after legible through embodied awe, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterned imagery (laughter, lock, painting, door) intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias steps into golden light, transforming from chronicler of the lost to their guide home. Orientation is immediate—“charcoal-stained fingers,” “subterranean crystal cave”—and the dream shard transitions cleanly, taught by the lock’s hum. Closure lands with conceptual cost: he abandons his role as solitary archivist for active redemption. The persistent constraint (the broken lock) shapes tactics and crystallizes in the final image, fulfilling all high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: because Liora found the postal fragment, she pried the floorboard; because she reconstructed the map, she went to the archives; because she located the seam, she descended. Orientation is solid by line 3 (who/where/when). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the staircase into darkness reconfigures all prior stakes, with cost felt in the brittle flower and humid decay. The only flaw: the treasure map’s origin remains unmotivated, creating a faint causality gap at the inciting discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s placement of the glass orb triggers a resonant reconfiguration where the sculpture sings brighter, implying a child below may remember wonder—foreclosing despair without resolving the world’s silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via density of sensory detail and patterned recurrence (iceberg → orb → frozen blue lattice), culminating in a cadence shift at the climax. Cost is legible in the melting fragment and Elias’s impending muteness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)

Orientation is clear by line 3; every beat links via “because/therefore,” and the final image crystallizes stakes without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dice, staircase, infinity) until the pattern breaks with the roll. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the infinite staircase adapts rather than ends, reweighting Elias’s quest from proof of limits to acceptance of mutable continuity. Cost is legible in the altered tilt of the steps—a physical manifestation of irreversible change. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she doesn’t sleep but finds purpose in distributing painted kindness, crystallizing options under waxing moonlight. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density (smog, mint, bone brush) until the final image reweights “kindness as language” with conceptual cost (her insomnia transformed into generative wakefulness). Orientation anchors are clear by line 3; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint—urban decay vs. fragile art—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tapestry moves, bees return, and Liora’s act reconfigures cultural memory with conceptual cost (the fragility of transmission). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory motifs (bread, bees, threads)—and the opera glass’s shift from passive observation to active witness charges the ending. Cost is legible: traditions dissolve unless actively remade, a truth paid for by generations’ silence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: time’s direction is redefined, the hunger stone is blanked, and Elias gains agency over temporal flow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring objects (yoyo, stone, beam), culminating in a cadence shift when the tide reverses. Cost is legible: the names vanish, history is unmade, and Elias bears the burden of remembrance. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias starves fear by refusing its narrative, foreclosing internal possession with tangible cost (abandoning the cursed cloak and Polaroid). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density and recurring motifs that reconfigure at the end. Orientation is immediate and functional; the funhouse setting serves disorientation that pays off in the final mirror confrontation. Cost is legible in the torn photo and discarded clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Leeward shifts from interpreter to collaborator, crystallized when “the world was singing back.” Cost is legible—the lifelong solitude of prophecy now exchanged for reciprocal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira now understands the watchers guard not the city but the cracks, and her choice to seek them all crystallizes new stakes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern languages, spiral motifs, and recurring objects deepen meaning without causal linearity. Cost is legible in the expedition’s hollow eyes and Mira’s irreversible knowledge. Orientation anchors instantly (“city of Carapax… backs of three gargantuan turtles”).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the letter’s legacy is redefined not by exposure but by contextual display, making truth and lie coexist. The causal chain—from rose petal drop to journal clue to confrontation—is tight, and the final image (bare branches against twilight) crystallizes the cost of preservation. Orientation is flawless within 60 words; the drive lens (Causal) holds through every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pavilion “breathes” because Elias’s witnessing reconfigures absence into presence-with-cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the three notes deepen density, each intensifying the thematic weight, culminating in inkwell depletion as tangible sacrifice. Cost is legible: the empty inkwell, soaked boots, and solitude after the bridge descends. Orientation anchors are clear by line 20; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and patterned motifs until the ledger discovery triggers a Conceptual Repricing: the past indexing him. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (“submerged library,” “Elias Veyne”), and disorientation serves closure (the blackout as veil). The cost—personal identity foreclosed into legacy—is undeniable in the final image of earned stasis. Every beat tightens toward this reconfiguration with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (cranes, glass, light) until the lantern shatters—a decisive Conceptual Repricing where dreams are revealed as parasitic, not curative. Cost is legible in the final image: Veyra’s body becomes a vessel, her autonomy forfeited. Orientation is clear by line 30; the floating isle, tea garden, and basilica establish spatial logic that holds through closure. The “shadow detached” backstory is minimally deployed but functional within BRR allowances.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena doesn’t resolve her grief but crystallizes her stance—“the hunt wasn’t over”—with alarms wailing and the observatory groaning, making stakes and options legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The geode’s pulse, circuit breakers’ cooldown, and ghostly encounter cohere into a resonant reconfiguration where unused potential leads not to healing but deeper pursuit. Cost is felt in her seared palm and the collapsing structure—a tangible price for knowledge. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3, and the drive lens holds from first shard to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias chooses to follow the call, crystallizing options while leaving the destination unknown; cost is felt in the abandonment of his solitary routine and the observatory’s safety. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory layering (ozone, parchment, humming light) until the chip’s resonance reweights everything. Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality flows via pattern recognition, not mechanical cause-effect, which suits the lens. Final image (“the call wouldn’t”) carries undeniable conceptual cost: belonging requires surrender to mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias walks toward truth, foreclosing his life of complicity, with the broken watch and rusted key as tangible costs. The causal lens holds—each beat follows from prior knowledge or choice (finding the carving → confronting uncle → deciding to go). Orientation is clear by line 3; the driftwood symbol payoff is earned. Cost is legible in the snapped hands and numb fingers—irreversible acts that reconfigure his future.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: mist, moon phases, and recurring objects build density until the Charged Poise closure crystallizes stakes without action. Orientation is immediate (“parapet,” “Elias Veyne,” “dawn”), and the single scene holds spatial coherence. The closure—a widening silence between figures as dawn arrives—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options foreclosed, peace deferred, cost felt in what isn’t said or done. The drawer pull and locket reweight each other, making the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias stops navigating by his father’s map, foreclosing that identity with the compass’s loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (salt air, utility poles, lapping tide) until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in “the ripples fading as quickly as his old life.” Orientation is immediate, causality intact, and the single decisive act (discarding the compass) reshapes his entire trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Situational lens: coherent pressure (the labyrinth as test) forces stance crystallization. Closure is Charged Poise—the final realization that “the only way out was to look” reconfigures meaning with undeniable emotional cost. The baseball functions as both key and constraint; the mirrors force confrontation without mechanical resolution. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality remains tight despite reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora endures loss while reforging bond, with visible emotional cost (“tears cutting silver paths”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the orchard’s sensory density intensifies toward the phoenix’s rebirth, and the permanent moonlight frames a world where death bends but doesn’t break. Every beat tightens around the central stake: can love persist beyond form? The final image reconfigures “return” as transformation, not recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces mending the past, embracing how breaking “made room for something new,” with visible emotional cost (“weight of a name unspoken”). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via sensory layering (ozone, violets, silvered grass) and cadence shifts toward the resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“onyx-ink cartomancer knelt in the midnight glade above the clouds”). The saucer’s crack functions as both map and revelation, driving the story’s reconfiguration without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora endures, foreclosing her own survival to release the Euthymia into the wound. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—each photograph deepens sorrow’s density until Kwan Yin’s Tear empties, reweighting the ship’s purpose. Cost is legible in the locket’s hollowness and her untethered float. Orientation is anchored instantly (“recycled spaceship,” “Liora,” “bioluminescent algae”) and disorientation serves closure—the void isn’t confusion but thematic silence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s shift from invisible helper to public savior crystallizes under volcanic pressure with felt cost (loss of anonymity, assumption of prophetic burden). The detour → encounter → eruption sequence forms a tight causal chain under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture + Causal action). Cost is legible in the lightning bug’s extinction and his irreversible run toward duty. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s torch-lighting crystallizes options—revolution is now inevitable, with cost felt in the city’s looming destruction. The causal lens holds tightly: blackout → cipher → quill holder → parchment → signal.

Cost is legible: she foregoes direct confrontation, accepting that others will bear the violence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias completes the sequence, mends the pattern, and endures the cost of inherited responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory withdrawal, then intensifies via star dust and rock placement until the aurora flares. Cost is legible: the “weight in his chest” lifts only after he acts, confirming the promise was active debt, not passive memory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and image layering until the lightning-flash climax reweights the photograph as a map. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the scars are not wounds but territories—and cost is legible in Elias’s laughter swallowed by storm and his silent departure with the envelope against his chest. Orientation is immediate (observatory, storm, poet), and the single scene tightens around the timer’s beeps and the photograph’s revelation. The persistent constraint—the censored voice—shapes every observation and refusal to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: each question begets a response that narrows options, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the duel transforms into a shared journey. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30, and the closure—a Charged Poise where both choose collaboration over victory—carries felt cost: surrendering adversarial identity. The needle card’s alignment with the sundial is a motivated ellipsis that pays off causally, not coincidentally.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lumen chooses rebuilding over molting, crystallizing options under the weight of the key’s promise. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through lyrical density (ink, stars, rust) until the final image reweights “resistance” as stewardship, not protest. Cost is legible in the abandoned vagrancy and the library’s reclaimed silence. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; causality flows via emotional accumulation, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clock ticks again, compasses still, ocean revealed—but Elias hasn’t “fixed” his loss; he’s reconfigured his relationship to time and fate. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density (mist, creaking wood, spinning compasses) until the encore ruptures the pattern. Cost is legible—the seventeen years of silence, the exhaustion of travelers—and the film reel functions as motivated lore, not deus ex machina. Orientation is flawless by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Liora reweights the monsoon from natural event to sentient bargainer, with undeniable conceptual cost (“the storm’s true nature”). The causal chain—avoidance → dream → planting → revelation → resolve—is tight, motivated, and escalates under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The ridge’s silence post-sprouting crack signals a before/after legible in both knowledge and stance. Cost is felt in the weight of withheld truth (“Not all of it—some truths needed time to grow”).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and symbolic recurrence until the lace reveals a path of memory-stitches. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s final act reconfigures regret from burden to material for mending, with conceptual cost legible in the needle’s stilling and his earned smile. The compass’s function as memory-guide—not direction—is taught early and pays off coherently. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty.
