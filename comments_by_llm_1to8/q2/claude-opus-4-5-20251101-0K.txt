  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's acceptance that "understanding came not in revelations but in the gradual settling of sediment" forecloses the search for tidy answers with visible cost—she demolishes the greenhouse, disperses the collection, keeps only fragments. The accumulative lens holds: repeated dust/decay imagery deepens until the final orchid reweights survival versus entropy. Causality is clean; the orientation anchor (greenhouse, post-flood, sorting task) arrives immediately. One meaningful deepening (from logistics to humility) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational. Orientation anchors clearly (glass artist, canyon, post-poisoning, night-to-dawn). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Elena's decision to create "works that captured this canyon's frozen mathematics" reweights her artistic purpose with conceptual cost (rejecting commissions, abandoning patron-approval model). One meaningful deepening occurs when frost patterns unlock the ledger's code, shifting her knowledge and crystallizing her stance. The patron's death by his own poison weakens causal pressure since Elena's agency didn't drive that reversal, but the decoding sequence and final resolve compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through density increase and cadence shift—each specimen interaction builds toward the final realization that silence itself is a new language. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Margaret accepts permanent silence and commits to thermal translation, foreclosing recovery of hearing with visible emotional cost ("drowned her hearing," "learning to listen with her eyes"). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening (specimen work → self-recognition via thermal sensors painting her own emotion gold) satisfies scope. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is prompt (undertaker, mortuary, Tuesday package), and the lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: the lens fragments pulse → Ezra descends → learns names → lens reassembles → souls find peace. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ezra stops running from stillness and the lens's purpose is fulfilled. Cost is visible—his deepening weariness and the seven-night labor—and the library's peace is confirmed on-page. One tightening: the distress signal escalates from pulse to immersion to the final beacon. No causality breaks, though the dream-or-death descent could signal its rules more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who: Mira; where: terra-cotta arbor; when: sanctions period, tonight). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the runs, bell-ringing, and photograph accumulate toward a tonal deepening rather than a causal turn. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the photograph of the unchanged homeland plus the decision to "run again" crystallizes the waiting-as-resistance stance. Cost is conceptual (endurance with no end in sight) but legible. Weaknesses: the anonymous donation setup never pays off causally—it remains backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes a choice—and the closure image ("hope would continue its patient work") tilts toward theme-statement rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—breath patterns, jasmine, and luminous threads build toward a final image that reweights the premise of unused love. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of "luminous residue" spiraling upward reconfigures the opening question ("where does unused love go?") with conceptual cost made visible through the woman's release. One meaningful deepening occurs when breath darkness transforms into luminous threads, narrowing the protagonist's understanding and charging the final photograph.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs—Elara's dissolution into time's fabric with the cost of bodily existence—though the price feels more conceptual than viscerally dramatized in the final beat. The causal chain (retrocognitive trap → halo fragment → hyperbolic geometry → temporal integration) holds, but the monks' backstory and the fading photographs function more as atmospheric setup than active complications. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the fragment to the bridge convergence, and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a lyric closure, which the piece supports without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: Mira decodes keys → descends into vault → scout chooses mercy → Mira escapes with seeds. Closure arrives on the page as a Decisive Change (she leaves with the seeds, the wall falls, resilience work begins) with visible cost (chains remain, work ahead is hard). The drive lens reads Causal with light Situational pressure from the scout encounter. One friction: the scout's reversal lacks sufficient prior setup, making the turn feel slightly unmotivated, though the ending image does reweight the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Marina completes the device and commits to sending it, crystallizing the relationship's fractured state with undeniable emotional cost ("the exact shade of broken green"). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory imprints, memory fragments, and the forge work, culminating in the moment she hears her own fourteen-year-old voice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the imprint reveals her voice saying "I believe you," reweighting the entire project. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who/where/when anchored early). The connection between collecting absences and the final frequency feels somewhat abstract but remains legible under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with situational coloring; the heist proceeds through motivated steps (flower code → approach → swap → escape). Orientation anchors quickly (emerald station, Platform Seven, sunset timing). However, closure lacks visible cost: Mira walks away cleanly with the prize and the orphanage release happens off-page, so the final image offers sentiment without on-page consequence. The collector's cry of dismay is witnessed but does not reconfigure Mira's options or exact a felt price from her.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (control room, seventeen years, Elena). Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena commits to descend, pockets the bookmark, and begins drafting plans—options crystallize with felt cost (abandoning "simple cold of isolation"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the red light flickers, shifting her from contemplation to action. Cost is legible in the final image: she trades solitude for community risk. The lens holds; density and cadence increase toward the ending, reweighting the thawing motif.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (rusted library, Scotland, DNA results three hours ago). The causal chain—DNA results → coordinates in seashell → library location → confrontation with Sandra → recorded confession—holds without breaks. However, the climactic reversal hinges on a convenience: Marla's younger self "already building the case" by scrawling notes on a cast, which Sandra somehow never discovered in thirty years. The closure unit (Sandra's confession, Marla's freedom) lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract ("breathing freely") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical price paid in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs (the photograph evidence), sufficient for this length, but the ending relies on a late-revealed past action rather than present agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers sensory density (bloodied feet, flaking gold, dimming stars) toward a final reconfiguration where the oracle completes her map and the booklet glows faintly. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the endless night remains but becomes navigable, reweighting the void from annihilation to charted territory. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, three-day climb, solitary descent into darkness). One minor slip: the "borrowed light" glow at the end hints at resolution comfort that slightly softens the conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning, building density through recurring images (seventeen silences, the violin, sweeping) that converge at closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Unit-7's return to sweeping after the violin dissolves represents acceptance with conceptual cost—the seeking ends, the loop continues. One meaningful deepening occurs when Unit-7 plays the violin and understands its purpose, then chooses the eternal return with eyes open.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the post-language world is established early, pressure accumulates through Mira's observation and the exchange of objects, and the final image reconfigures prior material (the lens as distance-keeping tool, the doodles as translation of chaos). Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the exchange crystallizes a shift from mistrust to shared presence, and the final beat (Mira adding to the ticket, Theo's shoulders loosening) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is felt but oblique—Mira gives away her "protection," Theo's ice "begins to thaw"—and the consequence remains largely conceptual rather than actionable. The orientation is anchored by ~120 words (Mira, forecourt, night registrar role), so no penalty applies. One deduction: the eleven-year backstory and three-month world-change are exposition blocks that compress momentum slightly, though they anchor the present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Esther, gardens, post-Commission world). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the marble collection ritual, deepens with Elena's visit, and crystallizes in the maze revelation where Esther reframes her entire career. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Elena grasps the secret, chooses to return to the parks, and the cost is legible: she inherits both the practice and the burden of persistence without mystique. The piece holds its lens cleanly and the final image of Esther polishing marbles reweights all prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's patient observation and mapping converge at the twilight nexus, and the closure image—cloudweavers departing, data chip pressed to heart—reweights her prior solitary work with subdued certainty. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The tightening is present (nexus forms, anomaly appears, proof secured) but the cost remains oblique—she'll face "verification, peer review, years of confirmation studies" tomorrow, yet no immediate price or foreclosed path is legible on the page. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) qualifies as subdued awakening with felt certainty, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: water stains accrue meaning, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Clara retrieves vindication and the ghost's face softens into peace—Charged Poise qualifies as closure. Orientation anchors promptly (flooded opera house, Clara, present night). The cost is somewhat implied (years of invisible labor now repurposed, a career pivot awaiting) but not sharply dramatized on the page; the final image reweights her marginality positively without a felt price in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the hidden panel and documents, narrowing her path to public action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (mountain station, post-fever, oracle protagonist). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (frost crystals, smudged illustration, auroras) and reflections that cohere at closure when Cassandra chooses silence over prophecy. The closure is Earned Stasis—she withholds the vision, forecloses loyalty to the Consortium, and accepts the private weight—with conceptual cost legible in "some fault-tolerant oracles learned to fail in exactly the right way." One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from fevered confusion to deliberate choice. Cost is visible in her acceptance of complicity and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus's understanding crystallizes in the valve room, reweighting his seventeen-year search with visible cost (the weight "heavier but somehow easier to carry"). The causal chain holds—radio calls lead to valve room, beads confirm Daniela's presence, and the decision to drag the ghost shift into daylight forecloses his private grief. Orientation anchors early (tunnel, factory, three AM). One meaningful deepening occurs when physical discovery (amber bead) converts skepticism into testimonial duty. Cost is legible on the page in both his exhaustion and the shift from personal excavation to public witness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers image and reflection to deepen the thematic register of decay-as-renewal. However, no on-page closure unit lands with visible cost: the final paragraph restates the premise ("she witnessed," "she breathed back") without a decisive change, earned stasis that forecloses a path, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The piece offers mood and philosophy but no dramatic tightening or consequence that makes a before/after legible. Closure form is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by the first paragraphs). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (locket, eclipse, roots) and the gift of the locket reweights the mother-daughter dynamic at closure. The ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maya closes her fingers around the locket, crystallizing her stance on wonder—with felt cost (tears, impending separation). However, the cost is more asserted than viscerally dramatized, and the escalation is a single deepening rather than a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers discoveries (diary fragments → tapestry → axis revelation) to reweight the premise. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the displaced axis shifts from consequence to cause, and Maren's role crystallizes from collector to restorer. The cost is conceptual (the weight of restoring an axis) and felt in "the weight of an axis waiting to be restored," though the price remains more atmospheric than viscerally limiting. Orientation anchors quickly (silo library, Maren, post-Silence world). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tapestry reveals the axis predates the Silence, reconfiguring the stakes from preservation to correction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, Mei Lin, present night/tomorrow dawn) land cleanly by ~10% and the pattern of parallels (old spy work/new fortune work, microdots/fortunes, Cold War/present) is taught early. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the box-gift decision crystallizes her shift from hidden to revealed with conceptual cost (end of secrecy, transposition into "harmless eccentric"). The cost is legible in the final fortune and the journalist framing. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to give away the specs, reweighting all prior fortune-writing as orchestration. Lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with purposeful lyric layering (loop pedal creates textural pressure). Orientation anchors cleanly: Marcus, cathedral, dimensional anchor, three-minute timer. Escalation builds through Marcus's rhetorical interrogation narrowing the entity's grip, and closure delivers a Decisive Change (shadows dissolve, Elena laughs through tears) with felt cost—her certainty shattered. The loop pedal's final echo "What if doubt is sin?" reconfigures the opening question with conceptual price. One persistent constraint (the dimensional anchor hum, the three-minute clock) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the climb, the grandmother's instruction, the nautilus pattern, and the dawn converge to reweight Li Wei's understanding of homesickness and her fortune-writing vocation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she writes her final fortune and begins descent, foreclosing her old method with a conceptual cost legible in "chronologically homesick" reframed as "longing to carry forward." The cost, however, is largely conceptual and oblique; the felt price of exhaustion and the decision to stop are present but lack sharp on-page friction or a concrete trade-off that narrows options visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with its lyric recursion and pattern-driven structure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) emerge within the first 120 words. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: Mira's shift from seeking escape to accepting perpetual construction reweights the premise, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized on the page. The "for the first time, she felt not fragmented but whole" moment registers as realization but lacks a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that would charge the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The story offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Marina's acceptance that silence is potential rather than void), but the closure cost is implied rather than demonstrated through forfeited options or visible sacrifice. The causal chain from seeking Elias → receiving needle → drum session → emotional thaw is linear but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows her choices. The piece reads accumulative/textural, yet the final realization arrives without Marina making a decision that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (Mira in courtyard, after being followed, at dusk) and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration: her realization about manufactured weather shifts her from solitary observer to potential whistleblower, with the cost implicit in "already calculating her next lateral step" and the knowledge that she is now "dangerous." The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection and the gathering of storm data, message tube, and past anomalies. The closure image ("she began to walk home through the gathering dark") reweights her purpose with undeniable pressure, though the cost could be more concretely anchored in the final beat rather than promised for "tomorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates texture through Marcus's handling of the rope, the woman's arrival, and their shared reflection, but the closure lacks a decisive reconfiguration with visible cost. The final paragraph offers pattern-continuation ("choice by impossible choice") rather than a reweighting that makes a before/after legible. No meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through sensory layers (hush, water, greenhouse, shipwrecks) toward a cadence shift where silence becomes "the space between notes, necessary and full of meaning." Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (who, where, when all anchored). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marina's decision to play publicly tomorrow, accepting imperfection and interruption, forecloses her prior silence with visible cost—music will remain "interrupted by the chronic hush, shaped by loss." The final image reweights the dominant stake (finding voice after the burning) through the copper bowl glowing "like an ember," linking survival and beauty. One meaningful deepening occurs when she stops fighting and listens to the hush, narrowing her options from forcing sound to finding space.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (amber grotto, Vera, counterfeit dealer, dusk). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Vera will continue dealing but now "differently," carrying amber dusk as proof she can feel—and the cost is present: she renounces clinical distance, accepts permeability. One meaningful deepening occurs (inhaling the petal fully transforms her defenses). The chemist's message "You are not too far gone" functions as conceptual permission rather than causal pressure, softening the turn slightly, and the piece teaches its reflective mode early enough that the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal, with some Accumulative texture. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (cycle continues; Marina commits to ongoing work) with felt cost in the time and influence spent. The midpoint tightening—Elias's emotional response and Marina's decision to open her archives—narrows options and forecloses the simple return of the envelope. However, the ceremony montage and final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat, muting the cost. The cost is legible (Marina's resources, Elias's catharsis) but told, not shown in a decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the search ritual and Veren's sculpture placements. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (who/where/when established early). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the circle sculpture and Senna's welcome, but the cost remains abstract: what path does Veren foreclose by grafting onto this community? The piece teaches its pattern (search → sculptures → community formation), yet the final beat tells us the transformation ("realized that her search had never really been for the tag-maker") rather than showing a choice that narrows options. The extended backstory (marsh village loss, scattered people) consumes ~15% without altering present tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images of incompleteness (fossils, interrupted melodies, trapped echoes) and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Miriam hears the completed echo and draws a completed cadence, reweighting her life's work from cataloging death to witnessing restoration. Cost is legible: traded future time, exhaustion, pendant cooling. Orientation anchors (canal, towers, Aldros sleeping) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Miriam understands echoes are imprisoned, not born, which reframes her quest and leads directly to the cage-opening action. The because/therefore chain is clean within the accumulative frame, though the pendant's mechanics (how it sculpts time) remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/realization blend) at closure. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph and the escalation reads as deepening—Mira moves from searching for Theo to accepting her own survival calculus. The apparition sequence provides a meaningful turn that reweights her project, and the final image of carrying the glass eyes "at peace" delivers visible emotional cost (abandoning the search, accepting ambiguity). One structural seam: the apparition's thematic clarity risks feeling convenient rather than discovered, but the reweighting of her equations into self-mapping is legible and the closure lands on the page with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the closure form—Maren's decision to leave the letter crystallizes her role as "keeper" rather than ghost, with the cost felt in her renunciation of total invisibility. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, Maren emerging from crawl space) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The escalation reads as a density increase and cadence shift: from discovering the tape fragment to experiencing sense memory to organizing her cache to the unprecedented decision to leave evidence, culminating in the closing image of breathing with the library. The cost is somewhat diffuse—the risk of discovery is implied but not sharply dramatized—and the closure leans heavily on the final paragraph's thematic restatement rather than a charged image that holds cost without explanation. One tightening is present and sufficient for this length, but the resolution lacks a visible on-page price that would elevate clarity of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Vera, nursery, post-rain morning, storm season. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and recurring images (linden leaf, moss, rain, green threading through veins) accumulate pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost—she releases resistance, accepts transformation, and forecloses her former human boundary. The cost is legible: "death of what came before," roots descending, and her decision to keep the change "private as prayer." Causality is clean but light; the leaf's appearance and her body's changes motivate her walk and surrender without sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are clear within the first paragraph (lighthouse, tidal island, post-war setting). The story operates under a Hybrid lens tilting Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repetition of failed paintings, the rain-trail method, and convergence imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mira paints "something new" and her wakefulness shifts meaning. Cost is somewhat muted—she does not sleep, but gains companionship and purpose without visible forfeiture. The causality from rain trails to museum to brooch to Theo is clean, though Theo's arrival at the exact convergence moment leans coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Vera's descent accumulates sensory and conceptual pressure (singing cave, overlapping shadows, everyday visions magnified) that reweights her life's pursuit in the final image—she now honors present magic over future prophecy, a stance shift with felt cost (thirty years of missed miracles). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (clairvoyant at cottage, three days after pilgrim). The pilgrim's arrival and death function as inciting setup but feel slightly under-motivated; his blood-map and peaceful smile are told convenience rather than earned causality, preventing full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates absences and salvaged fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elena accepts her role as keeper of loss. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elena, Ivory Harbor, Archive). The closure—Elena lighting her lamp to continue work—crystallizes her stance with visible cost (endless vigil, no personal resolution), but the cost is asserted in reflection ("she could not change what had been lost") rather than dramatized through a present-tense choice that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs when families visit and absences cohere into narratives, reweighting her exile's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—mist, cracks, arrows, and the phantom punch build pressure through layered imagery. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (starlit vault, Clara's profession, midnight threshold). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Clara steps through the door into a space where reconciliation becomes possible, the cost implicit in "thirty years of truth to chart." However, the father's line "I wondered how long the cracks would take to reach you" implies he has been passively waiting rather than the fortress actively selecting seekers, introducing a small causal wobble that doesn't break the design but softens the inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, tower, present evening) land by ~100 words. The closure is a Charged Poise—Mira descends with the journal, still skeptical but carrying "impossible hope"—but the cost is vague: what exactly has she risked or forfeited by transcribing? The lens reads Accumulative (whale song, tiles, symbols layer toward a tonal shift), but the escalation is gentle accumulation without a distinct tightening that narrows options. The journal's seventeen pages are asserted to hold power, not dramatized; we never see consequences of the transcription choice on the page, only Aldric's promise that it will work later.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first 120 words. The drive lens reads as Causal: Vera's intrigue → spatial mutiny crescendo → threshold crossing, with motivated ellipsis. Closure is a Decisive Change (stepping through with the fragment burning away, boredom cracking) with visible cost (the fragment consumed, the escondite abandoned). One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm reaches crescendo and forces the doorway open. The cost is legible on the page ("boredom that had calcified Vera's soul began to crack and fall away"), though the final image leans abstract rather than anchored in a concrete sensory particular.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Orientation is clean (Maya, funeral home, present day established by ~80 words). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maya accepts that "fair trades don't balance. They transform," taking the ink pot with visible cost (Mr. Chen gives up his grandfather's artifact, her father gets something real, Maya finds "her own mathematics"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mr. Chen places the pot in her hands after she reframes the exchange. Cost is legible on the page in the final image and Mr. Chen's "we're even" carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through sensory accumulation and the ritual of dawn-charting, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mei's commitment to her practice is reaffirmed with implicit cost (isolation, the endless climb). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure reweights the opening ritual through "every dawn she had ever collected," charging the notepad's spine with accumulated meaning. One tightening is evident in the progression from observation to the final trace of collected dawns. Cost is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (unnamed survivor), where (port container maze), and when (low tide, tonight) within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: she layers fragments across tides until the overheard conversation about the Meridian reweights all prior material, narrowing her options to direct confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—"tomorrow she would begin again, collecting new fragments"—with the cost felt in her patient, irreducible stance and the glass-pressed label as monument. One meaningful deepening (the Meridian revelation) tightens her investigation into a named target, satisfying the escalation requirement for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered voices and the painted seashell's recurrence until the final image—descending with the shell pressed to her ear—reweights her stance with felt cost (she will return changed, old certainties "whispered shut"). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize, and the cost of inhabiting paradox is undeniable on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One persistent constraint shapes tactics: the cello offers voices she "refused to hear the first time," altering her present reception. Minor causality slip: the seashell grows warm in her pocket without prior cue, a convenience that could have been seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat (Mira at the junction, raft city, privatization threat). Drive lens reads Situational: pressure accumulates through escalating external threat (investors, six-month deadline) and Mira's stance crystallizes in the final image—she will continue bridging despite fear. Closure is Charged Poise: the final moment ("went to find the Marinero elders. There were more bridges to build") reconfigures options with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the meeting hammers out legal structures, narrowing the path from passive resistance to organized response.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery (crater, vial, chemical packets, satellite grid) toward the threshold moment. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the cost of progress and Elena's witness role. However, the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a hard forfeiture or decision that alters her options. The chemical packets rupture on timers, not through her agency, which softens the closure's felt price. One meaningful deepening is present, but the ending hovers at poise without a decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by the opening paragraphs). The story follows a causal lens: merchant arrives with broken drone → Elara diagnoses and repairs → maiden voyage proceeds. One meaningful tightening occurs (harbor bells mark time pressure), and closure lands on-page with the ship departing and Elara returning to her shop. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt—no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; she simply succeeds and waits for the next customer. The ending reconfigures her stance as an ongoing pattern but lacks the decisive change or charged poise that would elevate closure under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal elements. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Maren walks north toward an unmapped source, trusting that "finding it would be enough"—a crystallized stance that forecloses return with felt cost (the twelve-day instruction to Volkov, the physical risk). The piece deepens through recurring condensation/water imagery that reweights meaning at the end. One meaningful tightening occurs when the falcon's return confirms the brief window, narrowing her options and forcing immediate departure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through ritual repetition (three days of walking patterns, bell restoration) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where the town "falls like a seed." Closure lands on the page—Veradhen's graceful collapse and the granddaughter's return ninety years later—with conceptual cost (the town must die to be reborn). Orientation anchors early (bell tuner, Veradhen, three days before collapse), and the pattern of footsteps → bells → collapse coheres under the accumulative lens, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Marina ascends with an empty vial, transforming from proof-seeker to witness-carrier, the cost visible in her abandoned career validation. The causal chain is strong—distress signal → temple discovery → memory encounter → choice to release → ascent with testimony. Orientation anchors quickly (underwater temple, Marina, diving suit). One minor velocity dip in the middle expository block about the priests and memory-vials, but it primes the central stakes and the ending reweights all prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a Causal lens: Milo enters the prison because of his father's death and the hidden letters, confronts the creature, and names it—causing it to shatter. The closure is a Decisive Change (the creature destroyed, Milo now holding proof) with visible cost (he will be found with impossible evidence and must "cry wolf one more time"). Orientation anchors early (lighthouse prison, dusk, Milo at seventeen). One meaningful tightening occurs when the hush-thing appears and Milo must speak through the lattice. The cost is legible in the final paragraph: he has proof but must re-enact his family's dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (pulsing fruit, quicksilver streams, four generations of beads building resonance) and delivers Charged Poise at closure: dawn breaks, Maren dissolves, the debt repays with visible cost (her dissolution, the end of her guidance). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The tightening—four beads singing together to trigger the end of night—is motivated by prior accumulation and lands with felt cost (Maren's departure, the world's transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the labyrinth transforms from prison to garden through Meren's stitching, with visible cost in her acceptance that "some ruins could not be mended." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The piece follows a mosaic-adjacent structure (past/present interleaved) that teaches its pattern early and holds the lens through closure. One meaningful deepening occurs as Meren's act breaks tradition with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of descent and discovery early, and the sundial restoration reweights the orchard's meaning with visible action (apples glow, shadows move). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (underground, lantern, catacombs). The closure unit—Mira climbing out with seeds and the base, committed to continuation—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (abandoning skepticism, accepting mystery). One meaningful deepening occurs at the sundial discovery; the week of excavation adds texture but not additional pressure turns.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear ritual structure and coherent world logic. Orientation is anchored early (golden arcade, dawn, Vera's role). However, closure relies on Resonant Reconfiguration (the ritual continuing, Vera returning tomorrow), but no felt cost is legible on the page—the letter is mailed, Elena Marginal will exist, and Vera will repeat the cycle. The final image ("Until then, Vera would return each dawn...") declares continuity rather than reweighting prior material with visible sacrifice or narrowed options. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive intensification or cadence shift occurs at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with situational pressures: Mira overhears conspiracy fragments, recognizes the pattern in her embroidery, and decides to act. Closure is Charged Poise—she completes the warning panel and prepares to carry it, crystallizing the stakes with felt cost (risk of exposure). Orientation anchors early (observatory, autumn, Mira at work). One tightening occurs when she sees "the complete conspiracy" and understands the purge's scope. Cost is implied rather than dramatized on the final page, which keeps this in the 7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (medium, boat, mangrove labyrinth) by the opening beat. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: condensation spelling unsent words, spirits as witnesses, moonlight as recurring anchor. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to release): Celeste speaks the apology, receives her mother's reply through condensation, and rows home with "steady" hands—a visible shift from paralysis to agency. Cost is legible: twenty years of silence ending, the shard pressed to her lips as both relic and forgiveness token. The piece coheres under its lens and delivers closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The dominant stake—Marina seeking release from carried trauma—tightens when she encounters the smudged cast and decides to decrypt it, narrowing her options from passive waiting to active translation with a mercy-driven alteration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina's decision to discard the coral is crystallized on the page, the final image reweights "healing was just another form of translation," and the cost (relinquishing the calcified reminder) is felt. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection, the cast-decryption beat, and the final coral decision, with cadence shift at the ending reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Mira enters the fog-bound ruins, works on her mural, and experiences a shift in understanding. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first several paragraphs without clear spatial grounding by ~120 words, triggering a −0.3 penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira resolves to return and continue her practice, reweighting her relationship to art. However, the cost is largely conceptual and the final image ("she would continue to heal the breach") leans on summary rather than a concrete on-page moment that makes the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a Situational/Accumulative lens: pressure builds through repeated restoration attempts until the question itself becomes the activating frequency. Orientation anchors promptly (sound wave garden, Margot Chen, mural restorer). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the portrait reveals itself as a participatory artifact requiring wonder as its key, reweighting Margot's role from expert to co-participant. The cost is legible: she must exchange certainty for curiosity, and the panel's return to emptiness signals the transformation's irreversibility. One substantive deepening occurs when the question, not assertion, triggers the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads Situational: the Bureau's surveillance creates coherent pressure that forces Marcus and Sofia toward the encoded-garden stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image ("the seed, the scholar, and the slow patient work") crystallizes their defiant commitment with felt cost (patience, secrecy, long timeline). One meaningful tightening occurs when Sofia reaches for the seed. Minor cost-legibility issue: the conceptual price of discovery or failure remains abstract rather than viscerally on the page, capping the band shy of 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (shell as dwelling/library/hospital, verses as sustenance, lullabies as armistice) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Minerva "finally understood what her mother had meant"—beauty as built, not found. The closure reweights the galaxy postcard and the mother's gift with visible cost (centuries of longing transmuted). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One tightening occurs when the narrative moves from personal survival to communal refuge, narrowing her stance from flight to sanctuary-builder. The cost is legible: sleeplessness, perpetual grief, and the transformation of sorrow into nourishment for others.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (glass-orchid caretaker, opal library, "today"). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the cracked tube seals, names take root in orchids, deserted marvels become "less deserted") with felt cost visible in Mira's tears and the acknowledgment that foxglove regret will always bloom. The accumulative design—stacks of extinct feelings, corridors of glass orchids, the restoration ritual—coheres and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake (preservation of forgotten names). One meaningful deepening is present when the song gathers strength and the names emerge, narrowing the library's desolation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): mutual promises voiced, silence broken, work begun together—options narrow from divergence to collaboration with felt relational cost. Drive lens is Causal with lyric texture: Maren's discovery of Veth'ari → invitation → mutual confession → decision to translate together. One meaningful tightening (the voiced promises) reconfigures the sibling relationship. Orientation anchors (archive, Maren POV, tonight-before-tomorrow timeframe) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. Cost is emotional and relational, legible in "I blamed you…I couldn't bear to blame myself."

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: discovery → decoding → realization → renewed purpose. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira decides to defer revelation until she can ensure the villages' safety, a stance that forecloses immediate justice with a visible moral cost. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph), and the surveyor's chain functions as both cipher key and thematic bridge. The primary weakness is that the climactic turn—her choice to wait—feels like a continuation of her grandmother's silence rather than a sharp reversal, muting the felt cost at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through recurring images (dust motes, meteorite, birds) and deepens from silence to confession. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to nascent trust): Elara's journal entry and the blooming metaphor reconfigure her relationship to secrecy with felt cost—the vulnerability of creating a paper trail after fleeing one. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The cost is legible in "something that had long been withering finally began to bloom," though the exact price (exposure risk, loss of protective anonymity) could be sharper on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira listens without judgment and Elara places the meteorite in her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (prism terrace, logbook codes, butterfly effect) and converges at the violet threshold. Orientation anchors (Wren on the drifting terrace, seventeen years post-disappearance) arrive early enough. The closure—Wren stepping through as her father simultaneously resumes searching—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing reunion with undeniable emotional weight. One causality softness: the father's sudden turn feels synchronized by narrative will rather than motivated ellipsis, introducing a faint coincidence note at the resolution point.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's journey from isolation to shared witness accumulates through images (moon pool, bioluminescent algae, firefly fish) and reaches Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the synchronized exhale and her decision to return reweight the dominant stake with felt cost (leaving behind academic chaos, accepting a slower rhythm). Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The cost is legible in her shift from "I'll stay until sunrise" rather than committing immediately, foreclosing the path of instant resolution while opening a patient one.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (recollectionist, cave, three-day countdown) land by ~15% of text. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira plants seeds and accepts her sister's unknowability, foreclosing the search with felt cost ("grief she would carry forever"). The textural deepening occurs when seeds layer over crater glass, reweighting her sister's emotions from defeat to release. Cost is on the page: she climbs lighter but still carrying grief, and the memory will fade. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of calculated moments building toward a performance that blurs order and chaos. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image ("who was leading") reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the audience's wonder is engineered, not organic). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when the unplanned child forces adaptation, though this beat doesn't narrow options as much as demonstrate Marina's flexibility. Cost is present but oblique: the story makes legible that Marina's art depends on sustained illusion, yet the felt price of this stance remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure lands on the page—Kira is transformed, the cosmic verse gleams, and the cost (permanent exile from the provinces) is stated and felt. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the ritual follows because/therefore logic while the final image reweights "exile as homecoming." One friction: the escalation from Kira's arrival to her transformation compresses too quickly, eliding the intermediate struggle that would deepen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Elena accepts the atrium's loss and commits to scattered works, reweighting permanence versus transience with visible cost. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—the stone-ripple beat, prism-light description, and noctilucent clouds build density toward the final notebook sketch that reweights her seventeen-year investment. One meaningful deepening (demolition forces stance crystallization) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through reflection anchored to the present climb and the box, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (scattering ashes while keeping the cracked box) with visible cost (final surrender of physical remains). Orientation is clean: who, where, when established early. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—Marcus releases the ashes but retains the box, forecloses reunion while accepting the scar. One tightening deepening occurs when he shifts from paralysis to understanding the crack as marker rather than diminishment. The lens holds; causality is maintained through memory-triggered realization.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Marina, grotto, three months post-diagnosis). The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina arranges beads, watches timelines brighten, identifies a pattern pointing to Geneva, then resolves to act. One meaningful tightening occurs when the triangle configuration consistently brightens survival timelines, narrowing her next move. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she exits with determination and a concrete plan, options reconfigured by the grotto's data—but the cost remains implicit (hope recalculated, not a visible forfeiture on the page). The final image gestures toward future action rather than landing a decisive present change or legible sacrifice, keeping closure in the RR zone but at the threshold of full cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The discovery sequence builds through layered reveals (diaries → film negative → sensor readings → final understanding) that reweight the opening question about what walls dream. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the realization that "walls did not dream of the past...they dreamed of exactly this moment," with conceptual cost visible in the burden of legacy Mira accepts. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film negative shows Helena's identical gesture, tightening the generational link and charging the final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraphs (terrace, rain, spring, vespers timeframe). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and reflection build toward a final image rather than causal turns. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the painting's shimmer and the painter's departure, but cost remains abstract—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price undeniable. The "borrowed heartbeat" backstory and the coded lullabies are told in reflective summary, weakening the sense of stakes tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story patterns callbacks (clipboard, wildflowers, twin shadows) and deepens through Elara's choice to "keep paying," a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis. Cost is legible: forty-three years, seventeen failures, and the weight of names. Orientation anchors quickly (ancient terrace, midsummer, Elara's role). However, the closure reconfiguration is more stated ("Redemption...was not a single payment") than crystallized in a charged final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The treaty signing itself feels ceremonial rather than a decisive tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through Eleanor's reflection on the drought, her guilt, and extinct species, then crystallizes in the act of placing the egg and activating the speaker—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options and stakes are reweighted. The cost is conceptual and felt: she performs a futile gesture knowing it changes nothing, forecloses any hope of redemption, and walks away. One tightening is evident and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the prism ritual gathers echoes and reweights Meridia's solitude into inherited company. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening lines. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (she walks back carrying an "army" of voices with a plan to teach), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid for the harvest. The transformation "happened between sigh and smile" elides the pivotal beat where grief becomes gratitude, weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Situational/Accumulative: the argument's aftermath creates a crystallized moment where both characters reweigh their stances through the puppet show and dust-writing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the question mark beside the listening symbol reconfigures their opposition into collaborative inquiry with felt relational cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus performs the meta-puppet show, narrowing emotional distance and forcing Vera to confront her own methods.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through density of image and ritual action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Vera accepts that witness, not salvation, is the work. Orientation anchors early (grotto, mountainside, seven-day climb). The closure lands with cost: she dismantles her structures, presses the wing back into her notebook, and commits to continuing this thankless labor. One meaningful deepening occurs when the monarchs pause at the structures, validating her grandmother's theory and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Elin becomes "the mold and the metal both," the rope holds its new pattern, and she releases the punched card to dust—visible cost that forecloses return to her old methods. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered objects (wax model, punched card, rope, aurora) and the final cadence shift ("The aurora faded. The ice sang with names.") reweights the stake with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Elin, ice sanctum, aurora, lost wax caster). One tightening suffices: the rope reconfiguration narrows her method and the melody's emergence crystallizes the transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mira descends, discovers the seal, breaks it, receives visions, and emerges transformed. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she steps into uncertainty rather than control), and the cost is conceptual—she carries "broken proof" and relinquishes mastery. The tightening is meaningful: the seal-break floods her with understanding that reweights her approach. One deduction: the cost is stated rather than dramatized in a final image that makes loss undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through translation and observation accumulates toward the decoded sequence. Orientation anchors (Mira, Babylon palace, interregnum twilight) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraphs. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Mira completes her covenant, accepts marginalization, and commits to seventeen years of waiting—a renunciation that forecloses immediate validation with felt cost. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the sequence simply emerges as predicted, making the escalation more confirmatory than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (Mireva, sanctuary, soundless space) and holds a Causal lens through the cellular memory mechanism that unlocks Thorne's ancestral peace. Closure arrives on the page: Thorne unclenches his fists and chooses release, a Decisive Change with visible cost (foregoing vengeance, taking the broken box as a new symbol). However, the turn is enacted by Mireva's intervention rather than Thorne's own causal choices; the "because/therefore" chain runs through her magic touch, not his resistance or negotiation. One meaningful tightening occurs when he recognizes the music box and feels his lineage, but the cost—dishonoring his mother's memory—is asserted rather than dramatized as a live dilemma he wrestles with on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara breaks synchronization, asserting the boundary she has spent seventeen years trying to dissolve, with the cost felt in her renunciation of immediate crossing. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—fog, mirrors, breath, and frost accumulate density until the sextant moment reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (mirror maker, fog-lost orchard, seventeen years) arrive early. One meaningful deepening when she realizes the dream was calling, not fleeing, narrows her stance and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a clear Causal lens: climb → discovery of journal → decision to teach, with the breach of contract and daughter's foresight motivating the archive's existence. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to renewed commitment) with visible cost: Mira relinquishes the ribbon, foreclosing solitary mourning and accepting the deciduous cycle. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs. One small cost-legibility question: the "months" of grief mentioned late could have been signaled earlier to charge the laughter beat more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the orchard's pattern accumulates and the final carving gesture reweights the inheritance motif. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "between the first and last page" remains opaque until the reflection explains it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren begins carving the cameo, crystallizing her curator role, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically paid on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing in the final beats. One meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps nonlinear inheritance, yet the breakthrough arrives via exposition rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the opening paragraphs). The causal chain—diary coordinates → gap research → speaking to the mountain → Thessaly's release—holds under a Causal lens. The closure delivers a Decisive Change (Thessaly emerges, they leave together) with cost legible in "three years of lessons" and the mountain's hopefulness. One escalation turn (understanding the mountain rescues rather than traps) meaningfully tightens options. The time traveler's arrival functions as complication but his exposition about seventeen versions feels like scaffold rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fog, carnival decay, the emerald swatch building toward a lyric reconfiguration). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the sisters choosing remembrance, but the cost remains asserted ("chosen to be remembered") rather than dramatically legible—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price undeniable. The sister's solidity shift ("hand grew solid") tells rather than shows the stakes crystallizing. Causality holds, but closure lacks the sharp before/after with felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: door appears → seal discovered → connection understood → rope untangled → bell rings. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure delivers a Decisive Change (the mechanism is restored, the door becomes permanent) with conceptual cost visible in the final image—Mira has altered the university's hidden architecture. However, the escalation is more procedural than pressured; Mira encounters no meaningful resistance or risk while untangling the rope, reducing the felt cost of the transformation. The linkage holds but the tightening is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Vera plants herself in the eye of the storm with visible cost—she cannot stop the beings but claims territory worth holding. The accumulative lens holds throughout; each descent beat tightens spatial options until the bloom chamber crystallizes all prior pressure. Orientation anchors immediately (mapkeeper, caves, three months post-arrival) and causality remains tight: ice spiral → gap → new chamber → stone response → mapping decision. Cost is legible in her shift from solo refuge-seeker to guide for the overwhelmed.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira waiting at the beacon with the alignment overhead and survivors beginning their journey constitutes a reconfiguration of her custodial role with the conceptual cost of stepping into prophecy's fulfillment. The causal lens holds cleanly through vision → understanding → rekindling → alignment, though the coincidental timing (finding the prism three days before the foretold night) edges toward convenience. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision shifts to show tonight's date, narrowing her window and forcing immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density, pattern (crystal voices, shadow, storm), and cadence shift build to a Conceptual Repricing at closure—"identity they had chosen rather than inherited" reweights the premise with social cost (her people's certainty dissolves). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by paragraph two. The single-POV, two-shard structure (ascent/descent) with one transition fits scope. Weakness: the closure cost is conceptual and future-facing; we do not see an on-page forfeiture or immediate price paid in the final image, only her decision to descend with pages.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the portcullis). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grief → walking → mosaic message → tower reunion → fireworks display → renewed purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother reframes the kerosene knot, though this arrives via coincidence (her unexpected presence) rather than Elara's agency. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed stance: "she would walk again, chanting, carrying fire"), but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page—what exactly has she forfeited or transformed?

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—the pause between question and answer accumulates density through layered reflection, then releases into Charged Poise when Elena touches the cicada and offers to learn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (mother and daughter begin emergence) with felt cost (years of absence acknowledged, path of slow repair). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening tightens the dominant stake (estrangement versus reconnection) through tangential answer that reweights prior material at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered silences (bunker, meadow, city, gilded hush) that reweight Mira's stance. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she defers the bunker return and commits to sideways growth, crystallizing options with felt cost (avoidance acknowledged). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The inversion hour provides a tightening that deepens her commitment without requiring a dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring acoustic imagery and the storm-glass pattern toward a final cadence shift when Eris releases the crystals and the terrace's silence transforms. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the new quiet "opens, like a door held wide" with conceptual cost legible in the vial's dissolution and Eris's deliberate intervention. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words cleanly. The tightening is subtle but present: weeks of monitoring converge in tonight's helix pattern, compelling the release.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (lore keeper, waterfall, orchard, sunrise deadline) land early. The story follows a causal lens: ruby flake guides → murals reveal → tree opens → ascent begins. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bark becomes translucent, narrowing options to "climb now or lose the chance." Cost is present but muted—Meridia leaves the orchard and her old role, yet the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The closure is a Decisive Change (lore keeper becomes claimant), but the final image leans toward promise rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's realization that "some bridges...could only be transformed into doorways" crystallizes her stance and reweights the sanctuary's purpose, with the cost legible in the disturbed emptiness and the rebuilt, thinner threshold. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (charred sanctuary, doorknocker unused for three years, fading threshold, scars as map) and the final image reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is anchored early (Mira, sanctuary, tonight). One meaningful tightening: the threshold fades, Sera arrives, Mira opens the door—each beat narrows options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs (Vera, underground bunker, 3:47 AM during dimensional thinning). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through escalating manifestations (violet glow → seventeen shadows → concepts materializing → quantum doorway) until the final transformation reconfigures the premise. Closure lands on the page as Conceptual Repricing—diamonds crystallize trauma into proof—with felt cost (trembling fingers, voluntary re-exposure to parallel trauma). One meaningful deepening occurs when Vera channels pressure into the soil, transforming suffering into structure. The causal chain is present but relies heavily on fantastical mechanics that are asserted rather than earned through prior groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Margaret pieces together meaning through reflection, the gramophone ritual, and the journal's revelations. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. However, the closure effect—Margaret's decision to "begin" learning standing waves—feels more like stated intention than a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the story tells us something "quieter, something more honest" is ready to begin, but we don't see a path foreclosed or a live option transformed on the page. The revelations about the Ashworth fortune arrive through summary rather than dramatized discovery, weakening causal pressure at the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the greenhouse setting, the program's symbols, and the golden threads build density toward the final image of a new star and Aldric's transformation. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, Aldric, endless night) appear early. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Aldric moves from armored withdrawal to vessel—but the cost remains implied rather than undeniable on the page; no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the transformation is more epiphanic than causally tight. One meaningful deepening occurs when reality shifts and he removes his armor, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (file room, Eleanor, present action of pulling folders). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the 1867 file deepens the pattern Eleanor has been tracing, then the button discovery crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). The final image—"she would never stop looking"—reweights the opening dust-reading with undeniable cost: her heartbreak is permanent, yet her devotion persists. The closure lands on the page with felt cost; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Causality is clean within the accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain—message arrives, Mira acts, documents are uploaded—but the closure lacks felt cost. She succeeds completely: files distributed, enforcers fooled, job retained, truth spreading. The "holding the line" frame suggests Earned Stasis, but no path is visibly foreclosed; she gains everything without trade-off. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by the lagoon opening). The lens reads as Causal with light Situational shading, but the ending deflates pressure rather than crystallizing it with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through imagery, backstory layering, and musical performance toward a final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she refuses to pass the prophecy and forecloses that path. Orientation is clear (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The cost, however, is asserted rather than felt on the page: "felt the prophecy shatter" tells the reader the outcome without showing a visceral moment of resistance or loss that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean: who, where, what by the first beat. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered images (seeds, leaves, monuments, dust speck) that converge in the hush. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Wren's perceptual shift reweights her life's work, and the final monument marks the transformation. Cost is felt (she is no longer "ordinary") but remains oblique; the forfeit of her former self is asserted more than dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf's patterns rearrange, narrowing her understanding and opening transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the waterfall reveal. The closure—Mira carrying the compass and logbook, committing to build a probability timepiece—lands as Conceptual Repricing: her old belief in precision is reweighted by the admiral's honesty and the spinning needle. Cost is felt (thirty years of conviction abandoned) but not dramatized in a single decisive beat; the piece accumulates pressure through descent, discovery, and the admiral's wisdom, then crystallizes in her climb back. One meaningful deepening occurs when she digs up the logbook and decides to improvise. Causality is intact; coincidence (the dead client's map) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors immediately (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's work through the night accumulates pressure through repeated motifs (the coin, her father's name, the kintsugi concept) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration—the metal's imperfect sheen reweights her father's legacy from pure shame to "golden seams." The cost is conceptual and relational (names shift weight, dead apprentices are "remembered differently"), legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening through the alchemical work suffices at this length, though the turn could press harder if an earlier choice had foreclosed a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the harp's distorted notes trigger a pattern of spectral confessions that reweight Maren's understanding of her centuries of work. Orientation anchors (lost soul collector, Echo Gorge, dawn) arrive by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (purpose restored through reweighted meaning) with visible cost: "The ache remained, but now it glowed." One meaningful deepening occurs when the spirits reveal her forgotten gift, narrowing her search inward and foreclosing the path of self-doubt. Causality is clean; the harp encounter motivates the revelation, which motivates the decision to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a stance crystallization). Orientation anchors—Elena in the ultraviolet forest after escape—arrive within the opening lines. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elena buries the mask strap and commits to rewriting the equations, crystallizing her stance with the cost of remaining hunted and alone. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page trade-off or forfeiture makes the price undeniable in the final image, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments of grandmother's legacy accumulate toward the final retrieval and vision. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Mira crosses from "between childhood and now" to "simply here" with the lens fragment warming her palm and a vision of layered histories. Cost is felt (commitment to a life in between-spaces) but rendered somewhat abstractly. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (market, dusk, Mira's purpose). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragment is found and retrieved, reweighting the stake from search to inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Miriam encounters the ghost, discovers the mainspring, learns Eleanor's story, and commits to remembering her name. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Miriam sitting with "the weightless burden" reweights the premise with felt cost—she carries the responsibility of witnessing—but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. Orientation is clear early; the single continuous scene with brief reflective anchors holds coherent pressure through to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (glass orchard library, Maren, letterpress, perpetual sunrise). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (frost patterns, bottled whisper, glass trees) and a single decisive action (pulling the lever) triggers the closure. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (library descends, Maren begins gathering type with new purpose) with conceptual cost legible in "disrupted perfection" and the destroyed press. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frost completes its pattern and Maren acts. Cost could be sharper—the consequences feel primarily atmospheric rather than foregrounding a lived price.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights the baroque asteroid from tomb to doorway, charging Maren's revolutionary fire with new purpose. Orientation anchors quickly (baroque asteroid, temporal storms, Maren's quarters). The escalation deepens through the theory formation and mirror-uncovering, then the step-through delivers visible cost (abandoning her research, the academic council's future debates). One weak seam: the transition from hypothesis to action feels compressed—the because/therefore linkage between "writing in verse" and "uncovering the mirror" lacks one intermediate beat of doubt or hesitation that would make the cost feel heavier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands clearly as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias disperses the light into seven mechanisms, forecloses resurrection, and accepts forward flow with visible cost (the chip dims to nothing). The causal lens holds: grandmother's note → puzzle over "mend what isn't torn" → recognition of invisible wound → wilting dishonesty → corrected intention → dispersal. Orientation is swift (chamber, workbench, chip present by paragraph three). One micro turn (the wilting check) tightens before the final dispersion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (petrichor collector, limestone descent, chromium plant context). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory detail, psychometry vision, and bioluminescent pattern until the final moment reweights her quest with the word "welcome" and her choice to stay. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she stops seeking return, forecloses the surface world, with cost legible in "no longer looking for the way back." One meaningful deepening (compass vision → lagoon transformation → acceptance) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens (storm → shelter → slide revelation → new purpose) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina's stance shifts from lost sculptor to alliance participant. However, the closure cost is conceptual and asserted ("carrying centuries of partnership") rather than felt through a specific forfeiture or constraint visible in the final image. The slide's revelation unfolds through description rather than a decision that narrows options. Orientation anchors quickly (archway, storm, Marina), but the middle escalation (lightning alignments revealing layers) reads as discovery without Marina's agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (pavilion, Mira, postcards, autumn-to-spring). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered glass study, weekly observation, and the mural's expansion. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the mural becomes a sanctuary, visitors recognize themselves) with conceptual cost visible in the grandmother's secret midnight wanderings and Mira's ongoing commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira grasps the innermost layer's human figure and reweights the flower question. Light causality slippage: the leap from glass study to full thematic understanding feels slightly unearned, and the visitors' arrival/response is summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is legible: Celeste moves from solitary decoder to bridge for silenced voices, fulfilling the archival mission with a palpable shift in responsibility. The piece infers a Causal lens by midpoint (diary → visions → coordinates → lagoon → parley) and holds it through the ending. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (floating library, zeppelin, dunes). The final image—carrying voices that "refused to stay encrypted"—reconfigures her role with conceptual cost, though the emotional or tactical price remains abstract rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—villagers returning, drawn by memory-lanterns—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the shift from magic-dependence to self-recognition with felt cost (exile ending, the village reimagined). One tightening occurs when Mira accesses the bottle's memories and reframes the fisherman's wish, narrowing her task from restoration to transformation. Cost is conceptual and social (the community's old identity dissolved), legible in the image of people walking back "illuminated by the glow of their own preserved memories," though the price for Mira herself remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered ritual action, memory, and symbolic pattern (falling apples, glowing wax). Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—Maren recognizes her archival work as preparation rather than preservation, reweighting her profession's purpose. The cost is conceptual (her role transforms from scribe to junction point) rather than a visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors early (orchard, tower, 3:47 AM), and the foghorn brackets the window cleanly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wax shaving glows and she speaks the future, but the lack of a visible obstacle or trade-off keeps this in the high-7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren's final placement of the acorn cap and readiness to guide seeds into spring crystallize her acceptance of the inheritance with conceptual cost (centuries of waiting compressed into one custodian's duty). Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (frozen atrium, Maren as seed saver, three days post-hatching). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, holding through the ending's density increase and cadence shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vortex descends and floods her with ancestral memories, reweighting her purpose. Causality remains stable; the method (resonance, acorn cap geometry) enables the transformation without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (sanctuary, Mira, present-tense observation) land within the opening paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: solstice convergence and microclimate equilibrium create density increase that reweights the dominant stake (learning when warning becomes listening). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bell-pull crystallizes her shift from alarm to acknowledgment with visible cost—her professional identity reweighted. One meaningful deepening (instrument readings converge → zero hour → bell pull) is sufficient for this length, and the cost is legible in the keepers' bow and her return to humble recording.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when within opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: stardust sweeping → lantern ritual → dawn descent forms a coherent pattern with cadence shift at closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mira's refusal to leave is reweighted through the final image of lantern glow and shared vigil. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the world's trajectory) but legible in "waiting for a world that had forgotten how to look up." One meaningful deepening (meteor as arrival, not failure) tightens the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (scorched wasteland, cottage, Maren, post-ghost-visibility world). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the mother-ghost encounter deepens the pattern established by the grandmother, and the final image reweights "silence" as both burden and communion with visible cost (Maren holding undelivered words, choosing patience over release). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options crystallize around whether to deliver the words, and the weight of preserved silences charges the ending. One persistent constraint (the stained glass box as container) shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds meaning through layered discovery (fragment → hologram → garage sale listings → Elena's method) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera commits to continuing Elena's work. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure reweights Vera's borrowed time from debt to vocation with felt cost (seventeen years dedicated to an invisible, patient archive), and the lens holds. One tightening occurs when the fragment unlocks the capsule's true purpose, narrowing Vera's options to a single, essential role.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is legible: the mended kite rising with the feather reweights the "incomplete" motif established by Mira's grandmother and the smudged notebook, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (Mira's willingness to give away the found object). The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image crystallizes the pattern of "woven dawns" and "beauty in broken things." One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira uses the feather, transforming her private philosophy into shared action. The causality is clean: storm → feather → boy's kite breaks → Mira mends → kite flies with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren's systematic work with copper wire deepens across weeks and months, building toward the orchard's transformation. Orientation is clean (island, temple orchard, terminal diagnosis) by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Maren's palm on the pillar and her smile as she waits to join the slow conversation—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharply legible; we infer peace but don't witness a specific path foreclosed or a visible price paid in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes Mira's skeptical frame, accumulates sensory and conceptual density around the amber, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (luminous certainty replacing skepticism) in the final third. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure cost is felt—Mira's academic rebelliousness is implicitly renounced—but the exact on-page sentence where this foreclosure becomes undeniable is diffuse across the descent paragraphs rather than crystallized in a single image. The "ready to tell them yes" gesture closes the loop but reads slightly summary rather than a charged decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Erasmus stands alone on the blooming jetty, "tending a garden that existed mostly in the future," with the cost undeniable in his isolation and the open-ended commitment. The accumulative lens is taught early (reef's dissolution → flower growth → seed dispersal ritual) and held through the final image, which reweights the opening phosphorescent flowers and seed collection. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reef's generous decay feeds resurrection, shifting the stake from mere ritual to ecological resurrection with visible cost (his years, his solitude, the uncertain outcome).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change: Marta shifts from searching for the dead to following the living, with the map providing concrete new options and the eastward walk forecloses her settled life. Causality is clean—Ven's discovery → riddle → memory → compost pit → map. Orientation is swift (bloodhound, scrapyard, post-war by line three). The inferred lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture; linkage holds and cost is visible in her gathering "the last of her courage."

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's ritual sketching deepens across three years of solitude, and the arriving ship reweights her practice without disrupting it. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the third paragraph. The closure—Mira continuing her sketch as the ship approaches, choosing documentation over rescue—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (prolonged isolation, deferred human contact). One structural concern: the extensive backstory (shutdown, evacuation, her initial breakdown)占s roughly 30% of the text and flattens present-scene momentum, though it does prime the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal support. Orientation anchors clearly (violet sky, Spire, dying master) by the second paragraph. The chess-puzzle structure provides a meaningful tightening that narrows options, and the letter reweights Corwin's entire apprenticeship with conceptual cost (he was never a prisoner). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost on the page—yet the cost remains largely emotional rather than forfeiting a live tactical option, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (footstep-spelling, missing pawns, carved replacements) and a cadence shift at the end when Vera walks out rather than circles again. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): she unbinds from the performance loop, restores the board, and begins her true work; cost is legible in the forfeited drill income and the solitary winter of carving. Orientation anchors cleanly (whispering gallery, interregnum, Vera alone) by the second paragraph. One tightening deepens when she walks her own name, signaling the turn from memorial-keeper to self-liberator.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vera climbs toward the peak carrying stone and feather, the act of returning to buried parts now legible as continuous work rather than destination. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—each night's tracing deepens pattern and stakes—with clean escalation through the feather discovery (night 47) and the hundred-night speech. Cost is felt ("finally whole enough to hurt") and the image of upward motion reconfigures the premise. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 100 words (who, where, when). One minor gap: the bookstore's sentience ("The bookstore noticed") introduces agency late without prior cue, creating a small causal wobble that does not break closure but blurs the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Marcus, village square, post-exile, with backstory woven through present perception. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting into release): dropping the knight reweights his guilt, and time resuming confirms the cost—his three-year exile resolved by acceptance rather than erasure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through sensory hush, thread-decoding, and the labyrinth's metaphoric density, then releases in the mirrored centerpiece. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus stops running and looks up, and the final image (flour drifting, swing creaking) reconfigures the frozen village's meaning. Cost is oblique but felt: he walks away "no longer exiled from himself," having traded his need for external absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers detail (towers, echoes, names, poets in shadow) toward a cadence shift at the ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "a complete woman, complicated and unflattened, forgiven without being diminished" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (Elders' authority dissolved, unprecedented absorption). Orientation anchors early; one meaningful deepening (Sera speaks seven truths, not one) coheres under the lens. The cost is conceptual and social rather than visceral, but undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening graph. The piece reads under an Accumulative lens: Vera's ritualized narration deepens pressure through matched pockmarks until the key ring shatters and golden light transforms the workspace—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where cost is legible (the charm's destruction, the daughter's absence made purposeful). One meaningful tightening (the deepest pockmark → unspoken loss) narrows options and reweights the workshop's survival. Closure lands on the page with felt cost and cadence shift, satisfying the length expectation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Edwin, birthday morning, coast). The cave discovery and painting session accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: Edwin sees his daughter's face merged with the light, understands why he painted the quay, and accepts fragmentation as method rather than failure—Earned Stasis with visible cost (he returns to the quay, the colors will run out). One meaningful deepening occurs when his hands reveal what his heart had hidden. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of mortality and the promise kept "until his colors finally ran out."

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story accretes pressure through sensory details (heat wave, dead birds, night-garden scent) and the vial cork as a charged object, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's quiet listening manifests the boy and she offers him both witness and release. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, after heat breaks). The closure lands on-page with felt cost—Mira takes on the burden of tending this ghost-child, foreclosing her solitude—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent intensifies and the boy appears, reweighting Mira's vigil into active care.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors early (station, Tuesday, post-hydraulic failure) and builds coherent pressure through the midnight calls and Mira's accumulating understanding. The closure—Mira completing the beacon and recognizing her own voice—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her grief work crystallizes into ongoing purpose. The causal lens holds: phone clues → chart plotting → beacon construction → recognition of self-as-caller. Cost is visible in her raw hands and transformed relationship to loss, though the future-self twist introduces a minor causality wrinkle that prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Maren shifts from isolation to dangerous dissemination, reweighting psychological safety from solitude to choice. The inferred lens is Causal (smuggled eye → ability to lie → decision to spread cure), though backstory occupies ~35% and occasionally flattens present pressure. Orientation anchors promptly (ravine, platform, Tuesday). The tightening is meaningful: receiving the relic → testing it → drafting instructions narrows her world from passive survival to active risk. Cost is felt in "dangerous work" and the execution threat, though the final pivot happens in summary rather than a dramatized beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias accepts his role as witness-keeper by writing the stranger's truth and committing to deliver it, foreclosing solitary drift with visible cost (the journey to come, the burden of another's grief). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through counted gaps, memory fragments, and the mist's thickening until the final act of inscription reweights his isolation into purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, three days post-logbook arrival). One small friction: the leap from pressed flower to full backstory memory feels slightly convenient, though the "borrowed memory" rule covers it.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: map discovery → matrix chip recognition → cavern descent → doorway revelation. Orientation anchors (Eleanor, her shop, the present investigation) land cleanly within the opening. The closure operates as Charged Poise—Eleanor makes a decision at the threshold, and the abandoned shop with the annotated map demonstrates a before/after with felt cost (she left her known life). The weeks-later frame functions as micro-turn setup rather than evasion, though the actual moment of crossing or turning back remains off-page, which slightly softens the immediacy of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the queen descends with clarified purpose, the final lines crystallizing her new stance ("some truths, buried long enough, become weapons") with felt cost—acknowledging her cowardice/survival and the upcoming confrontation. Causal lens holds: dream → climb → oracle's prodding → memory recovery → descent with intent. One meaningful tightening (the recovered memory) narrows options decisively. Orientation anchors (queen, ridge base, post-warning timeframe) arrive cleanly within the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece anchors quickly (Mira, nexus, pocket-sun, twilight) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density accrues through shell-work, Theo's entrance, the mother-wound glance, and the final reweighting of "presence as participation." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (a conceptual repricing of her life's work), but the cost—giving Theo the shell, leaving differently—remains somewhat abstract and asserted rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when Theo names the trap/attention split, shifting Mira's stance, which suffices for this length under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Vera, ranger cabin, post-grave discovery). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Vera's understanding deepens through layered reflection on scrolls, building to "the chaos was the narrative" realization. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she stops fleeing temporal confusion and commits to writing toward her known ending. The cost is legible: she accepts living between versions of herself, foreclosing the option of linear certainty. One micro-concern: the grave discovery happened three weeks prior, creating slight temporal distance from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean by the first two paragraphs. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fog imagery, water-clock dripping, and the screw mechanism all recur with shifted weight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Margaret accepts her inheritance and Elena returns to her work; the cost is Margaret's tears and the recognition that healing is witnessing, not fixing. The final image reweights the premise coherently. One meaningful deepening (the screw's metaphoric freight) tightens the dominant stake without a causal reversal, appropriate for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The ritual structure—pouring tea, tracing runes, shedding ice—creates a pattern that deepens through the grandmother's superstition and finally reweights at closure when Mira drinks the third cup and commits to teaching others. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final moment crystallizes her stance ("the space between terrors was not empty—it was where the real work began") with felt cost (she will return to explain what contradicts her mentor's teaching). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she stops fighting the ice and draws the transformation rune directly onto it, narrowing her options from resistance to integration.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes clear anchors (archive, Marcus, Eleanor) early and follows a causal sequence: Marcus arrives, Eleanor manifests, the electromagnetic ritual succeeds, Eleanor is freed. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Marcus carries out both demon and dream, walks into "ethereal gray morning," but what has he lost or renounced? The ending gestures toward grace and imperfection but doesn't land a decisive change or charged reconfiguration with on-page price. The orchard destruction arrives as a ticking clock but doesn't constrain the ritual's success or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the blank-dictionary image and the protagonist's new stance, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The spiral-arbitration concept functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows choices. One meaningful deepening occurs (scrolls "softening" into transparent truth), meeting the minimum for this length, but the Cost proof test fails: no single sentence makes the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered images (hydraulic clocks, razor edges, fjord quiet) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Einar's stepping through is Charged Poise, crystallizing the choice between tending clocks as doorways versus remaining ignorant. Cost is legible: he leaves the station, the key, and his known existence. The seventeen-year setup, journal discovery, and counting ritual create a coherent escalation under the accumulative lens, with the final image reweighting all prior clock-tending as threshold work.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (Margot, library, after father's death). The piece follows an accumulative/reflection-led design: no causal reversal occurs, but rather a deepening understanding culminates in her resolve to pay debts and continue research. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of contradiction as her path forward), but the cost is declared rather than dramatized—no on-page choice forecloses an option or exacts a visible price at the ending beat. The structure is two-shard (library frame + subway/textbook discoveries) within the reflection-heavy mode, but the final image ("candle burned steady") asserts rather than charges the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Vera waits for the next call, having redirected one loop, with the cost legible in her continued isolation and the woman's tomorrow still uncertain. Orientation anchors early (booth, tunnel, phone, 7:47). The woman's arc from deletion regret to baby-picture redirection constitutes the meaningful deepening. One slip: the glass disc's "melodically haunted" light effect in paragraph four reads slightly ornamental rather than causally tied to the redirection moment, though it returns purposefully at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: discovery of letters → recognition of pattern → covenant renewal. Orientation anchors late (jetty/harbor/twilight established, but "Archive of Minor Histories" and temporal frame emerge across multiple paragraphs). The closure—Marguerite renewing the covenant and returning to write—constitutes Earned Stasis with Charged Poise, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing occurs. The Keeper's arrival and locket exchange proceed without complication, and the final image ("began to write the covenant anew") restates intent rather than dramatizing a reweighted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Maya, disused station, present-day pursuit). The causal chain holds: Yuen gives sample → Maya tracks Okonkwo → sample completes the protocol → cure exists. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to Charged Poise): Maya's offer to stay forecloses her elusive pattern with felt cost ("unfamiliar and terrifying"). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative accent (the favor-network reveal reweights prior material). One minor slip: the pilot's rumor that led Maya here is never explained—who started it and why remains unearned convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (Meridia, forest, constellation pause). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ultrasonic languages and musical notes build density until the stillpoint's silence reweights the premise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Meridia maps the stillpoint, delivers choice to the dying woman, but herself walks away choosing feeling over neutrality, with visible cost (renouncing future access to equilibrium). One meaningful deepening occurs when the clearing's silence forces her to confront what neutrality means. Cost is legible: she charts escape from feeling, then rejects it.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The drive lens reads as Causal with situational coloring: Vera's original mistake → Kepler response arrives early due to anomaly → she can revise. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (she transmits the correction and observes the star brighten), and cost is present but soft—she gains relief rather than paying a price that forecloses a path. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Kepler question arrives, narrowing her options. The causal chain holds, though the anomaly's convenience slightly undercuts earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence as a recurring motif deepens through Mira's framing, Elena's arrival, and the overnight instruction, culminating in Elena carrying that silence forward. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elena departs armed with new knowledge, the harbor "finally finding an audience"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concrete; we don't see what Elena risks or loses by adopting Mira's vocabulary. The night-long teaching sequence is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the causal chain that should earn the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story employs an accumulative lens: Miriam descends, catalogues visual clues, and arrives at a climactic realization. Orientation anchors adequately (archive, Miriam, post-arson), and the vandalized portrait + letter deliver a Resonant Reconfiguration—she understands her bloodline's legacy. Cost, however, is asserted rather than felt: "The world above had already forgotten her" repeats a prior state rather than showing a fresh forfeiture. The closure reweights her identity but lacks a visible price paid in the final image; the weeping and vow feel like summary rather than a decisive shift that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered sensory description and memory until the drumming sequence releases Elias into the garden. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira completes the transfer and accepts solitude with visible cost ("the loneliness felt different now"). Orientation anchors clearly (Mira, sound wave garden, night). One meaningful deepening occurs when drumming triggers the lagoon response and sculptures release their sounds, reweighting Mira's entanglement into a permanent vessel for Elias's dream.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: Celia follows footsteps → discovers the man → decodes the key-as-template → navigates to the container. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—finding the father's archive—lands on the page with felt emotional cost (the man's grief, Celia's complicity in revealing hidden knowledge). One meaningful tightening occurs when the key's true function is revealed, narrowing the path to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the guardian's patterns build density and cadence through shutter manipulation until the boy's departure reweights the vigil. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she remains, the canal "no longer sounding hungry," and "secrets…better left half-spoken" crystallizes her stance with felt cost. Orientation anchors (cobalt dock, canal, guardian's position) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy shifts attention from water to light patterns, and the cost (ongoing solitary vigil) is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (mist, chess pieces, grotto, starlight) and Eleanor's reflections to build a thematic charge. Closure relies on Charged Poise—Eleanor standing on the library steps, listening to the town's unspoken doubts, affirming "Someone was" and anticipating tomorrow's quiet revelation. Cost is conceptual (risk of failure, the fragility of "hope like a fragile queen") but not viscerally felt or tied to a forfeited option on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening paragraph). The tightening is minimal: preparation → affirmation, with no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options between.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors quickly (sublittoral fringe, Mira's transformation) and tracks a clear causal line: grandmother's deathbed gift → scrimshaw map → whale call → dive. Closure is a Decisive Change (Mira crosses the island threshold), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"chains detach," "freedom" declared—without showing what specific future or relationship she sacrifices. The Treaty's causal role is unclear: it enables her to emerge, yet the story never tests whether violence-as-fear was the true lock on her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the piece accumulates pressure through recurring motifs—turbines, narration, whittling, dried flowers—culminating in a cadence shift at closure). Orientation anchors promptly: wind turbines, farmhouse, Mira, the Happiness Mandate context by ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's rebellion crystallizes as "quiet persistence of continuing," the almost-smile with the flowers watching, reweighting the opening heaviness with felt cost (she remains hollow but has carved space for transformed grief). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Slight deduction: the "remade hush" concept is articulated late and risks thematic echo rather than being fully dramatized as a tactic earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly: quartz contact → tremor of certainty → reading verses → lake cracking → moths arriving builds density and charges the final image. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mora crystallizes her stance against the Council's boundaries, and the environmental response (moths, glowing quartz, cracking ice) makes the conceptual cost—she has irrevocably crossed back—felt on the page. One meaningful deepening (from touching to speaking aloud) suffices at this length, and the escalation is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Mira seeks awakening → trades grief-laden objects → receives color vision → reframes her artistic understanding. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's new sight reweights her artistic purpose with conceptual cost (her prior work may have been "wrong"). The wilted plant arrangement signals sacrifice complete. One meaningful tightening occurs when Theo demands "something that carries genuine loss," narrowing her options and forcing the reed tongue forward.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each recording stations Mira through accumulates density and shifts her understanding of connection. Orientation anchors (Laboratory, three days post-blackout, Mira alone) land cleanly within the opening. The closure—ringing bells with the lens as reminder—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting her stance on connection with the cost implied in "trusting the resonance to find its way home" without demanding response. One deduction: the "artificial pilgrimage" frame is declared but not visibly constrained by the stations; she moves freely without friction or stakes testing her commitment to the route.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors early (observatory, three months post-loss, mourning jewelry maker). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: grief particulars (calloused fingers, eviction notice, empty craft) accumulate pressure until the stencil and cranes shift her stance into teaching. The closure reconfigures Elara's relationship to her daughter's memory ("The thought no longer shattered her. Instead, it illuminated everything"), and the final image of meeting a new visitor charges the pattern with visible continuity cost. Cost is legible but leans oblique—emotional reweighting rather than a decisive forfeiture. The summarized middle (clients arriving, community forming) compresses causal links that would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (loft, rain, Vera's practice). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus's unsolicited reach for the Moon reweights both his stance and Vera's project, crystallizing the question she's "trying to find out" with visible cost (his surrender of control, herMap gaining a new data point). The piece coheres under accumulative pressure: each card choice and Vera's confiding build density until the final reversal. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with atmospheric deepening across the archive discovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately by the opening beats. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing through the "understanding that some knowledge is forbidden not because it destroys, but because it transforms" realization, but this lands as abstract theme statement rather than a final image with legible cost. The purification ritual occupies the climax but its mechanics remain vague ("words in random sequences"), weakening causal grounding at the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of noticing, memory, and metamorphosis that tightens through Vera's three-month tracking and culminates in the shadow's transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow becomes a keeper rather than consumer) with visible cost—the grandmother's stone is given up permanently, and Vera's role shifts from hunter to witness. Orientation anchors (floating library, dusk, Vera's role) arrive early. The comparison-screen beat provides the causal hinge, though the shadow's response to acknowledgment and the stone feels slightly convenient—"I see you" immediately unlocks the metamorphosis without additional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera refuses to let betrayal poison her capacity to care, and the cost is legible—she must carry the knowledge that some creatures were sold, that her three years were partly illusion. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the workshop repair accumulates symbolic and literal density, culminating in the rebuilt enclosure and the vial's placement as reminder. Orientation anchors (Vera, workshop, midnight, post-revelation) arrive within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to report Marcus tomorrow while tonight she "simply worked," crystallizing her refusal to collapse under deception.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, tower, post-surgery dawn) land cleanly by paragraph two. The piece operates under a Causal lens: surgery failure → flight decision → descent with plant guidance, culminating in the hourglass sand falling as Charged Poise—options crystallize (pursue mother's trail vs. submit to doctors) with felt cost (defiance, unknown dangers below). The closure reconfigures the frozen miracle into motion, reweighting Mira's aberration as potential salvation. One meaningful tightening (Thomas's shift from resistance to aid) narrows options and the final image charges prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with psychometric discovery building toward the closure realization that unused love needs planting, not retrieval—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid). The cost remains conceptual (accepting love's incompleteness) rather than felt in the body or through sacrifice. The final image reweights the premise but the price Vera pays is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens: Elara climbs, finds the instrument, understands its function, releases the stardust, and rests. Orientation anchors arrive early (mountain peak, archway, aurora). The closure—releasing the stardust and witnessing its return—constitutes a Decisive Change with visible consequences (valley reawakening). However, the cost feels diluted: Elara's rest and peace seem more reward than price, and the instrument's crumbling reads as convenient rather than a trade-off she must navigate. The seven-night climb is mentioned but not dramatized, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of imagery (bioluminescent flowers, fractured lullaby, chess clocks resonating) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira realizes "dreams weren't the only way to carry hope" while walking with the rescued child. Orientation anchors (Mira, glowing dune, post-forest-burn world) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure carries conceptual cost (flowers dimming, futures held in pockets) and reweights the opening dreamlessness motif, though the cost reads more symbolic than viscerally felt. The wave-function folding and archive mechanics operate more as atmospheric texture than strict causal linkage, which fits the accumulative lens but leaves some ambiguity about whether the rescue fundamentally alters Mira's options or simply affirms her existing path.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors early (waking beneath copper leaves, seventeen years of straying). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hum-music patterns build toward the tree-healing moment, which reweights the talisman and Mira's philosophical stance. Closure lands on the page (gear inserted, tree sings, boundary unraveled) with felt cost (she gives up her academic talisman). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from listener to healer. The ending's "straying was itself a discipline" reprise charges the stakes, though the cost of the gear's loss could be sharpened—it's presented as insight more than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the flame-gathering moment, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible—no prior path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The ridgeway tour functions as a guided meditation rather than a pressure sequence with because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors appear early (widow on ridgeway, three days post-death), but the geography remains allegorical rather than spatially coherent. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending delivers symbolic convergence without a meaningful tightening or cadence shift that reweights Mira's stance with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens: bellhop's dust message → Mira's investigation → discovery of the bolt mechanism → choice to remove it, each step narrowing options. Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change (she begins turning the bolt) with felt cost: risking the storms and village safety for voice. The final image "chosen to stop remaining silent" makes the before/after legible with undeniable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, ancient temple library, pause between constellations) arrive early. Drive lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Mira discovers messages → interprets → retrieves evidence → places it for the scholar. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the evidence is positioned, the false dynasty will fall "not to armies but to ink and vellum," and Mira returns to watch—options have shifted with cost (she has intervened, breaking her vigil pattern). Cost is oblique but legible in the final image. One tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise/Decisive Change: Marina transmits the coordinates, making invisible wounds visible with felt cost (can't resurrect coral, can't restore grandmother's silence). Causality is tight—grandmother's journals → coordinate matching → transmission decision—and the inferred lens (Causal with Accumulative texture) holds. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. The "periodically eternal" resurfaces at closure to reweight the premise (truth surfaces with tides), charging the final image without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds through the repair bay, the opera glasses' history, and the stone circle's hum, culminating in Maya's resolve to return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she crystallizes her purpose and the rebellion's continuity through the stones' revelation, with the cost felt in her three years of barefoot waiting and the scattered comrades who need her teaching. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum shifts her understanding of the lull as breath rather than death. The lens holds and the closure lands on the page with conceptual cost legible in the shift from monument to promise.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing: plant whispers → kite discovery → decoding → unsealing follows because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (Kaluuma, Grandmother Mira, reconstruction context) arrive within the first ~100 words. Closure is a Decisive Change—Mira retrieves the embryo and commits to planting it, altering the valley's future—with felt cost in the form of three years of preparation and the physical ordeal of the hot spring descent. One friction: the kite's discovery by "a child" is coincidental and passive for Mira; she does not pursue it, weakening agency at a key turn. The vine's original tip and the months of searching provide causal grounding, but the convenience of the child-find and the smoothness of the decoding (moss and ferns simply "help") soften escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through layered memory, sensory anchoring, and the photograph ritual until the final seedling image reweights the dominant stake (survival vs. despair). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Earned Stasis—where Mariam's return to the greenhouse with "each one a small vote for the future" forecloses retreat into paralysis, with the cost legible in "not the absence of pain, but the presence of something larger." The cost is felt rather than dramatic, fitting the lens. One friction: the hawk freeze feels like a discrete beat rather than causally tightening options toward the ending, making escalation more textural than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early: Eleanor enters seeking escape, discovers the box, untangles its contents, and achieves conceptual repricing through redesign. Closure lands on-page as she "let the fragments speak their separate truths," delivering a clear before/after with conceptual cost (abandoning unified portraiture). Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse, third landing, Eleanor with portfolio). The walls' constriction and release function as physical markers of pressure, though the mechanism remains atmospheric rather than causally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (albino tracker, wind-carved encampment, three days post-eclipse) land early and clearly. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (ink stains, time distortion, Needle's recording) that reweight Seren's obsession without a traditional causal turn. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks toward the canyon mouth with new understanding and renewed hunt, crystallizing her stance with the cost felt in "quiet, seething rage" and the irreversibility of her brother's death. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink fades and reveals faces, changing her knowledge of the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mira uploads the letter, a Decisive Change with immediate cost (Vance's grip, threats of imprisonment). The causal lens holds—letter discovered → network repair → confrontation → upload—with one meaningful tightening when Vance arrives. Orientation anchors quickly (archivist, Archive, snow, silence). The piece sits comfortably in Track A defaults with a single continuous scene and coherent escalation to an on-page act that forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (roses, dome, sandbag scrap) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's practice absorbs the fleeing soldier, reweighting "hunt" from violence to hope. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The cost is conceptual and relational—she extends mercy to a Sovereignty soldier—but the price feels more thematic than viscerally tested on the page; the soldier weeps and sleeps without resistance or complication that would sharpen the stakes of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the garden responds to cosmic signals, the rail spike transliterates emotions, and the climax accumulates through layered frequencies rather than a causal chain of decisions. Orientation anchors are clear early (sound wave garden, Maren, rail spike, quest for daughter's echo). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the whisper "Don't blame the water. I was trying to reach a star" reweights Maren's grief with conceptual cost (the not-knowing splinter is removed, but she must accept her daughter's agency). The lens holds through the ending without contradiction, and the timeframe "when patterns break themselves" enables passage without solving the problem for her.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative coloring. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. The journalist's call incites investigation; Margaret's proof-by-contradiction method structures her inquiry; discovery of the near-miss asteroid tightens stakes; and her final decision to suppress the truth (with the caveat that the miss was safe) closes with visible cost—she inherits her father's guilt and isolation. The causal chain holds, and closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she becomes him). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length. A micro-penalty for the convenience that the asteroid will miss by exactly enough to make her choice less agonizing—removes some teeth from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of charged images (amber, insect, letters, resonance chamber) accumulates toward a final cadence shift that reweights the guilt-strand. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera releases the tether without changing the past, accepting that "some silences were not emptiness at all." Cost is conceptual and felt—she stops searching for backward repair—but the on-page sentence "Perhaps her mother had still died believing herself unloved" acknowledges uncertainty without visible forfeiture of tactics or relationship. The fold mechanism and amber-translation remain abstract; causality is poetic rather than because/therefore, which fits the lens but leaves the closure unit at the edge of legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words but "the unlearning" remains abstract until the mandala beat. The piece opts for an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and the mandala pattern promise reweighting, and the final image ("mandala breathe," chalk figures on walls) offers a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes invitation. However, the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The closure unit is present but the price remains oblique, limiting upward movement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates weight through layered visions (artisan → fire → soldier → children's descendants) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Kira carves the name, crystallizing her mission against erasure with undeniable cost (exposure, labor, defiance). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the tessera's artisan pride → the soldier's hesitation → the carved name. The cost is legible in "her steel arms aching from the work" and "slipped back into the ruins," signaling danger. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (ghost, orchard, twilight) land within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Madeline weaves temporal echoes that build rising nostalgia and reweight the woman's stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's shift from despair to possibility, visible in her straightened posture and "pale green and silver" rhythm), and the cost is legible—Madeline accepts she will never receive applause but finds purpose in this recursive performance. One tightening (the woman's grip loosening, shoulders straightening) is sufficient at this length. Minor penalty: the woman's transformation happens largely off-stage in reaction rather than through an on-page choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates discovery beats—static shock rewiring, somatic mapping, hidden chamber, journal revelation—through a coherent pattern of Maya learning to read her body's signals, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she commits to follow Daniel's pathways. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: she accepts the risk of pursuing a disappeared person based on trust in an unproven method. Orientation anchors (Maya, studio, post-shock) arrive early and hold. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hidden chamber reweights all prior somatic markers as breadcrumbs rather than random noise.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Vera descends, discovers the fossil, follows warmth to the underground chamber, and encounters the floating lights in a pattern of deepening wonder. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her final stance crystallizes—she will bring proof of the unknown to sleeping humanity—and the elm leaf becomes legend. The cost is conceptual (five years of solitary mapping, the weight of translation) and felt in "stayed...until her journal was full." Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lights respond to the fossil, reweighting the discovery and Vera's role.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: Marlowe catalogs buttons, the pattern emerges, and the jar provides wisdom, building toward a thematic repricing (the forgetting is cleansing, not curse). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—she came to prevent the end, found instructions for a beginning—but the cost is abstract ("weight of responsibility") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The tightening occurs through discovery rather than narrowing options under pressure, which fits the lens but limits felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal: snow coordinates → descent → sanatorium → folder → decision to carry secrets forward. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat (Margaret, Zephyr Bluff, mist, spring tilting). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acknowledgment without absolution) with visible cost: she walks out carrying "the weight of old betrayals and new purposes." One meaningful tightening occurs when Viktor reveals the folder and Margaret must choose; the cost is legible in the final image of her bearing that weight into spring. The two-day ellipsis is motivated and does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the ticking-gutters motif build pressure that releases when they stop, shifting the crossing from treacherous to safe. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the needle exchange crystallizes mutual understanding and reconfigures the coachman's solitary work into a passed legacy with felt cost (he loses his mother's keepsake). Orientation is anchored early (coachman, ferry, fog, Venn crossing). One meaningful deepening occurs when the gutters stop and the exchange happens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Serin chooses to stay, not forever but "long enough to learn its song," foreclosing her wandering path with visible cost (abandoning her search elsewhere). The brass disc revelation deepens understanding and reweights the oasis's survival; the final image of wheel, disc, and palms in parallel rhythms charges prior material. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. Cost is legible: she commits finite time to this place, altering her trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: fire escape garden, midnight, five stories above an alley. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the rosebush's death, the grandfather's inheritance, the harbor rhythm, and the stranger's face, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Marina commits to future planting with visible cost (accepting loss, holding space for endings). One meaningful deepening occurs when the stranger's face appears and the wave is returned, reweighting Marina's isolation into witnessed connection. Causality is clean; no unmotivated leaps. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: she sits among containers, "holding space for everything that grew and everything that ended."

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is prompt: who (Mira), where (tidal library above cloudline), and when (three weeks after the reincarnation memory) anchor by the second paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the reincarnation memory reweights Mira's purpose, the brass sundial's reinterpretation deepens it, and the stone circle's activation delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) where her isolation transforms into welcome with felt cost—she relinquishes her memorial role. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places the sundial and the pattern resolves into winged shapes, narrowing her understanding and opening a new path. Cost is legible: "no longer a relic of extinction, but a bridge."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates through nested images (spiral, spheres, letters) and reaches Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira releases her confession while keeping the nest—a Charged Poise that crystallizes her stance with felt cost (vulnerability of exposure balanced against renewed purpose). Orientation is swift (temple, lily pond, Mira's perch by the second paragraph). The escalation reads as cadence shift and density increase rather than causal tightening, appropriate for this lens, and the closure reweights the opening emptiness with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (basement, Mira, charts, signal). The causal chain is clean: signal discovery → isolation of pattern → faculty division → counter-transmission → signal decay. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (the war continues, she must keep fighting) and the Causal lens holds throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door pounds and the clock runs down, narrowing her window. The cost at closure is conceptual (endless vigilance) rather than visceral loss, which slightly mutes the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is a Decisive Change—Helena unlocks the archives and photographs them—but the cost registers as wistful reflection on her grandmother rather than a felt price paid by Helena herself on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly (observatory ruins, autumn, St. Aldric's Cathedral). The sequence from organ chord to revealed passage to compass-point lock is motivated and legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when the horizontal passage tests her claustrophobia, narrowing her options to crawl or abandon the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Clara, quarry, morning). The structure follows a single-scene investigation leading to Clara's sketch revelation, fitting the accumulative lens. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("not closure, but witness"), but the cost remains abstract—Clara experiences no foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice on the page. The lens holds, but the ending asserts thematic weight without dramatizing a before/after shift in Clara's options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is clean early (weather station, Mira's role, the journals). The causal lens holds: journals → decoding → correlation with data → warning decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mira fulfills her ancestor's mission with visible purpose), but the cost remains abstract—"hope" and "satisfaction" are asserted rather than dramatized through a tangible sacrifice or foreclosed option. The reversal (Commander's shift from skepticism to action) happens off Mira's agency but feels mechanically triggered by data correlation rather than earned through her pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—Margaret's descent toward the cabin reweights "never" into "not yet" with felt opportunity cost (seventy-three years, the bridge abandoned). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs; the hitchhiker's vanishing and the glass-flake gift create a meaningful tightening that narrows Margaret's options to one charged path. Cost is legible in the final image of crossing over, though the magical convenience (cabin waiting, trail appearing) softens the price slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of returns (age 12, 16, 19, post-collapse, final scene) that reweight the caboose from hideout to business hub to reckoning site. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias and his father sit together, the bills coming down, stone markers shift from warning to welcome—cost is the abandoned dream of escape, now accepted. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the father's stone patterns reappear as "request for audience," narrowing Elias's options. Weakness: the startup's three-year arc compresses into summary, flattening what should be visible escalation; the father's presence "still there, having never left" arrives as convenience rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (telegram, stars, temple inscriptions) that converge in translation. Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (decision to publish, share burden) with conceptual cost visible on the page (Marcus's failure reweighted as her new responsibility). However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized—"lighter in sharing" tells rather than shows the trade-off. The "gradual lightening at the horizon" passage weakens propulsion by stating the closure effect before delivering it.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page: Maren completes her interrupted confession, the ice cracks, and her reflection returns—a Decisive Change with visible cost (three years of lifespan traded, the long search endured). Drive lens reads Causal: the seed enables navigation, the touch triggers the whispered confessions, the spoken completion breaks the curse. Orientation is swift (druid, cursed lake's heart, island of stone). One tightening occurs when she steps onto the vine and reaches the frozen face; the final image reweights her earlier guarding with the shadow "stretching faithfully behind her for the first time in years."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: convergence → glade gathering → scar linking → door manifestation builds through density and pattern. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The closure unit is Charged Poise—Mira stands at the threshold, understanding her anchoring role as the bridge, with the seven linked and the door open. Cost is conceptual (she remains root-bound to hold the bridge) but the final image "they would meet it dreaming" asserts rather than dramatizes the price; the reader infers her sacrifice more than sees it reshape options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens: grandmother's trade → Mira's emptiness → descent → negotiation → sacrifice → reclaimed destiny. Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change with visible cost (grandmother's borrowed time ends, Mira gains "damaged, uncertain, frayed" destiny). The trade's price—forty years of certainty for forty years of purpose—is legible and felt in the final image of emerging into darkness as possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) at closure. The piece layers imagery—quarry as inverse amphitheater, cloth holding resonance, stone carved to reveal sky—that converges in Marcus's final realization: "Not found, exactly. Carved free." This is a clean CR moment where the conceptual cost (accepting loss as excavation rather than erasure) reweights the premise. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (Marcus in trailer, three months post-auction). One meaningful deepening occurs when Val names her father's question and Marcus answers it through the cloth, narrowing his stance from paralyzed grief to active seeking. Cost is conceptual but legible: he must walk into the hollow to find what remains.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elena commits to staying with visible cost ("the world continued its turning" below while she remains above). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered images (clay/seed/soil/fruit) and the cadence shifts at "She would stay" crystallize her renunciation of earthly academic life. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the platform arrival. One meaningful deepening (seed → fruit → absorption) reconfigures the opening grief into purpose with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (tidal atrium, titan-gear, post-collapse temporal state). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues pressure through sensory detail, moon-phase rhythm, and the fisherman's recurring delivery, then crystallizes at closure with Mira's decision to remain and her realization that "today held infinite space for wonder." The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she accepts the tomorrow-less cycle with visible cost (no future, only preservation of contradictions). One persistent weakness: the temporal collapse premise is declared but never dramatized as a live constraint that alters a tactic on the page; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Causal linkage is present but soft—fisherman arrives, Mira sorts, reflects, he leaves—without a meaningful tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (bunker inspector, crystal caves, quarterly inspection). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through discovery (shells → confessions → Elena's own writing → Marcus's response) with a cadence shift at the closure. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elena's question and the reweighted crystal image make the before/after legible. Cost is present but muted: the piece implies vulnerability and risk in reaching out, but the on-page price (what Elena forecloses by choosing to try again) remains oblique rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, gathering pressure through memory, place, and the accordion's wounded breath toward a final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren decides she no longer needs the river to forgive her and will "chart her own course"—a renunciation that forecloses dependence on external absolution. The cost is legible in her acceptance of raw feeling and the decision to play the broken accordion where Daniel stood. One minor causality question: the map references in the bathroom graffiti pointing to the black stones feel seeded more than discovered, though the alignment is explained on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is established early (library, mist, shelves), and the piece holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens through discovery beats that deepen stakes. Closure arrives on-page: the protagonist finds her mother's unspoken words, breaks the second letter's seal, discovers her own blank book, and speaks aloud her first truth—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the premise. Cost is felt but oblique: seventeen years of waiting and the act of unveiling/speaking represent emotional forfeiture, though the final image tilts hopeful rather than foreclosing a path with sharp sacrifice. One tightening (watch stops backward motion, points forward) is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (coffee stains, fern whispers, ice violin) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira chooses to be forsworn, propagating the song rather than surrendering the artifact. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: she shatters the violin, accepts being "marked, hunted," and transforms the empire's grasp into cultural dispersal. The before/after is legible: empire claim → song everywhere, ownership → impossibility of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (beautician mortician, grotto, mother's death). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through reflection and ritual toward the infusion moment, which lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the emerald now pulses, the protagonist's stance toward her work shifts). The closure unit reweights her vocation with felt cost—she bears irreplaceable presence home. One pressure deepening (aurora intensifies, urgency before oblivion) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hairpin ritual accumulates meaning across Theron's death scene and Mira's closing reflection. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Closure operates as Conceptual Repricing—Mira reweights her mother's departure and her own role—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. The final image ("Tomorrow, another soul would arrive") gestures toward cyclical acceptance but doesn't dramatize a visible forfeiture or tightening that would elevate the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift and clear (keeper, lighthouse, dawn, Sera arrives). The story operates under a Situational lens: Sera's doubt is crystallized and her stance shifts from desperate search to acceptance, with the keeper's counsel applying pressure. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Sera wraps the shard and descends with altered posture, and the keeper returns to waiting—both stances have visible cost (Sera accepts her sister's absence; the keeper remains professionally isolated). The cost is felt rather than sharply decisive, but the final image reweights prior material and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper reframes the hollow mirror, narrowing Sera's options from endless searching to intentional release.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal linkage. The story teaches its pattern early (the pool-rings demonstration) and pays it off when Vara grasps the interference principle; the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Vara's understanding crystallizes her path and Elowen's vanishing becomes the second stone she must meet. Orientation anchors are clear by paragraph one. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pool demonstration reweights the entire training arc, and cost is legible: Elowen fades toward the unborn, Vara inherits the burden. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: Vessa's invitation crystallizes her role as teacher and the cost of perpetual stillness. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The wanderer's pulse creates a tightening that culminates in the decision to pass knowledge forward, and the arrowhead's implied transfer signals generational cost. The closure reweights Vessa's centuries of waiting with a tangible successor, though the cost remains more felt than dramatized in a visible action or forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by the garden arrival and sustains it through the ending. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation with Charged Poise): Mara chooses not to extract the keystone, crystallizing the sacred-in-the-simple realization. Cost is visible in the decision to descend with "nothing tangible" in a world that has automated wonder. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One minor friction: the mist-walking sequence feels more like a technical obstacle than a pressure-driven escalation that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: descent through the ship, discovery of the journal, uncorking the vial, and the chromatic revelation build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Marcus's final stance—carrying Elena's secret and seeing the color of grief—reweights the opening image of dark piers and hidden research with conceptual cost (he now bears unbearable knowledge). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: "too luminous for unprepared eyes" is made concrete through his new perception of lies and the lanterns' chromatic signature, and the phrase "carrying his wife's secret like a lantern in his chest" charges the final image without solving the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the coins landing on edge and the amber glow crystallize alignment with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting un-happening as becoming), though the felt price remains oblique—dissolution is embraced rather than resisted, so the path foreclosed is implicit. One meaningful deepening occurs through the three coin-casting beats that shift from alignment-reading to certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors early (heartbroken reaper, spiral stairs, observatory at dusk). The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (wax cylinders → atlas page → scattered light → crystallized forms) with a decisive cadence shift when Mira begins finishing the incomplete sentences, reweighting her stance toward carried grief. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she descends with her "small glass menagerie of fears finally named," having transformed unbearable weight into something she can carry—a renunciation of the impossible (bringing Elias back) with visible cost (permanent loss) and a reconfigured relationship to her duty. The cost is legible in "let herself remember Elias without flinching" and the shift from scraping scythe to silent scythe.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual's patient accumulation (measuring fractures, calculating silence, pouring understanding) builds density until the bell's whisper triggers a cosmic response. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new current forms, the universe "drips on," and Corin's brittle devotion holds for "one perfect moment"—the cost is the fragility of the fix and the permanent loss of the Great Salmon. Orientation anchors promptly (Corin, viaduct center, dawn, post-fish apocalypse). The causal chain is loose but acceptable under the textural lens: understanding → drip → whisper → stirring below. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell warms and begins to ring.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (Martha, ridgeway, October evening, reservoir town). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: photographs accumulate to reweight Martha's narrative about her father, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) when she decides to tell the true story. The closure lands on the page with felt cost ("let the past be complicated"), and the lens holds. However, the photographs function more as revelatory props than as a causal chain that narrows options—she discovers rather than chooses her way through the sequence—which slightly blunts escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the orchard visit ritual, the crystal's thaw, and starling patterns build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the crystal releases its "touch of wonder" into Elara, completing her preparation). The closure unit is a Charged Poise/transformation moment where she steps through the waterfall "ready" and "whole," with the cost legible in the empty chain and the irreversible change. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "Logic builds the vessel. Intuition fills it with light" and acts on it by flaming the crystal. The lens holds and the RR lands with felt cost (the mother's gift consumed, childhood ended), meeting the 600–800 word closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with causal pressure tightening through Vera's repeated revision and the partial-evacuation choice. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (name, arbor, seventeen years, role). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera's choice to document anomalous patterns and carry doubt honestly forecloses the path of false certainty, charged by the parachute buckle moment at dawn. Cost is felt (mother's death as cautionary stake, reputational risk with Ash) and the final image—recording for future watchers—reweights the watcher's burden with undeniable pressure. One minor wobble: the dawn resolution arrives slightly fast after six hours compressed into a single sentence, creating a micro-elision that doesn't harm closure but leaves the escalation's final turn feeling summarized rather than dramatized at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Situational (pressure forces stance crystallization). Orientation anchors arrive late—Kira's backstory and the dojo's purpose surface after ~150 words, creating mild fog. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the handshake and training pact), but the cost is entirely prospective ("might take years or might take forever") rather than paid on the page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no resource spent. The inferred lens holds, but the ending reweights potential rather than present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Victor completes the acoustic ritual and decides to call Margaret, forecloses silence with visible cost (tears, broken singing), and the ending image of "something that had been clenched began to loosen" reweights prior material. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first two paragraphs. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered sensory and acoustic imagery toward a cadence shift at closure. One causal gap: the groundskeeper's journal and maceration process appear abruptly without prior signal, creating minor setup debt, but the ritual's mechanics land clearly enough to preserve closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's decision to welcome company reweights her seventeen-year stance with felt cost—she abandons protective isolation for connection's uncertainty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the mist, frozen garden, and recurring stillness imagery deepen until the final cadence shift ("not wait alone") reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's arrival forces Maren's long-frozen interior to thaw, altering her from guardian to companion with the garden's permission.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (hybrid). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first two paragraphs. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (crozier transforms into severance instrument) with Charged Poise (Maren ascending with knowledge of tomorrow's act), and the cost is legible: she will likely be killed, and the empire's fuel supply will be disrupted. One meaningful tightening occurs when the approximation formula succeeds after seventeen failures, narrowing options to the Hall of Succession confrontation. The final image charges prior material (grandfather's failed lever becomes her successful blade), though the empire-wide consequence ("other families would learn") ventures into summary rather than remaining tight to Maren's immediate sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is anchored by ~40 words (Mira, Spire Nine, gorge, Voxhaven). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the perigee approach, filter removal, and the "shard of hush" descent, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence reweights her stance—"endings were not walls but doors"—with conceptual cost felt in her weeping and the decision to return with recordings. The tightening is meaningful: reversing amplification and discarding filters narrows her technical options and charges the final image of towers "ready to receive." One persistent constraint (the moon's proximity as a live clock) shapes the entire attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara stays aboard holding the now-filling hourglass, crystallizing her role as rescuer of other lost souls with felt cost (she alone remembers, passengers disembark into a world that has moved on). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered voices on the radio, phosphorescence patterns, and the final image of starlight gathering in the hourglass. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (ferry, deckhand, seventeen minutes). One meaningful deepening when the hourglass is upended and the grotto shudders, reweighting all prior material. Cost is legible: Mara endures splitting pain and permanent liminality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Marina claims the gallery by weaving a stable geometry within chaos, and "the walls stopped shifting" demonstrates visible cost (containment within the smaller sinew structure). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—fever symptoms layered into architecture, thread marking pattern, mirrors multiplying—with a decisive cadence shift at "the gallery settle[d]." Orientation is clean (fever dream architect, optical illusion gallery, present action). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes connection has "tension...strain of material pulled between fixed points," altering her tactics from wandering to deliberate gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with thematic deepening. Orientation anchors (Commander Vara, benthic city, three months post-contact) land by the second paragraph. The arc tightens from doubt to glimpsed understanding; the chain link frames and is paid off at closure when Vara relinquishes it, foreclosing her old navigation paradigm with felt cost. One slight seam: the leap from seeing starlight patterns to "horizons unfold" compresses causal steps, but the RR (Charged Poise transitioning to nascent change) lands with undeniable pressure in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The closure unit—Margaret's forgiveness releasing Ruth's pulse—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is told rather than shown: we're assured Margaret "can sleep" without witnessing what she has sacrificed or foreclosed. The Drive Lens is Situational (grief reaching breaking point summons the dead), yet the final beat resolves via off-stage emotional transaction. No Orientation Test penalty applied; the piece teaches its metaphysical premise early and holds spatial logic, but the closure effect remains asserted rather than dramatized with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (elevator shaft, headlamp, flooded facility). The piece moves through a clear descent–discovery–ascent arc with minimal escalation; each body and the codex are logged without a reversal that narrows options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira writes the names, fulfilling her stated mission, but the cost is conceptual (endurance) rather than a visible trade-off on the page. The two-hour tidal window is declared but never tightens tactics. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repetition (bodies, names, gold flecks) and the final list-making reweights the opening, yet the pattern does not break or intensify—it confirms.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (opal light, ink patterns, snow, heartbeats) toward a final reconfiguration where Mira stops counting and walks out "carrying her failures like lanterns." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she has endured the ritual and integrated her ghost with felt cost (the weight of reclaimed grief). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (observatory, 3:47 AM, Mira alone). The ink-reading method arrives late but the piece teaches its pattern early enough to support the ending's coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a final Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page: the language is resurrected, the diamond shatters, and she walks deeper with recovered knowledge—a decisive shift from dying to reviving the tongue. Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, bone towers, her purpose). The accumulation—copper veins hum, birds form phonemes, echoes multiply—tightens toward the climactic speaking, and cost is legible (diamond destroyed, "true work lay ahead"). One structural seam: the birds' algorithmic nature and the copper-channeling mechanism arrive late and feel under-earned, relying on sudden insight rather than prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are clear by the opening paragraphs (underground garden, Maren's three-month cover, Samuel's death two years post-disappearance). The causal lens holds: arrowhead discovery triggers phone playback, which reveals Samuel's metamorphosis, prompting Maren's choice to document without bitterness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she renounces vindictive proof in favor of patient devotion, forecloses the bitterness path with visible cost (years more of dismissed research, continued scoffing). One meaningful tightening occurs when the floating objects and phone confession crystallize the cryptid's true nature, narrowing her options to exploitation or honor.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (sky-bridge, orchard, statues) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mira's music cracks the statues and she begins her descent to "reawaken every sleeping dreamer." The causal lens holds through most beats (playing → statue climbs → she signals → others join → statues crack), but the middle pivot—heartbeat signaling that triggers mass synchronization—happens off-page and feels convenient rather than motivated by prior cause-effect linkage. The cost (the old laws ending, her vulnerability on the bridge) is somewhat abstract; we see the statues crack but not what Mira personally loses or risks in that final image. One meaningful tightening is present when the statue begins climbing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (cobalt light, bottled storm, silent machines) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Marcus threading through surveillance gaps becomes an earned metaphor for love persisting. Cost is legible: he remains in the arcade, waiting for the next delivery, his father still absent. Orientation anchors cleanly (Marcus, arcade, 7:47 PM). One meaningful deepening occurs when the daughter receives both storm and letters, reweighting her belief she'd been forgotten. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation quickly (abandoned train, Marcus's silence, his search) and follows an accumulative lens: discovery → phonograph → singing → resolution to stay. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (silence transformed from prison to canvas) with visible cost (accepting broken singing, committing to isolation). One meaningful tightening occurs when the halo fragment and recording converge to unlock voice. The causality is clean, though the phonograph's appearance and its exact song feel serendipitous in a way that leans on situational logic more than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of surreal geometry and analog-memory motifs by the midpoint, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) when Eleanor stands in the impossible room and understands the scarf as map. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (librarian, three-a.m. opening, scientific poetry collection). The cost is felt—her solitude shifts from observed to "understood," foreclosing the option of ordinary connection—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening (geometry shifting → room discovery → scarf revelation) suffices at this length, though the conceptual stakes remain more asserted than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through repeated failed attempts, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of luminous absence as presence) with visible cost—she continues the ritual, her mother remains "distant, remained gone." Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The fog-breakthrough beat provides a meaningful tightening that reweights prior material. One structural concern: the epilogue section (visitors arriving, teaching others) feels like a second, softer ending that slightly diffuses the photograph-reveal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (locksmith, nexus, starlight, seventeen-year quest) land by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: symbols shift, whispers disorient, the mechanism is found and transformed in a lyric sequence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ribbon changes, Elena speaks); cost is conceptual—Mira rewrites cosmic truth—but the exact price she pays remains oblique. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes she must transform the idea, not merely free it, narrowing her approach and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elara opens the jar, recovers memories, and commits to a new method ("gather memories like mushrooms, marking where they grew"). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens (layered imagery: greenhouse, shipwrecks, fairy ring, constellation gaps) that coheres at the ending when the fairy ring vanishes and "new patterns were forming." Orientation anchors (sunken greenhouse, thirty-year gap, November wind) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she aligns void with fairy ring's edge and finds the jar, narrowing her search into recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph and establishes reversible exile stakes early. Closure arrives through Mira's annotation act—a Decisive Change that forecloses one path (leaving Kael exiled) with visible cost (her own vulnerability to judgment, the weight of responsibility)—under a primarily Causal lens with Accumulative texture. However, the cost feels more asserted than demonstrated in the final image; the wax seal and tomorrow's promise carry conceptual weight but lack the sharp sting of immediate forfeit. The tea-leaf divination beat provides a meaningful tightening that narrows Mira's options, and the exile-reversal decision flows from established causality, but the ending drifts slightly toward summary ("ready to teach him") rather than a charged present-tense image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Old Marek, parapet garden, war's final spring). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the forty-year tending, the fading colors, and the seed's emergence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Marek commits to ongoing preservation with the cost of his remaining years legible in "truly old." The causal chain from fading wonder → planting → breathing essence → new tree → renewal is clean, though the mechanics of "capturing essence" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mira's hands stop shaking through the act of unraveling, enabling her to return to restoration with visible transformation (gold-stitched cracks instead of seamless repair). The causal lens holds—each knot loosened releases a confession, each confession eases Callum's form, and the cumulative work steadies Mira's purpose. Orientation is swift (prism sanctuary, Mira kneeling, mask fragments) and the tightening occurs when she begins threading the needle and Callum materializes, raising the cost of the exchange. One micro turn (Callum's question "Why do you do this?") deepens without fracturing the through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative lens is inferred and held: Elena gathers evidence through video comparison, and pressure tightens as differences accumulate (pigment loss, new expressions on stones, the torn map). Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she commits to writing the report with visible cost ("typed until dawn") and the chapel "at last, began to whisper," reconfiguring the silence into potential speech. The orientation anchors (Elena, vault, laptop footage) land cleanly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the henge stones' impossible new expressions force her interpretive stance to crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean within the first third; the piece establishes who/where/when efficiently. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise) at closure: Eleanor's decision to surface with the artifacts and internalize the captain's lesson reweights her relationship to grief with visible cost—she must carry forward both the public findings and private transformation. Causality is motivated by her search and discovery; the snow globe and captain's pages function as the pivot that deepens her understanding. One meaningful tightening occurs when she reads the captain's words and grasps the physics of surrender, narrowing her stance from holding on to releasing.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (balladeer, floating monastery, ghost communication pattern). The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: Mira's realization that the ghost's gift is "a new way to speak" reweights her role from interpreter to perpetuator, and her decision to paint in secret places forecloses direct performance with felt isolation cost. The three-month gathering arc and the courtyard scene cohere causally. The escalation from understanding to singing to dispersal reads as density increase and cadence shift, meeting the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Mira decodes the diary, ascends the elevator reading entries that reweight her understanding, and reaches the observatory to enact her mother's instruction. Orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored early), and the closure—releasing the preserved memories—occurs on the page with Lady Vesper's tears as visible cost. However, the decisive change relies on Mira's execution of her mother's posthumous plan rather than a choice that narrows live options; the ending feels more like fulfillment of instruction than a reconfiguration born of present pressure. The cost is felt but somewhat diffuse, more Lady Vesper's release than Mira's sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Elena in a sky gondola with her father's telescope, three weeks after losing her job when the tether snapped. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered cloud observations and reflections that reweigh her understanding of her work and loss. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena commits to continuing her emotional meteorology catalog, foreclosing return to conventional work. The cost is visible but quiet—she accepts permanent drift and isolation as the price of this new language.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered images (coin, tree, manuscript, portrait) and the closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara walks away carrying secrets, having understood that "discovering limits means learning they are not prisons but doorways." Cost is conceptual (the tree's destruction, the failed mirror-heaven project) and felt through the final stillness. Orientation anchors (Elara, Great Oak library, night before demolition) land cleanly within the first several paragraphs. One tightening occurs when she decodes the coin and finds the hidden manuscript; the ending reweights her blindness and the scholars' failure into a purposeful threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (airship, three weeks alone, map apprentice). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery deepens from hopscotch → cipher → coordinates → luminance appearance, culminating in thirty pages of observations that reweight her abandonment into opportunity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the captain finds her transformed, charts in hand) with conceptual cost legible (isolation became her advantage). One tightening: the luminance's appearance answers the coordinate puzzle. Causality is clean throughout; the because/therefore chain from curiosity → pattern-noting → discovery is motivated and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors orientation early (frozen library, Mira's title, her quest) and follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (mirrors, prophecy, gears) toward a final reconfiguration when she uncaps the vial and assembles the mechanism. Closure lands on-page with the note resonating through mirrors and Mira's transformation from frozen indecision to active repair. Cost is felt (she releases something that "could not be contained again") and the clock tower ticking signals consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses to uncap the vial, reweighting her understanding of repair as transformation rather than restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: recurring chalk messages and the butterfly bell pattern accumulate rather than drive causal turns. However, closure reads as a static restatement—Elara's evening message and the ghost's reply do not reweight prior material with visible cost; the ghost continues "his quiet work" without foreclosure or transformation. The "brambled hope" image in the penultimate paragraph gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but remains abstract assertion rather than a charged final image that makes cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mira is and her exact situation emerge gradually through reflection rather than early anchoring (−0.3). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through nested time imagery and the lullaby's refraction, and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the clock freezes, the lullaby reaches all children. However, the cost remains asserted ("nothing left to give") rather than shown on the page in the final beat; no visible forfeiture or alteration of Mira's state occurs in the ending lines. The causal link between adjusting the clock and the lullaby's propagation is explained retrospectively ("she had spent a lifetime calculating") rather than dramatized through a because/therefore chain of on-page moves.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal/Situational Hybrid—Maren's choice to mark the path reactivates the birds (causal), pressure coheres around the frost deadline (situational). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she turns toward home accepting the orchard's purpose, a stance crystallization with felt cost (perpetual duty, bitter nuts). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the birds respond to the nut marks, narrowing options and enabling rescue. Cost is visible in her resignation to caretaking and the orchard's curse.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (polymer chemist at ravine, two years post-loss) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira moves from fighting loss to honoring connection, designing a dissolving membrane that embodies this shift. The cost is legible—she abandons fifteen years of pursuing permanent bonds. However, the three-month ellipsis to "first successful test" compresses the core struggle into summary, and the closure unit relies heavily on told realization rather than a final dramatized beat that tests the new stance. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the chrysalis and foam patterns braiding through, but the ending drifts toward explanation rather than charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of particulate images (glass, moonlight, slates) that accumulate pressure toward a final reconfiguration when the child begins writing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vera recognizes that "the place where narratives are born isn't a location at all" and the final image reweights her quest through the child's action. Cost is conceptual—her search ends not in discovery of a place but acceptance of process—though the price feels more philosophical than felt. Orientation anchors (glass library, parole bracelet, opening day) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child touches the slate and words appear, crystallizing the thematic premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page: Elara's selective deposit creates a Decisive Change with visible cost (she keeps painful memories that teach). Causal lens holds: rain creates map → she follows tidal pools → discovers pavilion → tastes others' emptiness → chooses surgical transfer → emerges changed, touches Cassius willingly. The "close of an unspoken dream" timeframe functions more as atmosphere than constraint, creating mild lens wobble, but the core because/therefore chain remains intact and the cost is legible in the final cooking scene.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraphs and maintains spatial coherence. However, closure operates as thematic assertion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost: the elevators hum, Elena continues broadcasting, and the final paragraph offers only a prediction of future worker reactions. The rehabilitation "works" without visible resistance, failure, or price that reweights prior stakes. Under an Accumulative lens, the ending lacks the cadence shift or pattern break that would charge the final image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery and reflection. However, the closure unit—Vera's realization that "all dreams were ultimately one dream"—arrives as philosophical summary rather than a concrete image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. The narrative arc is more meditative spiral than escalation; the "quaking reverie" delivers memories but no meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options. The ending gestures toward transformation but lacks the on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, immediate goal). The piece follows a single-POV, two-location structure (descent/chamber) with one clean transition, fitting Track A defaults. Closure arrives on-page as Charged Poise: Elara emerges carrying combinations and commits to guardianship, crystallizing her stance with the felt cost of burden ("some doors should remain closed"). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—mist reveals, gravity inverts, symbols burn into memory—building density toward the final image of her doodle waiting in the hollow. One meaningful deepening (the inversion revelation) reweights the stakes. Minor gap: the cost of guardianship is declared more than dramatized in a specific forfeiture on the page, keeping this shy of 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the stress-crack discovery deepens the sonic problem, and the final playing beat reweights the premise (music travels inward, not outward). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—she finds a new channel and the cost is implicit (acceptance of the silence, commitment to a harder path). Orientation is clean. The midpoint turn (stress cracks teach her to reverse her approach) narrows options and the ending image charges prior material, though the cost could be more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: Helena's night at the nexus accumulates sensory and reflective density toward a closure image of renewal and shared mission. Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, magnetic nexus, twilight) arrive early. The closure is Charged Poise—she leaves with journal and resolve to find another exile—but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the "game continues" line summarizes rather than reconfigures. One meaningful deepening (her realization that the covenant can renew in "two hearts") occurs, but it arrives via reflection rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25%: Vera catalogs silence, strikes tuning forks, and the clasp opens as frequencies align. Orientation is clean (workshop, tonight, fireworks imminent). The closure—clasp opening and Vera's realization—lands on the page with a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of not-knowing), though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful deepening occurs when she speaks forgiveness aloud and the mechanism yields, reweighting her seventeen-year grief into grace. However, the final paragraphs summarize thematic insight rather than dramatizing a decisive image, slightly weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under a hybrid lens: causal journey with accumulative texture. Orientation is swift (rope ladder, dawn, village name). The closure—Mira's realization that serenity is in motion, not place—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) with visible cost: she leaves the sanctuary. The seed becomes her portable lesson. One tightening: the flower's decay and her acceptance of its lesson narrow her understanding. Cost is legible in her departure and the burden of future cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors quickly (pilot, planet, countdown) and delivers a clear RR: Maren grasps that resilience is practice, not substance, and leaves her seed with visible cost (she cannot take the source home). The causal chain from water flow → hidden valley → artifact contact → voice-trigger → epiphany holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when gravity inverts. The cost is legible in her decision to plant rather than harvest, though the epiphany mechanism (touch = voice chorus) arrives conveniently late without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows a causal lens: Mira's father's death → her obsessive documentation → discovery of the wind pattern → determination to prevent the next accident. One meaningful tightening occurs when her readings "confirmed what she suspected" at Vasquez's death site, narrowing her mission. The closure operates as Earned Stasis with visible cost: she walks alone, unheard, carrying forward her solitary investigation despite rejection. The cost is legible in "By morning, she would have another page of warnings documented. By next week, perhaps, someone would listen"—the price of her commitment is isolation and deferred impact.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Meren's search → arrival → reading the aurora → bell rings → world changes. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (ice cavern, Meren climbing). However, the closure—"wonder had never needed certification. It had only needed someone willing to ring the bell"—is stated rather than shown through a decisive image or action that reweights prior material with visible cost. The amber sheet crumbling is a symbolic gesture, but the protagonist's options or knowledge do not narrow or shift in a legible before/after moment. The ending tells us the effect ("unfetter every sealed conservatory") rather than dramatizing a cost Meren pays or a path she forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors promptly (Mira, Thunder-echo Range, post-guardianship era, climbing toward Keeper's Hollow). The causal chain is clean: Mira witnessed the veil tear → seeks understanding → uses the flute to step sideways into the past → discovers the flaw (harmony vs. counterpoint) → returns with actionable knowledge. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she has broken her oath and now possesses the wisdom to sing discord when the veil weakens again; the cost is solitude, disobedience, and the weight of being the sole bearer of this dangerous knowledge. The lens is Causal with lyric texture; the final image reweights "silence" from emptiness to potential, charging the ending without requiring a decisive physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors appear by the third paragraph (Mira, topaz workshop, vanishing stars). The piece accumulates density through recurring images (stars, halo fragment, type-setting) and arrives at a Conceptual Repricing: emotion as harmony rather than formula. However, the cost remains abstract—Mira smiles and continues working with no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift. The before/after legibility depends on thematic assertion ("finally understanding") rather than a dramatized constraint or loss that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when unclear until "courier for eleven years" and "northern peaks" emerge past the 120-word mark; applying −0.4 for delayed spatial grounding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's steadier steps and internal warmth reweight her purpose from transaction to transformation. However, the cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible—no specific forfeiture or trade-off dramatized on the page. The pendant's "germination" unfolds across seven prior monasteries (off-page), diluting on-page pressure. One tightening occurs (trembling eases, devotion crystallizes), meeting the accumulative standard, but the final image asserts transformation without pointing to a sentence where a live option was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers memory, object, and frost patterns to reweight Elara's stake from proving a theory to honoring lived truth. Orientation anchors clearly (quartz arbor, dawn, Elara with prism). The closure—"Some lies, after all, are simply truths that haven't found their evidence yet"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with felt cost (abandoning publication, accepting singularity). One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from proving to communing. Cost is legible but somewhat abstract; the renunciation of scientific validation could be more viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the piece follows Track A (single POV, one scene). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered backstory and the final image reweights the generational weaving motif with cost (Mei's dissolution). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (becoming the message completes the family trade). The cost is conceptual and visible on the page ("felt herself begin to unravel"), though the physicality remains somewhat abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs when the amber bead glows and Mei sees across time, narrowing her options to self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through descent, encounter, knowledge transfer, and return, with the closure resting on the resonant image of blue flames and the recurring orchards. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Oren's years-long labor forecloses flight and the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (isolation, decades of toil). However, the pivotal bargain and knowledge transfer are summarized in two paragraphs rather than dramatized, and the multi-year epilogue compresses the core escalation into told outcome, weakening on-page cost proof at the ending beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with a clean vision-beat that retrospectively reframes the mother's disappearance and the shard's function. Closure lands as Decisive Change: Mira shifts from seeking her mother to continuing her mother's fatal mission, with the cost made explicit (dimensional toxicity, inevitable death). Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line three). One meaningful tightening occurs when the surge crests and the vision delivers the withheld truth, narrowing Mira's options to a sacrificial path.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's decision to protect the chain and add her voice reweights her eleven-year silence with visible cost (breaking her defining trait). The accumulative lens holds—stones, letter, sea glass accumulate meaning and pressure—culminating in her spoken vow and the cairn rebuild. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One deduction: the ghost's "presence" remains abstract until late, slightly delaying full stakes legibility, and the "brief luminescence" at the end flirts with convenience though it reads as thematic echo rather than plot solution.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates imagery and thematic weight across the lighthouse ascent, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending returns to the established routine with gentle rain—resonance is gestured at ("new dawn shaped by ancient shadows") but the closure lacks a decisive reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The prophetic declarations and storm "conversation" remain abstract; no dramatized consequence or forecloses path makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the morpho wing, light trails, and Mei-Lin's notebooks layer meaning toward the final decision to stay. Orientation anchors (tea house, three months post-surgery, Meridian Valley) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure is Charged Poise—Senna commits to tracking the sun trails—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the trade-off felt in the final beat. The dye master's exposition does causal work (reveals wing, explains Mei-Lin's gift), yet the confession and the decision to stay feel more like theme fulfillment than pressure-driven necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: broken sextant → moonlight repair → deconstruction → remapping → understanding trees as witnesses. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's work reweights from hedge-trimming to grief-maintenance, and the fourteen-unit release demonstrates visible cost while forty-one remain held. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. One micro-slip: the "moment a pin is heard" arrives as poetic timestamp rather than pressure catalyst, but the assembly completion does narrow her role with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woven dawns spreading, other voices joining, cost made explicit in "remember nothing of herself." The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear pattern teaching (songs, mica, light threads) and a decisive intensification when the web of light pushes outward. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words. One minor causality slip: the "darkness pressed harder" moment needs clearer mechanical stakes to justify why it doesn't succeed in breaking through.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs (who: Miriam; where: secret library; when: approaching midnight). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Miriam accepts the paradox of "staying while leaving"—but the cost feels abstract rather than dramatized. The librarian's exposition drives the turn rather than Miriam's on-page choices narrowing options. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of paradoxes reweights her hiding), but the reweighting happens via explanation rather than image or action with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (tea house, Mei, morning, frost). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered memories, the bread's emergence, and the guerrilla gardening method, culminating in the wheat-planting act that reweights the dominant stake of resisting erasure. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mei's refusal to participate in forgetting is crystallized on-page with the whispered bakery name, and the cost—her solitary burden, the uncertainty of discovery—is felt. One meaningful deepening (bread → wheat seeds → physical planting) tightens the pattern, and the final image charges prior material without requiring a causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening paragraph). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through measurement, discovery, and dissolution until the final choice reweights the premise—preservation becomes choosing what to carry forward. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost: the library crumbles, but the single captured vow redefines meaning-making as selective rather than comprehensive. One meaningful deepening (the child's promise discovery) narrows options and charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with clear who/where/when anchors by the opening paragraph. The closure—Eliza securing the cylinder and preserving the truce—lands on the page with a decision that forecloses the deal, though the cost registers more as relief than sacrifice. The watch fob recurs but its symbolic weight doesn't narrow her options in the final beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when she intercepts the handoff, but the escalation from prior failed attempts to success feels more like persistence than a causal reversal that changes her knowledge or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors Vera on the lavender bluff early, and the three weather-carriers converging creates forward motion. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Vera recognizes her own invisible weather and accepts her role), but the cost remains abstract—no visible path is foreclosed, no concrete price paid on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (aurora, taste, ring, forest votes layer toward a final synthesis), yet the brother's lightning-aspen merger and Vera's acceptance both arrive through exposition rather than dramatized turns. The "final votes" and "tomorrow, bright as copper" gesture toward reconfiguration, but the felt cost required for high-band closure is not legible in a specific sentence or image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, crystal cave, evening after closing). The closure—drawing both portraits and hanging them—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis broken into agency) with visible cost (tears, the foreclosure of her father's prohibition). The causal chain from funeral → letter → hidden painting → drawing is coherent. One persistent constraint (the suppressed artistic calling) shapes tactics throughout and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes a clear causal chain: letter fragment → map assembly → tunnel journey → Archive discovery → recording playback → inscription, and the closure lands on the page with a completed action (the gilding). Orientation anchors emerge within the first 120 words. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt—Mei Lin loses no live option and gains only understanding, making the before/after shift more thematic than stake-altering. The drive lens reads as Causal with an Accumulative accent (the "lost conversations" motif), but the ending leans toward Conceptual Repricing without a sharp enough reweighting of prior material to fully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bell's seven-year silence, the iceberg fragment's ancient air, and the kinetic sculpture build density toward a cadence shift when the bell rings truthfully. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the bell's truth clears literal fog, Maren departs with "muted vigor"), and the cost is conceptual—wonder preserved through her sacrifice of voice and solitary descent. One friction: the iceberg's eventual melting is named but the bronze "remembering" feels asserted rather than dramatized, softening the closure's undeniability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: VERA-7 destroys the box, miniaturizes the remains, buries the grain, and achieves "fragmented wholeness...something like peace" with visible cost (forty-seven years of static resolved through fire and earth). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated rose/dome/static motifs, the magnetic shift pressures the timing, and the final cadence shift ("A machine who had learned to burn") reweights the premise. Orientation anchors early (desert rose farm, glass dome, caretaker). One meaningful deepening (the box opening → burning → burying) narrows her interior options and the ending image ("turned with them") charges prior material. Cost is legible: she loses the borrowed grief that defined her and gains solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (courtyard, dawn, three days since locket found). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the locket opens, the granddaughter's seventeen-year pilgrimage is made legible, and Mrs. Okonkwo's grief shifts from calcified to speakable. Cost is felt—seventeen years of silence crystallize into a pending reunion—but the decisive meeting remains off-page, weakening the closure's immediacy. The phrase "Then let's hear them" promises future action rather than completing present transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes meaning through layered images (dice, dance, encrypted records) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Marina understands fear as encrypted strength. Orientation anchors (Marina, sunken lab, seventeen-day quest) land early. The closure reweights the premise—vulnerability becomes armor—with conceptual cost (the weight of inherited terror), though the cost remains more asserted than dramatized in a pivotal beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when dance decrypts the secrets, but no on-page reversal tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. The story delivers a Decisive Change—Mira steps through the door with lantern raised, closing her eleven-year role as dock-lighter and opening a new boundary-keeper path—with visible cost (leaving her known world, stepping into transparency). Causality holds: whale beaches → sphere extracted → Mira investigates → coffee grounds guide her → she uses her mother's book → sphere cracks → she lights the hidden lantern → door opens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sphere cracks and her mother's voice directs her. Cost is present but muted: the final image emphasizes triumph and reunion more than sacrifice, and the "gleaming silence" she leaves behind reads more poetic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when efficiently in the opening paragraphs, and the dominant stake (hush the prophecy to prevent violence) is signaled early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mira's expanding awareness and the ritual's lyric progression aim to deepen rather than reverse causally. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Mira retrieves the wing, smiles, and returns home without forfeiting a live option or paying a price legible in action or image. The final paragraph asserts that "the world had been given the gift of uncertainty" but does not dramatize what Mira lost or relinquished to achieve it, leaving the Resonant Reconfiguration incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertones. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the narrator inhabits the teacher role with the same opening line, reweighting the sugar motif and cycle. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (rooftop, narrator below Professor Voss). Cost is legible: the narrator trades active life for custodial waiting, tending a garden and stockpiling sugar for uncertain arrivals. One meaningful deepening occurs as the narrator learns to read buildings, culminating in accepting the teaching mantle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening beat. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mirabel's night-long recitation accumulates pressure through density and duration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) when Elena's voice emerges and the sisters begin walking toward each other. The closure reweights the premise—isolation translated into independence, gift versus theft—with felt cost (Mirabel empties herself, walks away not knowing if it worked). One meaningful deepening occurs when her monologue stretches through the night, narrowing her tactical options and raising the emotional ante. The ellipsis between her departure and Elena's awakening is motivated and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens: Veren's decision to forge the treaty is motivated by decades of guilt, the rose thorn and blood anchor the act in ritual specificity, and the key's crumbling signals an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he completes what could not be finished, foreclosing his path of guilt with visible cost). Orientation is clear early (marble sanctuary, aurora, calligraphy forger at work), and the single-scene structure tightens toward the signature's completion. The cost is legible: the key dissolves, his silence ends, and he accepts the "beautiful crime that honor demanded," though the final walk toward peace lacks a sharper image of what he has truly forfeited beyond internal release.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's choice of silence forecloses her ability to sing freely, a visible cost tied to her mother's fate and the canyon's hunger. The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture—progressive revelations tighten her understanding until the seashell delivers the key knowledge that narrows her options. One quibble: the elders' conspiracy is told through vision rather than tested on-page, softening the escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes Mira's setting, vocation, and the ghost-haunting problem cleanly within the first third. Causality flows: villagers bring journals → Mira reads dreams → she discovers the lighthouse sabotage → she resolves to expose it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elise steps through the opened window, her recognition secured, and Mira carries the snow globe into dawn with the truth pending before the council. Cost is conceptual and felt—Mira will name a dead man's crime and implicate his living son—but the final image charges that poise without showing the confrontation or its social fallout on the page. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative undertones (dream-pattern analysis, ice-memory motif), and the ending holds under that hybrid without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with layered patterns (firefly rhythms, net-mending, grandmother's legacy) and maintains spatial coherence on the parapet. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration through the charged final image of descent with the whisk, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the firefly-whistle communion provides a meaningful deepening, yet the ending's reconfiguration feels more meditative than decisive, and the cost of her silence never becomes urgent or painful enough to fully charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Maya's investigation of the orchard leads to the letters, which reveal the diamond's location and function, culminating in her decision to expose the Consortium's lie. Orientation is clear early (post-apocalyptic orchard, Maya alone), and the closure—her taking the diamond and samples with intent to broadcast truth—lands on the page with conceptual cost (she's now a target carrying explosive knowledge). However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; we're told she's motivated but don't see her weighing the danger of becoming the Consortium's enemy. The midpoint tightening (discovering the stillpoint, finding the diamond) narrows options cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Miriam's broadcast of doubt and invitation transforms the campfires from war preparation to pilgrimage, reweighting her loneliness from isolation to "waiting for them to arrive ready to listen." The causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds—radio intercept triggers tactical choice (cancel assault), which crystallizes her prophetic stance with visible cost (accepting followers she never wanted). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. One micro-turn (the campfires' direction shift) sets up closure without undermining the dominant choice. Cost is legible: she must now teach, ending her solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of footprints and "stories that nothing could wash away," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—Marcus experiences no visible loss or foreclosed path. The music box mystery is resolved entirely in summary ("The three notes spelled a name...") rather than dramatized pressure. Orientation is clear early; the structure is single-scene reflective with minimal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Consortium threat → Vera's decision to release the Tone → vibrational matching → dissolution. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs. The closure unit is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (Vera disperses into sound, the bell cracks, absolution spreads), and the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture in the final beats. One weakness: the "vibrational matching" mechanism and Vera's unique qualification for it arrive late without prior setup, creating a mild convenience feel. The inferred lens (Hybrid: Causal escalation → Accumulative closure) holds, and the cost is legible on the page, though the final image could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, Mira's role by paragraph two). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: measurements accrue, the viaduct discovery deepens understanding, and the final image reweights patience as erosion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"everything could change" in the earned moment of inattention—but the cost remains conceptual and future-tense rather than felt on the page, keeping it shy of high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (transit investigator, maintenance tunnel, David's file). The discovery sequence—tunnel entrance, lantern, storage containers—builds causally toward Margaret's decision to distribute evidence, creating a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (career risk, personal danger). The flashback to David's death and the three-year compliance history are told rather than shown, weakening the escalation's immediacy. The closure lands with felt stakes but the promised consequences ("whatever consequences awaited") remain off-page, slightly reducing cost legibility at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through mirrored images (frozen gears/forced repair, storm clouds parting, music box melody) that converge at closure. Orientation anchors promptly (shop, Father Marcus, clockwork heart). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Father Marcus composes words in his mind as light breaks and a repaired music box plays, crystallizing his path forward with felt cost (the ghost of silence within restored melody). One meaningful deepening occurs when Ruth diagnoses the forced repair, which parallels Marcus's testimony and reweights his task.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly (workshop, acid sea, cart glider) and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through kaleidoscope visions, the yearning algorithm, and arrow-tip integration toward a final launch that crystallizes Zephyr's stance. Closure is Charged Poise—the bell remains silent but is now listening, reconfiguring the premise with conceptual cost (she may dissolve). The "Throughout the evolution" refrain teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. One meaningful tightening (from observation to launch) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: Helena notices patterns → investigates Marcus's account → finds shadow profiles → discovers the conspiracy → decides to act. The closure is a Charged Poise moment where she steps into the Nevada night with evidence, reweighting her role from keeper to exposer with the cost of her safety now legible. One issue: the warehouse revelation and "walked away" discovery arrive in summary rather than dramatized scene pressure, weakening the final turn's felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lighthouse orchard, peacekeeper, shadows, fragment). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mirrors accumulate glimpses of past mercy, the crystal reconstitutes via borrowed light, and the final image reweights Kira's relationship to her shadows. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadows shift from chains to companions, the crystal whole) with felt cost implied in the metaphor shift. However, cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible in the ending beat itself, only the assertion that she "would carry these glimpses with her now."

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered reflection and image (ice, parasol, waiting), teaching a pattern of drift and accumulation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise ("the waiting itself had become a kind of living"), but cost remains abstract—the Zurich appointment stays "on the calendar" without on-page forfeiture or a crystallized trade-off. The stroke provides a reversal (changed perception) but doesn't narrow options in a way that charges the final image with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, waiving that penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Marcus, pavilion, post-bus departure) within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered backstory, the burned fragment, and Sofia's parallel quest, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Marcus reframes his loss as "breadcrumbs for those who come after" with felt cost (ending his wait). One tightening occurs when Sofia's question about regret forces Marcus to articulate his own story. Cost is legible in the shift from solitary to shared witness, though the final image leans heavily on metaphor rather than a decisive physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, temporal frame). The drive lens reads as Causal: the line walker's decision to use the kinetic parapet enables the conjured clearing, which protects the voices from the prophet's fire. Closure lands on the page with the consecration complete and the murmuring preserved—a Decisive Change with felt cost (she walks away having preserved wisdom, the keeper weeps with relief). One escalation point (descent to the parapet, channeling voices, confrontation) tightens options. The cost is somewhat diffuse: she completes her mission successfully, but the story does not clearly foreclose a path or exact a visible price beyond effort expended.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: spring-to-autumn density builds through arcs, visitors, and gatherings, culminating in the mosaic assembly and the villagers reaching toward each other. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the collective healing crystallizes on the page with visible gesture). Cost is oblique but legible: twenty years of silence ended, the mosaic as public vulnerability. The story teaches its pattern early (arcs as connective threads) and the ending reweights prior material. Minor slip: Maren's personal cost remains abstract—her grandmother hid the photos, but Maren's own stake in healing is told, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when clearly in the opening paragraph (Elara, shadowed library, dawn, seventeen years post-dictionary). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the crystal experiments, botanical metaphor, and the final "Begin" reprise that reweights her discovery without a decisive external change. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she will keep her vigil—with the felt cost of continued isolation made undeniable in "a reticent scholar testifying to possibilities that no one else cared to hear." The linkage is more accretive than causal (language grows like trees, the crystal reveals hidden architecture), which fits the lens but limits escalation to a single deepening realization rather than multiple tightening turns.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Marcus, fog sculpture garden, present morning with a task. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through layered images (chalk wearing down, fog sculptures shifting, driftwood trail) that converge at the stone map. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marcus understands why prophecies erase themselves and accepts the mercy of forgetting with visible cost—he photographs knowing it will corrupt. The escalation is a meaningful tightening via density increase, and the cost is legible in the final image of returning empty-handed with only ghost dust.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with the spinning clock hand as anchor, and closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (the clock stilling, Mira's decision to stay). Orientation is prompt by paragraph two. The cost of staying is conceptually present (accepting her father's departure, releasing the need to "fix" him) but remains mostly told rather than shown as a tactical sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf's frequency stops the clock, reweighting Mira's understanding of her father's fate.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Situational lens with accumulative texture: Samuel waits for blood work results while repairing the broken record. Orientation is clean by ~80 words (Mira, hospice, Samuel's room). The closure unit is Charged Poise—Samuel turns to face the results with Mira, holding her hand, the repaired record as proof that "shattered things could still be holy"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a forfeited path or visible trade-off. The nurse's arrival and the "scent of hope" function as mood rather than a dramatized reconfiguration that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (floating isle, observatory, Mira) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure unit—shadows beginning their return as Mira completes sealing runes—registers as a Decisive Change, but the cost is conceptual and diffuse ("ready to face whatever came next") rather than felt on the page. The automaton's awakening provides answers that Mira accepts without friction, flattening causality into exposition. The "loops" metaphor in the final line gestures at thematic resonance but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered revelations (tooth → bones → decision) that reweight Eleanor's certainty, landing in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she commits to finding Charlotte with visible cost: abandoning her "carefully ordered life" and professional certainty. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The escalation operates through density increase and pattern shift rather than causal narrowing, consistent with the lens. One meaningful deepening (the bones discovery) alters her stance with felt cost in the final paragraph's commitment, though the closure skirts close to summary rather than a crystallized final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated polishing motions, memory fragments, and sea-glass arrangement toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—she accepts sharing over solitary watching, foreclosing private grief with the cost of exposure). Orientation anchors quickly (grotto, Maren, memory work). The spiral creation and decision to leave it constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights her relationship to loss. Cost is visible: she walks away from her private sanctuary, opening it to strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira in data center, three weeks post-viral confession). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (moss patterns, drip lines, intertwined ferns) and the confession's public weight, culminating in the pendant offering—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the sisters' options reweight without full resolution. Cost is felt in Mira's relinquishment and Thea's tearful acceptance. One tightening deepens the reconciliation stakes sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nexus functions as a liminal space framing Elena's confrontation with abandoned characters; the closure image (picking up the pen, writing the first sentence) delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost—committing to vulnerability on the page. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: encounter → solemnization → epiphany → action. However, the turn hinges on a character's articulated thesis ("hope isn't a destination") rather than a dramatized reversal, weakening causal pressure. The spiral motif recurs purposefully, and the final act alters Elena's stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through the dying vines, lunar alignment, grandmother's journals, and song toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the vines pulse green, Mira commits to teaching others). Closure effect is on the page with felt cost ("a single morning could not undo decades of forgetting"). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraphs. One structural hiccup: "Mira spins golden stories into the morning" mid-scene is a third-person observation that briefly breaks POV modesty, creating a micro-causality wobble, but the accumulative design and charged final image hold the lens through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the spiral pattern, starlight application, and sealing ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the map sinks into the ground, the aurora moves again). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is legible—a felt shift in the orchard's potential—but the cost remains implied (aching knees, throbbing fingers) rather than a decisive forfeiture that reweights her future. One meaningful deepening is present; causality holds under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers observations, failed attempts, and incremental understanding across three months, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the harvest occurs and Elena sits "with the marble, the mechanism, and the memory of voices." Orientation is clean by opening lines (marble cavern, three months descent, autumn-to-winter). The cost is conceptual and felt—wonder captured but not explained, mystery held in notation—visible in her "notebook full of phonetic transcriptions." One meaningful deepening (the timer clicks into wholeness, voices emerge) suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens. Closure remains open but charged, fitting the declared aim to "store wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's boundary-less state calcifies into structure through labor, with visible cost (absorbing burdens, pressing the weaving into stone). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered echoes, the weaving process, and the final exchange with the grotto. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the fractals learn to end where she begins, reweighting her initial trap into a navigable structure. Cost is legible in the transformation and the burdens she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (loft, skylight, kettle, Viktor's studio-turned-workshop). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered reflections and the recurring lion motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Marguerite's peace is crystallized—"perhaps this was enough"—with visible cost (the life she no longer has with Viktor). The tightening is a single deepening rather than a causal reversal, fitting the lens. However, the closure image lacks a sharp final price or foreclosed option made undeniable on the page; the cost is largely retrospective rather than a visible forfeiture in the ending beat, preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira reconfigures her stance toward ambition with visible cost (acknowledging fear rather than choice). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (kinetic lagoon, scavenger role, ghost). Causal lens holds: overheard fragment → new negotiation tactic → ghost's dissolution. One meaningful deepening (regret reframed from wisdom to fear) tightens options and forecloses pretense with felt cost in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Maya, Gate 47, post-carnival). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Maya's exploration through the terminal gathers density toward a final plan. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—she walks away with a plan and warm determination, but no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The resonant reconfiguration needed for RR (Charged Poise or Earned Stasis) doesn't materialize; the ending asserts forward momentum without dramatizing what she's risking or losing now.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's act of sketching new composition notes constitutes a stance crystallization that reweights her seventeen-year abandonment with visible emotional cost (tears, acknowledgment of "terrifying burden"). The accumulative design—layered memories, subconscious notation in margins, news of the weakening enchantment—coheres and tightens once through the realization that her dream "had been listening...all along." Cost is legible in the final image: she commits to wait "half a lifetime" with no guarantee of success, and the work will remain silent "for now, but not forever."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren retrieves the evidence, reads the letter, and faces the decision of what to do with truth, crystallizing options with felt cost. The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage—coordinates lead to evidence, evidence reframes her father's mythology, the letter reconfigures her inheritance as the ability to see clearly. The barge's forward momentum into "canals she had never traveled" charges the final image with undeniable pressure and unresolved consequence. One meaningful tightening (discovery narrows her understanding) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through rope-decoding, fog cycles, and seed-to-knowledge parallels, culminating in the invitation/test discovery that reweights Mira's solitary collection practice into communal seeking. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her shift from passive preservation to active transmission with visible cost (abandoning her solo method). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mira, dock, collection pouch, harbor). One meaningful deepening occurs when the rope's final knot sequence transforms from fishing lore into a weaver summons, narrowing her path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, the ritual of writing, and recurring imagery (thread, garden, autumn). Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, garden, post-ship departure). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elara completes the obituary, understands healing as practice, and commits to continue her work with Matthias's memory integrated. Cost is felt in the seven pages written, the cold endured, and the departure toward an uncertain harbor. Escalation reads as deepening rather than causal tightening, consistent with the lens. One reservation: the epiphany ("healing was not a destination but a practice") arrives somewhat cleanly without friction in the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page: Aldric's activation creates a hybrid creature and triggers palace-wide disorder—a Decisive Change with visible cost (the irreversible alteration of the mechanical order). The causal chain is clear: forbidden texts → apparatus assembly → egg activation → transformation. Orientation anchors early (palace, observatory, prince). One meaningful tightening when he admits the flaw yet proceeds, narrowing his options to risk or renunciation. Cost is legible in the final image: "improperly, magnificently, irrevocably."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece is oriented (firefighter at volcanic lagoon during cloud migration) and the accumulative/textural lens is legible by midpoint. However, closure lacks an on-page decisive change or reconfiguration with felt cost; Mara's walk away repeats her existing stance rather than crystallizing a new one. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies: "who, where, when" anchors arrive cleanly by paragraph two, but the waiver cannot apply because the disorientation does not charge closure—the final image reiterates theme without reweighting prior material through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors early (geese frozen three days ago, city of fountains, memory wells). The causal chain is legible: crystallized memories → follow breadcrumbs → find key → release memories → geese resume flight. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (individual memory dissolves into the communal stream), and the inferred lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture. However, the amber shattering and memory release feel somewhat mechanical—the key fits, the problem solves—without a final friction or choice that would deepen the cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through nested metaphors (civilizations, falling petals, stored light) and the gear's discovery pattern, culminating in a cadence shift when resonance replaces fire. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the dominant stake (light vs. fire) with conceptual cost legible in "most civilizations would still choose fire." One persistent constraint (the gear's frequency mechanism) shapes the final tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate for closure quality. However, the turn itself—gear clicks, resonance spreads—feels more inevitable than earned by prior resistance, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. The accumulative lens holds: each evening's teaching deepens understanding until the final sketch crystallizes collective grief's architecture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's realization that "collective grief was simply love made visible by absence" reweights all prior instruction with conceptual cost (she must now carve differently). The three-week timeframe and "until the last butterfly crosses" promise create forward pressure, but the escalation reads more as steady accumulation than tightening crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring imagery (obsidian, pendulum, seventeen seconds) until the carving reweights the entire liturgy of guilt. Orientation anchors clearly (ridge, tower, village) by paragraph two. The closure—Maren carving her confession and releasing the handle—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with palpable cost: acknowledgment without forgiveness, "seventeen seconds resting lighter." The felt price is undeniable in the final image of her walking home with the shared liturgy against her hip.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to a small causal turn) and delivers on-page closure: Mira decodes the coordinates and decides to return with a spade. Orientation anchors arrive early (silo, Mira, letter). The cost, however, is implied rather than felt—no visible forfeit or tactical shift accompanies the discovery. The chess-clock framing device is elegant but remains metaphorical rather than constraining action. One meaningful tightening (untangling → coordinates → decision) is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph: who (Mira), where (obsidian spire above frozen lake), and the commission (map time itself). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story accrues pressure through layered reflection and image—the spire, the feather quill, the frozen Engine below—culminating in the act of writing maps labeled as conjecture. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira completes the maps and descends with humility intact, crystallizing the distinction between invitation and command. The cost is conceptual and felt—she has dared to write the future while acknowledging uncertainty—but the story does not show a live tactical choice where writing risks her livelihood, reputation, or internal philosophy in a way that she might plausibly refuse. The final image reweights prior material, but the stakes remain stable rather than narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Helena continues broadcasting despite risk, and the piece demonstrates that memory is "banked, waiting for someone diligent enough to coax it back to flame." Cost is visible in her solitary life, constant patrol evasion, and the ongoing danger. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through examples (blacksmith humming, children drawing) and the cadence shifts at the ending from broadcast urgency to quiet resolve. One friction: the "dust learning to speak/remember" metaphor drifts slightly abstract in places, but the concrete broadcast mechanics and listener responses anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marina accepts the inheritance and re-animates the chair, foreclosing any path away from grief work with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (ash mixing, mask warming, vanishing point pulsing) and the final rocking restores presence through pattern. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (Marina, gallery, grandmother's death). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina dons the mask and the gallery transforms, reweighting her understanding of the work's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (cataloging artifacts through sedimentary layers). Orientation anchors are clear early. The closure—sealing the cog and carving the forbidden date—offers a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: preservation as rebellion), but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The piece accumulates texture through layers and objects, yet the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material; it restates the established pattern without a meaningful cadence shift or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The story operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through layered reflection on cultural loss, institutional decay, and personal grief, then deepens when Darius arrives and requests teaching. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of teacher and student beginning "the slow work of preservation" reweights the resignation into active transmission with felt cost (Margaret must teach what she thought lost, Darius must engage grief). One meaningful tightening occurs when Darius's request transforms stasis into action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain (three-moon alignment → plant seed → tree grows → harvest before dawn) and orientation anchors arrive early. However, the core pressure dissolves at the moment of planting: the seed "began its work" without resistance, the tree rises without complication, and Maren's agency is passive observation rather than decision under constraint. The closure unit—walking away with seeds and revolution in mind—gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract ("the regime's sensors would detect") rather than felt on the page. The "by dawn" time limit is declared but never dramatized as a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira returns to her post having shared the tower's secret, foreclosing solitary preservation but affirming communal wonder with visible cost—the matchbox now passes to the next traveler. The causal spine holds: blackout → frozen gate → woman arrives because power failed → Mira's involuntary truth forces revelation → residual charge saves bees → matchbox left behind reweights the opening riddle. Orientation anchors (Mira, tower, amber sky, blackout context) arrive within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's truth-telling compulsion intersects the woman's need, narrowing options and raising emotional cost. The piece infers as Causal with lyric texture; the lens holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight that witnessing sanctifies), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract—no concrete on-page price (social, relational, or opportunity) is legible in the final image. The closing paragraph restates the insight without dramatizing a foreclosed option or visible trade-off, leaving closure asserted rather than landed.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (diver, underwater garden, day 73). The piece operates under a Causal lens with Accumulative textures: Mira's certainty cracks through cascading revelations, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (nuanced possibility replaces rigid certainty). The closure unit—Mira ascending with the ampoule and new understanding—lands with felt cost (her brother's death reframed, her mission transformed). One meaningful deepening occurs when Veris extends the ampoule and Mira receives her brother's final thoughts. The cost is emotional and relational but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (dice, crack, equations, father's silence) that converge at the crack discovery and seal. Orientation anchors (infinite staircase, Vera alone, timeless present) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise variant—where Vera reaches "the other side" yet remains confined, and her grief now functions as perpetual engine; the cost (permanent entrapment with only the hum of captured grief) is felt in "she hadn't escaped" and the final image of endless climbing. One meaningful deepening occurs when the crack opens and she presses through, reweighting her quest from escape to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya receives confirmation, cries, and commits to continuing her work with the brush. However, the cost is abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts, and the email arrival is coincidental timing rather than causal pressure. The waxing moon return and methodically hopeful echo charge the final image, but the reconfiguration reweights existing conviction rather than altering Maya's stance or options with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph: Mira behind the waterfall, seventeen years, beekeeper absent three seasons. The accumulative lens dominates: pressure accrues through sensory layering (rosewater dread, honey depletion, thaw imagery) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira commits to tomorrow's pigment lesson despite no rescue, reweighting persistence as defiance rather than waiting. Cost is legible: the children's innocence and the community's dwindling resources frame the stakes, and Mira's decision to teach symbols on stone walls forecloses hope of surface return. One micro turn—Petra's giggle breaking despair—sets up the ending without fragmenting the dominant accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: hunger stone coordinates → lighthouse → yoyo → disassembly → reassembly → portal to daughter's laughter. Orientation anchors appear within the first ~100 words (Alaric, island, lighthouse, toolbox, hunger stone). The closure unit is a Decisive Change—Alaric crosses through a temporal door and disappears—with cost implied (he's "already gone," the path is hidden). The cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page; we're told he's chasing his daughter but don't witness a trade-off or forfeiture that makes the price undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Vera in the funhouse, post-drowning, seeking the advisor. The drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture: paradoxical definitions destabilize fear's footing, dream confrontation forces the entity to see itself, Vera consumes it. Closure lands on-page ("empty chest," "mouth that tasted of ash and victory") with visible cost (the clasp "no longer tarnished, as if fed"). One meaningful turn when fear shakes at its own reflection. The mechanism (dream dictionary creating "impossible spaces") feels somewhat convenient—introduced and resolved within the single encounter—but the because/therefore chain holds and the ending reconfigures her relationship to dread with tangible aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images and sensory density around the orchard-as-instrument motif, and the final paragraph attempts a cadence shift ("The sea took everything eventually, but she had learned to take it back"). However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the Prophet's work tonight (assessing the hull fragment) is deferred to "tomorrow," and the ending restates her established practice without visible cost or a decisive change. Closure reads as summary rather than a charged moment that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page via Charged Poise: Mira rows toward the watchers with the whistle ready, crystallizing her commitment to understanding over safety. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—details about the gate, patterns, her father's message, and the watchers build density until her departure reweights all prior material. Orientation anchors (cartographer, turtle city, rusted gate) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the watcher tilts its head, proving responsiveness and forcing Mira's final choice. Cost is legible: she abandons the city and its drowsy safety.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The causal lens holds: petal drop signals readiness → evidence compilation → upload decision → departure. The closure is a Decisive Change (she uploads the files and walks away), with visible cost (Institute's work will crumble, painful fallout acknowledged). One orientation note: the coordinates-from-mentor setup creates mild retroactive scaffolding, but the main sequence is motivated. Cost is legible in "It would not be painless" and the torch-through-darkness image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates artifacts (inkwell letter, photograph) and the closure deposits a note in response, creating a pattern of care across time. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marina continues her ritual with visible cost (solitude, the "negative space" she inhabits)—but the cost could be more visceral on the page. The linkage between finding the photograph and leaving the note is causally clean within the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the blackout establishes stakes (opportunity to hear the library breathing). The closure—stamping her entry and adding Celia's name—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she reclaims stillness and continuity). Cost is present but oblique: she carries forward the gift of stillness, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the ledger, reweighting the stamp's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who/where/when by ~150 words) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—grief transformed through craft and ritual. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mei's grief becomes "light" and "presence"), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: she simply succeeds, sleeps peacefully, and the garden approves. The escalation from folding cranes to building the lantern to capturing the shadow follows a clear arc, but the final beat lacks felt consequence—no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, just luminous resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Yara's isolation, the geode's shifting weight from intangible to real, and the spike on the readout deepen her obsessive hunt without requiring a causal reversal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights "unused potential" as "not the same as wasted hope" and the geode becomes "impossibly, unbearably real," crystallizing her endurance with felt cost. The middle deepens but doesn't tighten options as sharply as the high band requires; the coordinates are recorded with trembling fingers, but no tactical shift follows on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: Mira's search → signal discovery → chip combination → map revelation → new coordinates. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (pilgrim, observatory, dusk). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (continuation over closure), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—Mira simply "began walking toward the next observatory" without visible forfeiture or tactical constraint. The dominant stake (decode the signal/find father) shifts to a meta-cartographic mission in a single expository paragraph, weakening the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—Maren's decision to reconstruct what she destroyed forecloses her old path with visible cost (loss of detachment, acceptance of unpayable debt). The piece operates under a Causal lens with accumulative texture: the letter revelation → nightly penance → carved hand discovery → spoken confession → commitment to repair. Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful tightening occurs when the carved hand crystallizes her withheld truth and forces the vocal confession, narrowing options from silent evasion to active atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation lands within the first 120 words (Mira, watchtower, prisoner exchange). The causal lens dominates: Mira's refusal to let her brother speak immediately forecloses easy reconciliation and crystallizes the road-still-to-walk stance. The exchange itself is a micro turn; the true closure is Earned Stasis—she defers his apology, making visible the cost (unresolved tension, deliberate distance). One meaningful tightening occurs when both prisoners cross and she pulls the drawer pull a final time, fulfilling its anchoring purpose. Cost is felt in the brother's gaunt face and the silence that follows them off the parapet.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (fog, compass, utility poles) and cadence shifts until the final paddle reweights her relationship to navigation and grief. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (coastal kayak launch, November, Elena alone). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she tucks the broken compass back and continues forward, choosing ongoing motion over dramatic disposal; the cost is accepting imperfection and uncertainty as permanent conditions. The escalation is modest—single deepening rather than multiple reversals—but the ending image ("The water carried her, as it always had") reconfigures prior material with felt weight. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early and pays it off, though one more concrete turn in the middle third would tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (Marcus, underground lake, three weeks post-procedure). The drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texturing: breadcrumb clues lead Marcus to the lake, Elena's revelation narrows his options, and the final choice to enter a tunnel constitutes Charged Poise—options crystallize, algae respond to honesty, and the cost (navigating internal maze) is undeniable on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena reframes his erasure as a deficit requiring empathy-building labor. Minor slip: the baseball's impossible date (2089) introduces a speculative element that the story acknowledges but does not fully integrate into the closure mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story anchors who/where/when early and delivers on-page closure: Mira's transformation forecloses her human life with visible cost (she "would never again walk unnoticed through human markets"). The causal lens holds—spices conjure Kael, metamorphosis enables contact—but the escalation is thin: spice arrangement leads directly to transformation without meaningful reversal or complication. The fortune's prophecy ("What fire separates, smoke reunites") reads as poetic ornament rather than earned wisdom because we never see Mira decode it or test alternate interpretations; it simply proves correct at the moment of use, weakening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear anchoring (midnight glade, three years post-birth) and builds through layered image work (cards, saucer, cord). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Morrigan recovers lost moments and commits to presence, reweighting her relationship to motherhood. However, the cost is largely retrospective understanding ("too exhausted... to hold it all") rather than a present forfeiture, and the final image—Iris waiting with grandmother—feels arranged for emotional satisfaction rather than earned through on-page pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the card-door opens, but the stakes never tighten into a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure unit—pouring the vessel and opening the dimension—is on the page with cost (forty years, solitary labor, final self-confrontation), and the causal lens holds: shadow work → tears → unlocking. Orientation anchors quickly (spaceship, Mei Lin, post-humanity). One meaningful tightening occurs when she confronts her own photograph, narrowing options to complete the task. The cost is legible in her decades of work and the emotional price of integrating her buried anger, though the final image leans slightly abstract ("starlight," "light remained") where a sharper physical consequence would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening lines (who, where, what). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the ritual release of fireflies, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Miriam "felt the texture of transformation under her fingertips" and realizes "the prophecy had never been about destination. It was about release." The cost is oblique—she remains destitute, but the resolution feels more meditative than decisive, and the geologist's detour reads as coincidence enabling rather than complicating the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with accumulative patterning in the recruitment phase. Orientation anchors (Maren, Eastern Gate, twilight blackout) land cleanly in the opening. The closure—Maren's return to her post with revolution set in motion—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The because/therefore chain (discovery → recruitment → blackout → messengers departing) holds, though the middle recruitment phase is summarized rather than dramatized, creating a causality gap between setup and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. Orientation anchors quickly (tidal bluff, aurora, three days post-friction loss). The closure—Meren completing the reverse sequence using the eels—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she fulfills the promise, the eels begin to dance, and the aurora sings, crystallizing her shift from evasion to creation. Cost is felt (her anonymity sacrificed, her curse finally harnessed) and the accumulative density (painted rocks, star dust, eel formations) reweights the opening stake. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the reversal of friction via living geometry is causally seeded. No causality breaks; the piece teaches its pattern early and holds it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: storm imagery, timer countdown, and the sealed envelope converge to reweight Elena's silence into speech. The closure—Elena speaking into the storm—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (ending a vigil), and the cost is legible (seven years of silence broken, exposure risked). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The escalation is a single meaningful deepening rather than causal reversal, appropriate to the lens, though the photograph's revelation feels more like a permission slip than a constraint that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with action-adventure mechanics. Orientation anchors arrive early (atrium, waiting, Ambassador). The closure unit—Elara standing "among shattered teacups," overture "no longer hidden"—asserts a Decisive Change but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what she sacrificed or which path closed. The intercept-decode-confront sequence links causally, but the climactic duel is summarized ("When it ended") rather than dramatized, flattening the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds atmosphere and thematic weight through recurring images (stars, rust, books, tin) rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (rusted library, Mira, tonight). However, no meaningful on-page escalation occurs; Mira and Ezra sort books as they always have, and the final image ("Always together. Always under stars.") affirms stasis without visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. The closure reads as Charged Poise in intent but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than dramatized, and no felt price lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The story accumulates pressure through film discovery → coordinate decoding → piano-as-beacon → craft arrival, tightening once meaningfully when Elara realizes the compasses need her signal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis converted to reunion) with visible cost: the clock stops permanently, its receiver's purpose complete, and seventeen years of solitary waiting reweighted by "we surprised it together." Cost is legible in the clock's final stillness and the "steely longing finally permitted to soften."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection on memory-preservation, the seed's properties, and the approaching monsoon, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Yara's planting and acceptance of uncertainty reweights her role with felt cost—she abandons verification as her mission. The cost is legible: "something in her that she had spent seventeen years trying to verify into silence." One meaningful deepening through the dream-vision that changes her stance suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through Mei's sequential understanding of the lace pattern, compass warming, and final shared gesture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the two women point to knots in the lace, the compass stills, and the charged image reweights fifty years of silence with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Mei, islet, post-storm, three months post-stroke). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mei traces the pattern and the compass points toward the cottage, narrowing her path to confrontation. Cost is felt but not paid in forfeited options—this is poise, not a decisive physical turn.

Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of memories shapes tactics. The closure unit lands on the page with undeniable emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    Plot follows a causal lens with tight linkage; closure is a decisive change featuring Mira's success and her mother's presence, with cost legible in the collector's dismay. Orientation is early and clear, and the structure coheres without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Elena chooses community over isolation, with cost legible in her mixed feelings; the causal lens holds tightly, linking thawing ice to power restoration and her resolve. Orientation is clear within 120 words (who, where, when), and the persistent constraint of melting ice shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending reconfigures options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal drive lens holds tightly from DNA discovery to seashell clues to confrontation, with orientation anchored early. Closure is a decisive change—Sandra's confession and Marla's recording—legible cost in "confession spilling like rust from corroded metal." Persistent constraint (phobias) shapes tactics, and no causality breaks mar the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative lens holds; closure via conceptual repricing (void as navigable) with cost in star's death and her effort; orientation clear and structure tight.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under the accumulative/textural lens, closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Unit-7 accepts the eternal return, with cost legible in the violin's dissolution. The loop structure is taught early and pays off, and orientation is anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (thawing mistrust) with felt cost in the exchange of lens and drawing; the accumulative/textural lens holds, reinforced by the crystal acoustics whispering the moment. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the wordless world shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in "That was enough." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through marble and garden patterns to Esther's revelation. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality is tight, with the climax arising from established backstory and character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    Plot follows a causal drive lens with strong linkage; closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Mira's realization of time as an ocean reweights the premise with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the magnetic nexus anomaly propels the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages: water damage reveals clues, leading Clara to decode and find evidence. Closure is a decisive change (retrieving documents and planning to disrupt history) with felt cost (physical discomfort and emotional resolution). Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Cassandra's decision to "give them nothing" forecloses a path, carrying the weight of her silence. The causal lens holds tightly, driven by her vision and recovery. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the persistent constraint of her fault-tolerant nature shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where Marcus's realization reweights the premise of erased truths, with felt cost legible in the image of him touching the bead and turning back. The causal drive lens holds tightly, with because/therefore linkages from discoveries to his decisive change. Orientation is anchored early, and the structure coheres without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative lens holds strong, with closure as Earned Stasis—Maren's renunciation forecloses intervention with cost in "she would become part of the accumulated silence." Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens coheres without ambiguity, with the origami swan's method shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in Maya's crying and smiling, under the accumulative/textural lens. The locket and roots shape tactics, and orientation is clear early. No causality breaks; the eclipse and conversation cohere toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Plot follows an accumulative/textural drive lens, with Maren's discoveries building to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the axis's true nature reweights the premise.

Orientation is anchored early, and the dome mechanism payoff is earned. Closure lands decisively with the map revelation, shaping Mira's new path.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost—her resolution to seek the girl's family reconfigures her path after the carved hand triggers her confession. The causal lens holds tightly from letter to ritual to object discovery, with orientation anchored early. The persistent constraint of guilt shapes tactics, and cost is legible in her weeping and the "work ahead."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration under the causal lens, as the exchange alters the sibling relationship with felt cost in the "road they would have to walk." Orientation is clear early, and the neutral territory constraint shapes tactics. The moon phase synchronization adds causal linkage without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with Elena continuing forward, cost legible in "faith flickered... fragile, but still lit." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details to the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise with Marcus choosing a tunnel, reconfiguring options under the causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality tightens from clues to revelation to maze. Cost is legible in the algae's response and his fear, with the maze as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Plot follows a causal drive lens with coherent because/therefore linkages, culminating in a decisive change where Mira's metamorphosis allows reunion with Kael. Closure lands with visible cost in her lost humanity and gained cosmic intimacy. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The accumulative structure builds through memory images to a closure where Morrigan reclaims lost time, with cost legible in her weeping. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds consistently without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands decisively with cost as the dimension opens, under an accumulative lens that holds throughout. The orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of shadow work shapes tactics. The final image of the ship drifting into the healed dimension reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration: Miriam's release of the fireflies and realization that transformation is continuous motion. Cost is legible in her destitution and the vibrating hum of wings. The accumulative drive lens holds, with patterns building to closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the prophecy fulfillment feels intentional, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as messengers depart, irreversibly cracking the Duke's foundation under a causal lens; the cost is legible in Maren's silent return, and orientation is clear within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    Plot follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: friction disappearance forces Meren to seek answers, leading to her vision and decision to reverse the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in a single visit, with backstory and cosmology woven in as reflections triggered by objects. The global drive feels accumulative/textural: each observation of dust, decay, and memory thickens until her closing reconfiguration of what she’s here to do. Closure lands in her decision to keep a slide, consign the rest, and reframe the experience as part of an ongoing process rather than a dramatic break. The piece is intentionally low on overt event but internally coherent, with no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival in canyon → contemplation with backstory → frost-code revelation → decision about future work and relationship to patrons. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with the near-death and the ledger logically feeding into the canyon vigil and the final choice. Closure is a conceptual repricing plus decisive change: she renounces her old patronage model and redefines her art’s purpose with visible cost to her prior life. The frost mirroring the smuggler’s code is a convenient device but reads as a stylized, quasi-mystical hinge rather than a plot hole.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrive in the conservatory with a goal, methodically test specimens, discover their “music,” and reach a reconfigured understanding of listening. Causality is intact and easy to follow, with the capsize → silence → research → conservatory visit chain clear from the outset. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she starts humming, sees her own warmth mapped, and reframes her project as learning a new language rather than restoring the old one. The main weakness is that the story’s middle feels more like steady texture than a sharpened turn; there’s no strong mid-scene pivot that clearly tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal throughline—from receiving the kelp-wrapped package to repairing the lens by conducting funerals—is clean and legible, with no orientation issues. The “seven nights” sequence compresses middle action but still reads as a coherent escalation, and the closure (lens whole, Ezra altered) lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost. The only soft spot is that the montage nature of the work among the drowned slightly smooths over opportunities for more sharply dramatized turning points. Nonetheless, the structure suits the length and supports the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is modest but clean: sanctions → anonymous drops → Mira’s organized runs → post-run gathering → new envelope and photograph. The story works under an accumulative/situational lens, with pressure coming from ongoing scarcity and danger more than discrete plot turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph plus new coordinates reweight the existing pattern of runs with sharpened hope and implied cost to continue. The structure is linear and legible, if somewhat low-tension in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single, well-oriented scene framed by a concise but potent past-life backstory that clearly tilts the present. Causality is coherent—past memory → present understanding → intervention → visible transformation—and the closure offers a resonant reconfiguration of the premise (where unused love goes). The cost is gentler and more conceptual than visceral but still legible in the old woman’s catharsis and Mei-Lin’s clarified vocation. For an elite slot, the stakes could tighten one more notch, yet the accumulative, lyric drive holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense movement through the garden, interleaved with backstory and memory, converges on the central knot of bridges and the activation of the halo fragment. Causality is legible—retro-trap → fading photographs → search for hyperbolic geometry site → fragment use → self-dissolution—and the closure (her becoming part of time’s fabric) clearly reconfigures stakes and options. The drive lens is predominantly Accumulative/Textural, with a single decisive act at the end; the pattern is taught early and paid off. The only limitation is that opposition and potential alternative outcomes are mostly off-stage, so structural tension leans heavily on concept rather than concrete complications.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: ticking-clock demolition → puzzle to access the vault → confrontation with the scout → negotiated reprieve → retrieval and escape with the seeds. Orientation is established quickly (who, where, when) and the drive lens remains consistently causal. Closure lands with a decisive change (she obtains the seeds before demolition) plus a reconfiguration (mission broadens from communities to “the earth itself”) and the persistent constraint of her chains. The main softness is that the scout’s turnaround feels slightly quick and convenient for the pressure level implied.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous scene in the greenhouse, with well-anchored backstory woven through present action. The causal chain—bringing down the glass, preparing the forge, imprinting, then hearing the frequency and deciding to finish and send the device—is coherent and accumulative rather than episodic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina now possesses the sound of trust breaking and chooses a new stance toward her mother with evident cost. There are no orientation issues or lens confusions; the accumulative/textural drive holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: arrive → decode flower signals → execute the switch → exit with the jar, all under a clear time constraint. Causality holds, and the closure—a resonant image of departure with the moonbeams and a felt “before/after” in her relationship to destiny—is legible. However, the central heist is frictionless, with no real complication or reversal; everything goes according to plan, which flattens the arc’s dramatic contour. The promised risk (guards, value greater than the station) never meaningfully constrains tactics beyond a single coded signal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from arrival, to testing the power, to reimagining the bunker, to a concrete decision. Causality is straightforward—thaw allows access; power flicker proves viability; that proof unlocks a new plan and forces a choice. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend: she commits to walking down the mountain tomorrow and preparing the lab today, foreclosing continued hermitage. The cost and before/after are clearly legible without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: DNA results → seashell message → coordinates → confrontation → confession recorded. Backstory is anchored in present triggers (the shell, the photograph) and consistently reorients us to the now of the library scene. Closure lands cleanly with a decisive change in Marla’s options (confession in hand, new name to reclaim) and a resonant internal reconfiguration. No major orientation or lens ambiguity issues appear.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: past setup of the darkness and booklet, present-tense tower vigil, and a clear progression from waiting to mapping to departure. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the lengthening nights drive her to the fort; the last star’s story enables the map; its extinction reweights the world. Closure is solidly on-page with a Conceptual Repricing: the end of light becomes the beginning of navigable night, with her completed map as pivot. Stakes and cost are more conceptual than dramatized, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: courtyard → appearance of violin → backstory of the Program → present-tense choice to play → reconfigured understanding → return to sweeping. Causality holds under a textural lens: each reflection arises from a concrete cue (snow, violin, broom) and the closure unit (Unit-7’s repriced sweeping) lands clearly with conceptual cost. The looped timelines and Second Chance Program premise are integrated enough to justify the inevitability motif without overcomplicating the single-scene frame. A slightly sharper on-page hinge where playing the violin *risks* something (identity, stability) could raise the sense of structural consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that progresses from solitary habit to encounter, exchange, and a quiet relational shift. Causality is straightforward—Mira’s continued visits lead to seeing Theo, which leads to observation, then mutual offering, then joint drawing—and the closure beat (two figures stepping through together) lands clearly. The cost of change (Mira surrendering her lens, both exposing their inner states) is visible on the page. Stakes and scope remain modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: the Commission’s announcement reframes Esther’s world, the accumulating marbles and Elena’s assignment bring the latent lie to a head, and the walk into the maze culminates in a values choice. Structure is linear with one present-time scene supported by compact, relevant summary; the global drive reads as accumulative/textural, with motifs tightening toward a conceptual repricing of “luck.” Closure is strong: Elena’s decision to go back to the parks with a new understanding, and Esther’s return to polishing, form an Earned Stasis/RR with a legible before/after. Stakes are modest and intimate but fully coherent for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: twilight → opening the deck → setting up the scanner → anomaly appears → conceptual shift about time. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—she now “understood” time as an ocean, and this knowledge reconfigures her world and future choices. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal experiment plus accumulative image-work with cloudweavers and engines), and it holds consistently. The main limitation is that structural stakes and cost around the experiment’s success remain relatively low-key, keeping the arc strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: past fire and slander → Voss’s encoded truth → water damage revealing the code → Clara decoding and physically retrieving the evidence → her decision to expose it. Backstory is well-anchored in present stimuli (water stains, program, portrait) so the single-scene frame stays coherent. Closure lands cleanly with a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the hidden history becomes actionable truth, and Clara shifts from invisible accompanist to active agent. The only limitation is that external resistance is entirely offstage, so structural pressure feels more inevitable than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses a clean single-scene structure with backstory threaded in via present cues (fever, illustration, instruments) and lands a clear closure beat when Cassandra decides to tell the Consortium nothing. The drive lens feels primarily Situational/Accumulative: pressure accrues through the weight of the unsaid vision rather than external plot turns, and that pattern is consistent. Causality is coherent—fever, smudge, memory of the vision, Mira’s questions all point toward the choice—and the final image of the Consortium “measuring their own extinction” provides a resonant reconfiguration. The only ceiling is that the escalation remains mostly internal and could support one sharper external consequence or deadline without breaking the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: years of obsession → psychics’ clues → tunnel search → valve room discovery → counting → reconfiguration of the past and future vow. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never slips, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marcus’s belief about Daniela’s “running away” is overturned, and his mission reframed with an explicit cost in labor and confrontation ahead. The only thing holding this back from the very top tier is that external resistance is minimal, so the structure never needs to juggle competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens and maintains that structure cleanly: exploration → discovery of the refuge → integration of the swan’s method → acceptance of her place in the cycle. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis, with the future seeker and her own sedimentation reframing all prior witnessing. Causality is soft but coherent; each discovery leads naturally to a deeper attunement rather than a plotted turn. The main limitation is the lack of a pronounced tightening or concrete cost in the closing beats, which keeps the structural arc more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and causal: hike → eclipse onset → confession of fear → transfer of the locket and reframing of “wonder,” with each beat growing from the last. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with situational pressure from the eclipse timing; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Maya’s stance toward growing up and wonder is reweighted. The cost—Elena surrendering the keepsake and accepting her daughter’s coming departure—is clear on the page. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues, and the before/after is legible without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine (listening → learning of Elise → finding the tapestry → reconceiving the Silence → choosing to continue east) is clean and legible. The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure as conceptual repricing—recasting the displaced axis as the cause of the Silence and Maren’s work as map-making—lands clearly. There’s only one real structural turn and almost no obstacle or complication, which keeps escalation modest but coherent. Orientation is strong from the opening and the ending forms a distinct before/after in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a present-night frame, backstory interleaved via concrete anchors (the specs, the fortunes), and a closure beat where she decides to give the specs to the journalist and consciously orchestrate her own reclassification. Causality is modest but present—her prophetic track record draws the journalist, which forces a choice about the microfilm, which redefines her identity. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing rather than a hard plot turn, but the before/after of “keeper of dangerous knowledge” vs. “public eccentric” is legible. Stakes remain quiet and largely internal, which limits how hard the structural impact lands despite its elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: imminent possession → Marcus’s choice of rhetorical-exorcism → progressive weakening of the entity → anchor activation → release. The three-minute clock, loop pedal echoes, and completion of the ash-gray pattern provide a coherent build to a decisive change. Closure is solid: Elena is freed, the void is held at bay, and the conceptual reframing of doubt lands on the page with a felt cost in her tears and laughter. The only limitation is that the possession’s resistance feels a touch generic and quickly surmounted relative to the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one primary present-time scene at the spire with interleaved backstory that remains anchored and relevant to each on-page beat. Causality is clear under an accumulative/textural lens: grandmother’s fortune → life of fortune-writing → hollowing out → climb to spire → dawn experience → final reframing and descent. Closure lands with a clear conceptual repricing of “homesickness” and an earned stasis in her acceptance of a final fortune and the long descent. Stakes are modest but fully satisfied at this length without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: suspended defiance → tablet configurations → recognition of prior timelines → realization about the labyrinth → choosing acceptance and renewed movement. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when she reframes “conquering” as ongoing exploration and resumes flight under that new understanding. Causality is internally consistent, with the tablet’s behavior prompting each new layer of insight. The main limitation is that the cost of this new stance is mostly conceptual, not dramatized in any concrete trade-off or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single visit to the cavern that builds from arrival to ritual to reconfiguration, with clear because/therefore causality. The closure—a renewed stance toward silence and music, signaled by her taking the needle and imagining new teaching—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. There are no orientation issues; time, place, and stakes are anchored early and remain coherent. The arc is somewhat straightforward and low in external complication, but for a lyric, internal piece the progression is well-shaped and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: present-tense courtyard frame, anchored backstory about the quarantine and Mira’s long-term practice, then the arrival and rereading of the message leading to a clear before/after in her understanding. Causality holds—her past records + the anonymous message → recognition of pattern → realization of manufactured storms → decision to hide/copy journals and accept new danger. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she crystallizes a plan and stance, with the cost implied in surveillance and risk. It’s primarily situational/accumulative rather than plot-twisty, but for this length the single decisive deepening and charged exit image are sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival and setup, brief exposition with Dr. Vance, then an extended, focused present-moment sequence culminating in Maren opening the vial and reinterpreting scent and grief. Causality is straightforward under an accumulative lens—her arrival “because” of the coordinates and date leads to the blooming Silphium and the decision to open the vial. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with a new stance toward scent and grief, with the vial symbolically “for whoever might need them next.” Stakes remain mostly internal and contemplative, limiting the sense of structural urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: present action in the grotto, interwoven with Jerome’s backstory via the rope and the altered world after the beings’ arrival. Causality is coherent—Marcus comes seeking an answer about time, uses his method on the rope, invites the woman in, and ends in a reconfigured understanding that time accumulates as layered presence. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of the grotto filling with “accumulated presence” and Jerome smiling retrospectively reweights everything toward time-as-texture with conceptual cost. Structural risk is low—there’s essentially a single continuous scene with embedded reflection—but it’s clean and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-time scene in the greenhouse, one reflective detour to family bonfires that reorients the theme, and a return to the immediate attempt to play. Causality in a strict sense is light, but under an accumulative/textural lens the progression from failed playing → re-framing interruptions → new way of playing → revalued silence works as a tight, coherent arc. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: silence becomes “space between notes,” and tomorrow’s decision to play in town follows from that. Stakes remain modestly scaled and mostly internal, which slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present-moment grotto frame, backstory of the chemist’s memory, and a focused inhalation/climax leading to a reoriented stance. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each layer of setting and backstory compacts into the decision to breathe in fully and then leave the petal for someone else. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Vera’s relationship to her work and to feeling itself changes, with visible cost (loss of protective numbness) and a clear before/after. The scene stays coherent and anchored throughout with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: misdelivered letter → curiosity → meeting Elias → archival proof → joint campaign → public recognition. The structure uses a neat progression from inciting incident to montage-like middle to a ceremonial closure with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina moves from abstract inheritance to active stewardship, with a concrete outcome. The main limitation is that most obstacles (e.g., the historical society’s resistance) are summarized rather than dramatized, softening structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly legible: wandering → arrival at orchard → mystery of the tag → communal search → revelation of Senna → reconfiguration of belonging. Causality tracks (the marks appear after the elder’s death; the search, sculptures, and community effort lead to finding Senna), and the closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard decisive act. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative ritual/imagistic layering), held consistently to the end. The main limitation is that complications are smoothed over quickly, so turns feel more like gentle progressions than pressured escalations.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: pendant → search during Aldros’s nap → discovery of the cage → freeing echoes → cost and reconfiguration at the end. Causality is strong and legible under a mostly causal, slightly accumulative lens, and the closure (world rebalanced, Miriam depleted) lands on the page. The realization that echoes were imprisoned reweights earlier images of extinction effectively. The only soft spot is how effortlessly the cage dissolves, which slightly undercuts peak-beat resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and coherent: a single ritual scene framed by concise backstory that all points toward the orchard-working and its consequence. Causality is solid under an accumulative lens—the careful setup of equations, eyes, and dripping water leads naturally to the apparition and then to Mira’s realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the target of the “equation” shifts from Theo to her own grief, and that change clearly alters her future tactics. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the before/after is unmistakable and paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: outage → movement through infrastructure → grounding in caches → decision to plant a letter → quiet, reweighted final image. Causality is modest but coherent; the outage and tape-triggered memory motivate a new tactic rather than merely decorating atmosphere. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Maren redefines what “visibility” means and alters her pattern of behavior with a clear before/after. The cost of this shift (risking discovery) is implied but underplayed on the page, which keeps the structural arc strong rather than overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear orientation, and a tight causal chain from strange leaf → recognition of dream pattern → acknowledgment of bodily change → decision to surrender. The drive lens reads as accumulative/situational, and the closure—her conscious choice to stop resisting—is on the page with a legible before/after. The cost (the death of her prior self and the need to hide aspects from customers) is visible though understated. Slightly higher scores are held back by the relatively low external pressure; nothing in the environment forces a sharper, time-bound crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: lighthouse → rain cue → causeway → museum → brooch → Theo → shared artifacts → new painting, all linked by Mira’s pursuit of meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the same sleeplessness becomes “witness rather than punishment,” and the final causeway crossing neatly mirrors the earlier solitary ones. Causality is modest but coherent, with the rain-trail decision functioning as a clear inciting pivot. Stakes remain low-key and interior, but the before/after is legible and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: pilgrim’s visit → descent → confrontation with shadows/pearl → epiphany → return, with clear because/therefore links. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the cave’s song, shadows, and increasingly charged images build toward a conceptual reweighting at the end. Closure is strong via a clear before/after in Vera’s stance, with a visible cost in relinquishing her old way of living. There are no orientation problems; time and space remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: exile → return → resumption of work → widening impact on families → quiet reaffirmation at the lighthouse and desk. The accumulative drive (reconstructing the wreck, widening the circle of meaning) holds, and closure via a resonant reconfiguration—Elena reinstalled as keeper of absence—lands. Still, the key conflicts (corruption, exile) sit mostly off-stage in backstory, so the ending slightly reiterates an already-established state rather than marking a sharp on-page before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious device → deciphered journals → midnight vault → arrows → door → father, with each step motivated by prior knowledge or choice. Orientation is excellent from the opening and the single-scene structure is tight. Closure lands as a decisive change—she crosses the threshold and commits to charting family truths—with a coherent before/after. The emotional and practical costs of abandoning her old life are only lightly touched, keeping the ending from fully devastating impact.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → explanation → ritual → aftermath → departure, with clear causal links and no orientation debt. The accumulative drive—whale song, tile, transcription—builds toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard decision, which suits the piece. Closure lands in Mira’s altered stance and the charged object (journal) she carries away; the cost is implicit in her vulnerability and the uncertainty of success. The one limitation is that everything proceeds smoothly once she agrees, so pressure never meaningfully complicates the path.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: solar storm → disruption of prison and amulet → Vera’s realization and intrigue → spatial collapse → doorway → step into new state of being. The structure fits a single-shard causal lens with a clear Decisive Change and a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure has cost (she gives up eternity-as-she-knew-it and relinquishes the amulet and the hope of a simple reunion) and the before/after is legible. The only limitation is that opposition to her plan is thin, making the middle feel relatively unresisted even as it flows logically.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: stolen heirloom → father dying and requesting it → Maya confronting Mr. Chen → moral negotiation → the ink pot changing hands with a reframed sense of “even.” Closure is strong, landing on a conceptual repricing of fairness with clear before/after stakes for all three characters. Escalation is more ethical and emotional than event-driven but still coherent under a causal lens. The structure is solid if somewhat gentle in its turns, with no major orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous dawn ritual with integrated backstory, moving from ascent to observation to return. As an accumulative/textural piece, the primary “turn” is the slightly altered hum and the realization of this dawn joining the archive, culminating in the reaffirmation of her ongoing climb. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis image rather than a decisive change; the before/after is subtle but legible in how this specific dawn is folded into her practice. The lack of a sharper structural or causal pivot keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one night’s circuit through the port under an accumulative/textural lens, with backstory efficiently interleaved and a clear before/after in her resolve to act tomorrow. Causality is sound—her wandering → overheard talk → recognition of the poison notation → decision to seek the doctor—and the Meridian throughline holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she rests in readiness, with risk sharpened by her already-being “dead” in the system. The only limitation is that escalation and consequence remain mostly anticipatory rather than tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored, with a tight causal throughline from arrival → experiment with the cello → confrontation with past voices → reframed relationship to her work. The global drive reads as accumulative/textural with a situational core, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her life’s mission. The final descent, with her decision to return differently equipped, gives a clear before/after boundary and stakes that extend beyond the page. No major causality or orientation slips; the piece comfortably meets elite short-form expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: ferry/investors and changing graffiti set up pressure, leading to the resistance meeting, plan, new symbol, and Mira’s renewed mission. Causality is coherent (privatization threat → need to reorganize → resistance strategy → Mira’s specific tasks), and the ending lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she commits to a path with clear stakes and cost, even though the outcome remains open. The main weakness is that the key reorganization work and resistance conflict are mostly summarized (“They talked until dawn… hammering out plans”) instead of dramatized in a decisive on-page turn, which slightly softens closure impact. Orientation and lens are clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single continuous scene, tightly bounded by a live clock (forty minutes to dawn, then a 20‑second exposure) gives the piece a clean accumulative structure. Causality is simple but coherent: she travels, sets up, triggers chemicals, and completes the photograph just as darkness ends, with the satellite lights closing the thematic loop. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: she has preserved a threshold at the cost of accepting permanent loss and her own limited agency. There are no major orientation or logic slips, though the middle is almost entirely reflective, making the “turn” more tonal than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: merchant’s request → diagnosis → repair under time pressure → successful launch → quiet reaffirmation of purpose. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-scene structure fits the length and lens. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise moment when she sends the drone off and returns to her shop, but the decisive change is modest. Because the cost and consequence remain small and largely untested, the structural impact feels solid rather than compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: a single accumulating scene from falcon’s return to departure, with clear orientation and no causality slips. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid (causal decisions inside an accumulative, atmospheric build), held consistently through the end. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis moment: she chooses to walk onto the ice, foreclosing safety and embracing the quest. The one limitation is that the plot progression leans heavily on set-up and resolve with minimal on-page complication or testing of the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure—three ritual days, the collapse, then a 90-year jump to rebirth—is clear and satisfying, with a strong sense of before/after and an earned conceptual cost (the town’s sacrifice for future life). Causality is clean under a largely accumulative/textural lens: mapped footsteps → tuning fork strike → awakened bells → orchestrated collapse → eventual resurgence. The closure unit (the granddaughter stepping onto new cobblestones with the fork) reconfigures our understanding of “destruction” as seed-like transformation without resorting to explanation. There are no orientation issues, and the temporal jump feels purposeful rather than patching.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous dive framed by the three-century distress signal, discovery of the corpse, confrontation with the vial, and a reweighted ascent. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—her goal leads her deeper, the corpse reframes the risk, the knotted memories demand a different response, and that response redefines her mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she foregoes “proof” for testimony, with the cost of her career and the temple’s continued obscurity legible on the page. The oxygen clock and institutional pressure could be integrated a bit more tightly into mid-scene tactics, but they still bracket the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is cleanly causal: letters → lighthouse → confessional → discovery of carvings → manifestation of hush → tactical use of the lattice and naming → patrol’s arrival. Orientation (who/where/when) is firm very early, and the time constraint (“before they find the bodies,” dawn patrol) brackets the piece effectively. Closure lands as a decisive change: the hush-thing is destroyed and Milo emerges with evidence and a reconfigured social position, with the cost (risk, trauma, ongoing uncertainty) legible. If anything, the creature’s defeat feels a bit quick for the build-up, slightly undercutting climactic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: a present-tense ritual night, anchored backstory, a mid-beat revelation about the beads’ true purpose, and a decisive act leading to dawn. Causality holds under a mostly Causal lens: generations of tribute → resonant awakenings → Elias adding the last bead → Maren’s release and the night’s end. Closure is strong and on-page, with visible cost (Maren’s departure, Elias’s grief) and global consequence (the world’s sunrise). The only minor limitation is that success never feels seriously in doubt once the “stones are singing,” softening tension around the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: years of mapping lead to tonight’s convergence, she sews, the path takes, and dawn reveals the change in how the labyrinth works. Causality under a largely accumulative/textural lens holds—her preparation explains why this particular night matters and why the path can now exist. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s purpose is reweighted from prison to possible garden, with tradition broken and cost implied. The main limitation is that opposition never manifests as active resistance or genuine uncertainty about success, so the central turn feels assured rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clear: map → descent → orchard → tokens/journeys → sundial discovery → reconstruction → illumination → decision to carry seeds and base upward. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: she abandons her original debunking goal to complete and carry forward the pilgrimage. Time (“third day…another week”) gives a light but coherent structural spine. The main limitation is that external pressure remains low, so the climax feels more contemplative than sharply forced, which slightly mutes the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, anchored quickly in the golden arcade with a clear routine (chalk decoding → letter writing → mailing). Causality is intact but gentle; nothing meaningfully threatens the plan, and the extraction remains entirely offstage. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend: mailing the letter crystallizes her ongoing commitment and the delayed cost of her work. The lack of any complicating beat or on-page test of the mission’s stakes keeps the plot from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal structure is clean: eavesdropping → pattern recognition → realization of a purge → commitment to smuggle the warning, all contained in one coherent scene. Orientation is excellent from the outset; the drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture via recurring motifs. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she has reweighted the situation and chosen a path with clear implied cost, even if not yet enacted on-page. The one constraint is that the “coup in three days” clock and her concrete plan surface late, so the sense of narrowed options is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrival → guided journey → revelation of her own unsent words → re-visioning the fire → spoken apology → release from the labyrinth. Closure is strong and legible: she decisively shifts from silence to speech and the world responds (spirits carrying the apology, mangroves parting). The drive lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative lyric texture that holds consistently through the end. The scope is well-scaled for the length, with no dangling setups or confusing temporal jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single scene in the atrium with a clear through-line from anesthetic onset to being wheeled to surgery, with the encounter serving as the central action. Causality is modest but solid—her profession leads her to help, which reveals the “boats” message, which in turn reframes her guilt and her relation to memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices the coral and her own wound, with a legible before/after. Stakes are quiet but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulative scene in the dreamlike orchard, moving from arrival and setup, through active painting and integration of old and new techniques, to a reconfigured stance at the end. Causality is modest but coherent (commercial burnout → search in ruins → fragment and network → breakthrough in mural and emotion), and the closure beat (decision to keep returning, reframed understanding of joy) lands clearly. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and the pattern is consistent from start to finish. Stakes remain mostly internal and quiet, but the before/after of her relationship to art is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: failed attempts → new method (question via reflectors) → revelation → conceptual reconfiguration and a calm but firm ending choice. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens; each experiment with sound justifies the final, different tactic. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing: the mural is activated by wonder, and Margot’s role in the system is redefined. The cost is quieter (she relinquishes her original, results-driven mandate), which slightly softens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece is cleanly structured as a single causal scene: Marcus summons Sofia, reveals the seed and notebook, explains the code, and secures her commitment. Causality is intact and legible, and the closure lands as a charged poise—the decision to start planting encoded rebellion. However, the Bureau’s threat is kept mostly in exposition rather than enacted pressure, so the cost at the end feels more conceptual than immediate. Within this scope, the arc is coherent and complete, but not yet maximally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: we move from present singing to layered history and back, building toward a conceptual reconfiguration via the postcard realization. Causality is clean—war trauma → shell refuge → insomnia/poetry → blossom armistice → ongoing sanctuary—culminating in the understood meaning of “somewhere beautiful” and her choice to persist. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: beauty is reconceived as something built, and that realization reframes all prior images with a legible emotional cost. Escalation is gentle rather than sharply peaked, but the structural arc is sound and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from library exposition to the ascent and ritual, culminating in the tube’s restoration and the seeding of orchids. Causality is straightforward and legible—cracked tube → journey to restoration chamber → lullaby-as-trigger → machine’s activation → names preserved. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world of regret is reweighted by the new exhibit of “finding what you thought was lost forever,” with visible emotional cost in her tears and ongoing work. The only limitation is that external resistance is minimal, so the path feels relatively unopposed even though the internal/emotional stakes are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Maren’s invitation → the archive and Veth’ari premise → mutual confessions → decision to stay and translate. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they move from calcified estrangement to a fragile renewed collaboration with clear before/after. Stakes are modest but coherent, and the “until morning” clock gives structure without confusion or drift.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal throughline is clean: letter → journey to volcano → forensic envelope test → decoded confession → new understanding → forward plan. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never lost, and the dam backstory, while told in a block, is logically anchored to Mira decoding the letter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her options are reweighted by new knowledge and she chooses strategic silence with a visible moral cost. The main limitation is that the decisive threat (consortium power over the villages) is entirely historical/offstage, so present-tense danger feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure—flight to the attic, ritualized present, meteorite arrival, Mira’s entrance, confession, then journaling—builds cleanly toward a resonant reconfiguration without confusion. Causality is subtle but firm: corporate scandal → reinvention → attic rituals → meteorite as mirror → Mira’s questions → Elara’s choice to speak and then write. Closure is clear and on-page: beginning a journal and the recharged meteorite image mark a before/after with emotional cost. The design is quiet and largely internal, but there are no orientation or lens slips, and the final beat properly gathers prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: a present-time drift on the terrace, a braided backstory of the maze and pilot, and a causal resolution where understanding reconfigures options and prompts a decisive crossing. The causal chain—bench → logbook → weather codes-as-prayers → recognition of threshold → father’s renewed search → terrace stopping/threshold opening—is legible and satisfying within a mythic logic. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change with conceptual repricing: the maze’s role is reinterpreted and Wren’s situation is no longer static. The only softness is the slightly convenient simultaneity of the father’s sudden decision to search, which leans on fable logic rather than dramatized buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: descent → collaboration → shared witnessing → resurfacing, with orientation and stakes legible from early on. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Marina surfaces with a changed understanding of belonging and a concrete tether (email, coordinates) to this new rhythm. Causality is modest but sufficient—each step flows from the last, with no glaring gaps or conveniences. The cost is quiet (turning away from old structures toward a more solitary, uncertain path), but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: descent → recollection → discovery of seeds → experimental layering → reinterpreted path → ascent with reconfigured grief. Causality is consistent even within a lyric, conceptual frame, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis around “not-finding” with visible emotional cost. The ticking clock of dissolving memories is mostly front-loaded, but the need for answers before fading still shapes her urgency. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural and holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored in time and place, with a coherent build from preparation to payoff. The accumulative/textural drive—layering plans, environment, and audience response—lands in a resonant final image of her walking away into the arcade, philosophy affirmed. Closure is present as a conceptual reconfiguration (her stance toward randomness clarified), but the change is subtle and low-cost. The piece reads polished and complete, if more meditative than dramatically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: Kira arrives, states her desire, receives terms and warning, consents, undergoes the verse, and exits transformed. Backstory about the nostalgia ban and the destroyed temples is efficiently woven and directly motivates the present scene. Closure is solidly on-page: Kira cannot return to the provinces and has joined a forbidden lineage, with the final shared dance as a clear “after” state. The main limitation is that no structural complication or reversal interrupts the straight line from request to fulfillment, keeping the arc strong but not maximally dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-moment scene at the bay → stone/ripple divination → realization → new plan, with a clear before/after in her stance. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with patterns of light and water building toward a conceptual repricing of loss and “progress.” Closure lands on the page: she accepts the atrium’s fate and reframes her project as scattered, smaller works, with the demolition as an enduring constraint. Stakes and causality are modest but coherent, and there’s no orientation confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: ascent under pressure, reflective deepening, paralysis at the key action, then a conceptual shift that enables the scattering and the decision to carry the empty box back. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens holds: present stimuli (the path, the box, the crack, the sky) reliably trigger reflections that in turn alter his stance and options. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—he cannot undo loss but chooses a different way to carry it—and the cost (releasing the ashes and relinquishing the fantasy of a “bargain”) is legible. There are no orientation issues or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulative scene in the grotto that tightens from setup (grief, grotto, gauge) to experiment (beads, patterns) to decision (Geneva). Causality is clear under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: her choices with the beads lead to the triangle signal, which leads to the Geneva plan. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she exits with a new course, not certainty. The main limitation is that the decision feels relatively smooth—no on-page complication tests or threatens the emerging choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous exploration that accumulates discoveries (diaries, filaments, recordings) and culminates in a conceptual reconfiguration—Mira recognizing herself as the answer to the walls’ “dream.” Causality is straightforward and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure lands clearly. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but it is present in the idea of legacy as both weight and obligation. No major orientation or causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece functions as a single continuous, accumulative scene: arrival → preparation → painting → departure, with the bells and fading light as a structural frame. Causality is clean—her arrival after rain and before bells directly motivates the act, and the ending’s Charged Poise (the painting waiting, shimmering) lands. Closure is conceptual rather than dramatic, but the before/after (a bare terrace vs. a charged sanctuary-object) is legible with the cost embedded in the borrowed heartbeat. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the celestial alignment as a natural clock, with clear orientation and a coherent causal chain leading to the signing. The closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—peace is not resolved, but Elara’s decision to keep “paying” after this treaty reconfigures the meaning of the moment with visible cost. The ritual and signatures land on-page and the before/after (another failed attempt vs. a potentially tradition-anchored peace) is legible. Escalation is modest, with little risk that the signing itself will fail once both arrive, which slightly softens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense ritual on the lakebed framed by tightly integrated backstory about the drought and her career. Causality is solid—her prior decisions created this exact setting and enable the act of “release,” and the ending reaches an Earned Stasis where she walks away unchanged but clarified. Reflection does a lot of work but remains anchored in concrete cues (salt cracks, thunder, rain), so orientation never blurs. Escalation is quiet and largely emotional, but the storm’s approach and the activation of the device give the piece a clear arc.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: courtyard → ritual → voices → inheritance → new mission, with a clear before/after defined by the unlocking. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration—she moves from solitary anomaly to carrier of a chorus with a concrete future aim. Causality is straightforward and coherent, but the process is almost frictionless, with no real risk that the ritual might fail or harm her. The cost is mainly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized as a constrained choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure—a single continuous scene framed by the aftermath of an argument—holds cleanly, with backstory woven in at natural cues (the case, the stick, the bar circuit). Causality is modest but coherent: Vera’s accusation → their cooling-off → her demand to see his work → his performance → their shared marks on the floor. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they move from opposition to a shared, if tentative, stance encoded in the “listening” character and the question mark. Stakes remain small-scale and relational, but the before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: climb → building the frames → waiting → migration → dismantling, all under a single coherent drive (witnessing the last migration). Causality is tight at this length: her grandmother’s code leads to the knots, which attract/are acknowledged by the butterflies, which then reweight Vera’s grief and purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the migration passes, extinction remains inevitable, but the “interrupted cadence” of that evening permanently redefines what “failure” and “record” mean here. No orientation issues or lens ambiguity; the only thing keeping it below the highest band is the relative simplicity of the turn (no true surprise, more a beautifully executed inevitability).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival with the card, engagement with the rope, progressive return of names, and the culminating song form a coherent causal chain. The sanctum rules and the organ-card logic are taught through action, not exposition, and there’s no orientation debt. Closure lands strongly as a resonant reconfiguration: Elin’s relationship to memory and permanence is clearly different by the end, with the card’s disintegration and the rope’s new pattern as concrete markers. The emotional and conceptual cost—letting go of guilt and the last physical relic—is legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival → discovery of directive and seal → breaking it → revelation of the paths’ nature → reorientation of her stance → emerging into a reweighted world. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/conceptual lens, and the closure—her choice to let the future “choose her”—lands with a clear before/after. The cost is primarily conceptual (relinquishing the illusion of control and any one concrete future), which fits the piece’s scale and mode. The temporal mechanics are hand-wavy but consistent enough that they don’t destabilize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by brief, well-integrated backstory, with a clear progression from hypothesis to test to result to stance. Causality is coherent—her prior work and the polymath’s architecture lead directly to this night and its outcome—and the “invitation” reconfigures her future options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to a long, largely thankless vigil based on this contact. The only limitation is that the path from experiment to success is relatively smooth, with little on-page resistance or complication once the night begins.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is lucid: arrival in the sanctuary → failed attempt to scream → cellular-memory lesson via touch and music box → reweighted view of his lineage → departure with altered intent. Causal links hold under a largely causal/lyric hybrid lens, and closure is clear: a decisive change in stance that plausibly averts future violence, charged by the final image of the broken box. The cost—releasing hatred that has defined him—is present but underexpressed on the page, with minimal sense of what he tangibly loses beyond an abstract identity. No orientation or lens-clarity failures, but escalation feels more like a smooth gradient than a pressured hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single evening’s ritual with integrated backstory and a clear progression from preparation → reconstruction of the sextant → first true sight of the dream-world → refusal/postponement. Causality under a largely accumulative lens is solid: the years of mirror-making justify why the sextant now works, and synchronized breathing leads directly to the glimpse and thus to the choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from “chasing a runaway dream” to understanding it as invitation, with a cost in deferred fulfillment and continued liminality. Stakes remain somewhat quiet and internal, but they cohere and resolve without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: climb → orchard discovery → bag inspection → journal revelation → explicit commitment to teach. Orientation is excellent from the opening lines, and the single continuous scene supports a tight structural arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira reframes the “deciduous vows” and passes the ribbon, accepting a new era at a felt cost. The main limitation is that the story’s central problem (loss of knowledge) is solved somewhat straightforwardly once the journal appears, with little jeopardy after that turn.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: orchard → bathroom → conceptual reveal → acceptance, all under a single coherent lens. Causality is internally logical (the bathroom breakthrough follows from the grandmother’s notes and Maren’s inquiry), and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “inheritance” with a clear cost—responsibility “forever…between the first and last page.” The main weakness is that the nonlinear-inheritance mechanics arrive largely as explanation rather than dramatized pressure, so the pivotal understanding feels a bit told. Still, the before/after is legible and charged, and the final stance is clearly reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: diary → bookstore/mountain → time traveler’s warning → reframed understanding → negotiation → Thessaly’s return. Closure is solid, with a clear before/after in the mountain’s stance and the possibility of lessons entering the world. However, most of the seventeen days of searching and the danger of the stacks are summarized, leaving the on-page climax—the negotiation—feeling almost too frictionless. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival on the ship → exploration seeded with memory clues → encounter with the sister → choice to reclaim versus accept erasure → partial restoration and departure. Causality holds under a largely situational/causal hybrid lens, and the closure unit (choosing remembrance and physically leaving together) is legible with a before/after. The conceptual cost of leaving the Garden’s “solace” is present but under-dramatized; the decision lands more as poetic logic than as a wrenching trade. Still, for this length the arc is tight, with no major orientation or motivation gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: impossible door → recognition of symbols → inference about Voss → discovery of the Unity Cord → reconfiguration → bell's transformative toll. Structure is tight and single-scene, with a clear before/after once the final braid is placed, yielding a resonant reconfiguration of the tower and of Voss’s "absence." The main shortfall is the lack of significant complication or reversal; everything unfolds with near-frictionless inevitability. Closure still lands clearly, if a bit neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and causal: obsolete maps → descent into altered caves → reading the ice → discovery of the hush chamber → decision to map it for others. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she “plants herself” in the eye of the storm and commits to a new mapping purpose, with the before/after legible. The drive lens remains consistent and orientation is never in doubt. Cost is present but underplayed—her de facto exile from the sounding world and profession is implied more than dramatized, keeping this just under the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the prism → amplified vision in the pavilion → revelation of the alignment and date → sprint to rekindle the beacon as the stars shift, producing a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s role expands from mere custodian to keeper of a new dawn, with the rekindled beacon under the aligned stars as the hinge. The structure (present action framed around a single night with integrated flashback-visions) is straightforward and legible. The main limitation is that the “cost” of neglecting the beacon never bites—nothing truly goes wrong before she fixes it—so narrative tension stays slightly safer than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: ascent to observatory, experimental conjecture via shadows, revelation about the nature of collective memory, and a resolved decision to share her findings. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the gradual layering of methods (crystal forecourt, shadow dial, summer-quill pages) coheres into a Conceptual Repricing at the end with a legible before/after. Causality is intact—contradictory monuments lead to a crisis of epistemology, which prompts her new stance. The main limitation is that obstacles remain internal and somewhat low-friction, so the escalation of pressure feels more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: journey → fortress → mosaic message → tower/grandmother → collaborative display → renewed commitment, with no orientation or logic breaks. The mosaic note functions as a clear inciting complication, and the fireworks sequence is a coherent payoff under a primarily causal lens, with accumulative textural reinforcement. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s relationship to grief and to the knot is reweighted, and the “before/after” is legible. The cost is subtle (choosing ongoing, effortful engagement with pain) rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just shy of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure with causal linking: Elena’s question → Mira’s deflection via the cicada and her work → admission of failure → Elena’s tentative invitation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (a charged poise beginning their “slow work of emergence”) with a clear before/after in their relationship. The cost—years of absence and the father’s death—is felt, though the actual present-tense decision is gentle rather than sharply turned. Within a situational/accumulative lens, the progression is coherent and satisfying, if not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: an hour-long gravity inversion creates a contained window for a single experience that culminates in a new internal stance. Causality is modest but coherent—she times her visit, the inversion happens, she undergoes a charged sensory/emotional sequence, and emerges with a clarified next step. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but the before/after (timid, unsteady vs steady legs and a chosen delay on the bunker silence) reads clearly. Stakes remain mostly interior and low-intensity, which limits the felt cost of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present-time scene anchored by a few well-placed backstory strokes, with a clear progression from approach → pattern in the vial → decision → changed terrace. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: because she’s monitored this crossing and sees an unprecedented helix, therefore she chooses to open the vial, therefore the terrace’s silence reconfigures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost, as she gives up Mira’s preserved “atmospheric memory” to alter the terrace’s function. The only limitation is relatively low overt resistance; nothing in the world pushes back against her goal beyond her own implied reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: legends lead to the waterfall, to the orchard, to the murals, to the central tree, to the stairway and decision to ascend. The structure holds as a single, continuous quest with one dominant drive and a clear before/after: an unclaimed throne vs. a path now actively taken. Closure is solidly on the page with cost implied in her irreversible step away from her prior life and into a century-gated test. The main limitation is that each obstacle yields fairly smoothly, so while causality is intact, the turns feel controlled rather than truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: fading threshold → Sera’s approach → plea → conditional offer → acceptance and teaching, culminating in the reconfigured threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira allows a temporary breach and the sanctuary itself subtly changes (“thinner now, more permeable”) with clear emotional cost. The piece holds a consistent situational/accumulative drive lens—pressure stems from the situation and is deepened via imagery and micro-choices rather than big reversals. Structure is tight and single-scene; no orientation or causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: thinning → messages → doorway → volunteer choice → overwhelming pressure → diamond outcome, all in one coherent scene. Closure is clear and on-page: Vera transforms the “quantum promise” into proof and commits to continued volunteering, with psychological cost paid in facing her trauma. The structure is tight but slightly risk-free; nothing meaningfully threatens to derail the process once she decides, which keeps the arc from feeling fully knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulative scene in the reading room that builds from tactile action (winding the gramophone) to visionary revelation and then to a quiet stance shift. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her musing and use of the gramophone “therefore” invites the standing-wave revelation, which reconfigures her understanding of the family and her own path. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes the dynasty’s end as moral repair and chooses to take up the method. The cost is conceptual and emotional more than dramatized, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single accumulating scene: arrival in the greenhouse, discovery of the program, recognition of patterns, surrender of armor, and apotheosis-like connection. Causality is coherent—each step (“seeing symbols” → “speaking allegiance” → “threads weaving” → “sky healing”) follows a because/therefore texture, even inside a lyric frame. Closure lands with a clear before/after—withdrawn knight vs. vessel of possibility and the first star reappearing—with a conceptual and emotional cost. Stakes skew abstract (identity and metaphysical role) and could feel sharper if even one concrete consequence or lost alternative path were highlighted.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one present-tense scene framed by a continuous activity (archival work) with neatly interleaved historical exposition. The discovery of the 1867 file and button functions as the central beat that reconfigures Eleanor’s stance and solidifies closure as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Causality is accumulative rather than event-driven but coherent, and the final choice to keep returning to the archive lands with clear cost and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the Council’s impending raid compresses Mira’s long-term plan into hours, leading to the lagoon, the Vault, the upload, and the escape, culminating in the public leak. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph and the drive lens remains clearly causal through to closure. However, several key beats (the upload under threat, the decoy explosion, the escape) are skimmed in summary, reducing felt consequence and making the resolution slightly convenient. The closure—a conceptual and situational reconfiguration where truth irreversibly leaks—is legible and satisfying but not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by crucial backstory that directly informs the present attempt to break the prophecy. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: years of practice → invocation of the vested hush → shattering of the prophecy → new status quo. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in her mental state and future options. The only missed opportunity is a slightly too-smooth success without a concrete on-page risk of failure or near-miss to tighten the climax further.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is tight and legible: quiet setup of routine, explanation of the hush window, then the inciting anomaly (today feeling different) leading directly to the leaf-invitation and Wren’s transformation. The causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens is clean—her long, ritualized method builds to the pivotal prod of the crimson leaf. Closure is strong: she emerges altered, reinterpreting seeds and leaves, and the final monument concretizes the before/after shift. The main limitation is that the transformation costs her very little on the page, so the decisive change carries more conceptual than felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the dead client → map beneath the ashes → subterranean journey → greenhouse → compass and logbook → new decision about timekeeping, all under a single coherent drive. The “when coincidence becomes pattern” beat effectively justifies her acceptance that someone wants her here, tightening the situation and leading credibly to the retrieval of the compass and log. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of time and instruments, with a clear before/after in her stance and a modest but legible cost (abandoning the security of precision). The only ceiling is that external stakes remain very low; nothing in the world really pushes back beyond the mystery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: she waits out the search party, chooses to act alone in the foundry, conducts the experiment, and arrives at a new understanding. The single-scene structure with interleaved backstory is coherent and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of redemption and legacy. What holds it out of higher range is the lack of any significant complication or setback in the experiment itself, so escalation feels more assumed than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: descent into Echo Gorge → encounter with harp → revelation via spectral confessions → ascent with restored purpose. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: touching the misaligned harp summons the spirits and their confessions, which in turn force a reevaluation of Maren’s life’s work. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: her understanding of “collection” and “healing” is reweighted with emotional cost on the page. The single scene keeps orientation and stakes clear, without unkept setups or temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: interrogation → enhancement → escape during penance → perception of the algorithm → decision to rewrite it. The story fits an accumulative/textural lens but still delivers a clear closure beat when she buries the strap and commits to staying in the forest, a Decisive Change/Charged Poise hybrid with conceptual cost. Stakes and time are legible (three days of penance, three hours post-anesthesia), and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues. The main limitation is that most key turns are realized through reflection rather than dramatized interaction, which flattens some structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival at the market → targeted search → recognition of the painting’s hidden layers → discovery and claiming of the fragment → vision of the true city. Closure is strong, with a decisive change (she accepts the fragment and her role) and a clear before/after in what she and we can see. The cost—committing her life to the between-spaces—is legible but could be sharpened with one more concrete on-page consequence or sacrificed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: job → odd dust/light behavior → ghost → hidden mainspring → ethical choice → resolution. Orientation is excellent; we know who, where, and why almost immediately. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Miriam reframes her task from mechanical salvage to rescuing Eleanor’s legacy, with a clear before/after in her stance. The main limitation is that the core conflict resolves smoothly, without much structural complication or competing options to tighten the screws.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: frost omen → preparation of press and whisper → external tremors → lever pull → systemic transformation and descent. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens, and the closure is decisive: the library shatters its own stasis and commits to re-entering the world at a visible cost. The press’s destruction and the library’s descent provide a clear before/after and earned feeling of completion. A minor limitation is the absence of real obstacles or reversals; it’s a straight progression rather than a pressured struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-moment storm and mirror ritual anchored by backstory about the failed revolution and the archaeological dispute, all driving toward the decisive act of crossing. Causality is intact—storm and shard prompt theory, theory reinterprets architecture, that reinterpretation reframes the shard as key and motivates the mirror crossing. The academic-consortium dispute is more frame than engine and doesn’t meaningfully affect the climax, but it doesn’t break coherence. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change with cost (leaving her life and body of work for an unknown temporal existence).

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: note and stone → setup in chamber → progressive activation of boxes → dishonest motive exposed → corrected intention → successful tethering and dispersal. Structure is a single, focused ritual scene with one key internal turn and a clear before/after in both the stone and Elias. Closure is solid—light redistributed, stone gone, Elias changed—though the midnight deadline stays more conceptual than actively dramatized. Nothing crucial is left dangling or patched retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal-with-accumulative texture: descent → lagoon → psychometry → vision of Vennard → lagoon responding → Threshold realization → choice to remain. The central drive (find the Threshold/where explanations fail) is present from the compass and psychometry onward and pays off in the spinning needle and “welcome” message. Closure is strong—a resonant reconfiguration where “lost” vs. “home” is explicitly reweighted with conceptual and emotional cost. The plot is more contemplative than pressurized, but there are no causality gaps or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: stranded in storm → shelter under archway → using the slide → layered revelations → post-storm resolution, with clear causal links (storm kills GPS, forcing reliance on the slide, which reveals the alliance). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Marina redefines her life’s work and future path based on new knowledge. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, with causal underpinnings, and it holds steady to the end. Stakes remain mostly existential and aesthetic rather than sharply pressured, which keeps the change meaningful but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: postcards → glass layers → realization → mural → visitors, with time’s passage woven smoothly through seasonal and diurnal shifts. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence, and the etched-glass sequence provides a lucid through-line. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: night-blooming as devotion to the overlooked, reweighting both the grandmother’s life and Mira’s work. The cost (loneliness, sleeplessness, quiet devotion) is implied rather than dramatized, but it’s legible and coherent under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: encrypted diary → visions → coordinates → zeppelin detour → meeting → testimony recorded. Structure is linear with one large backstory block that remains anchored and pays off at the lagoon. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Celeste’s role shifts from passive archivist to active bridge, with the testimony as a concrete outcome. The main limitation is that the story’s turns are mostly informational rather than confrontational, so the decisive moment feels quiet rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: last wish → village empties → Mira arrives with bottle → communion → reinterpretation of the wish → lantern solution → return of villagers. Structure is tight for the length, with a legible before/after and a strong final image; closure lands as a conceptual repricing of what “sustains” a community. The cost is largely retrospective and conceptual (her exile, the village’s dependency), but it’s clearly present at the ending. Escalation is more intellectual than peril-driven, yet remains coherent under a causal/thematic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: we move from setup (silence, tower, profession) through activation of the wax shaving to the discovery of accidental prophecy and a redefinition of her role. Causality holds and the backstory (the museum trip) is well anchored and clearly shifts how we read her present gift. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: she realizes her life’s work has been preparation for this destined moment and enters a charged new stasis as the “living promise.” The main limitation is that the narrative drive is largely accumulative and reflective rather than sharply pressured, so the sense of “before/after” is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear orientation (who/where/when) almost immediately, and a coherent progression from approach → method → contact → integration → new status. Causality is sound (journals → entropy trick → humming → organized ice → vortex contact → understanding), and the closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration where her role and the nature of “borrowed time” are reweighted. However, the promised risk of “dissolution” never materially constrains tactics or produces a visible price; the scene unfolds with very little genuine jeopardy. That keeps the ending from feeling as hard-won as the conceptual stakes suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: past siren work → observant sanctuary routine → solstice equilibrium → note about the rope → zero hour → bell. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: warning reframed as acknowledgment, with a before/after in what “sound” means to her life’s work. Stakes and cost remain mostly conceptual and serene, so the climax lacks any real sense that another outcome was viable, which keeps it shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nightly routine → lantern interlude → deepened realization → dawn, with no orientation or causality slips. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing where Mira’s refusal to leave and her reframing of “falling” as “flying” mark a clear before/after in how her solitude is valued. Cost is legible in the acceptance of permanent smallness and isolation, even if external stakes remain quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-time encounter with one ghost framed by succinct backstory about the covenant and world change. Causality within the quiet, accumulative lens is solid: the visible ghosts lead to the grandmother’s appearance, which leads to the covenant, which leads to Maren’s ongoing role and the specific mother-ghost vignette. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Maren reaffirming her role while contemplating a possible future journey—with the cost residing in her continued waiting and isolation. Stakes remain modest and there is only one major on-page instance of her work, which slightly limits structural intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: urn fragment → capsule response → discovery of listings → realization of Elena’s method → Vera’s decision and resealing. The drive is primarily accumulative/textural, yet the sequence of discoveries narrows Vera’s options in a logical way toward the closing stance. Closure is solid—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera redefines her borrowed time as a vocation—but the stakes stay mostly conceptual, with the cost of those years implied rather than felt. The Numerical Reformation backstory is well integrated and doesn’t derail the central throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: rain’s aftermath → discovery of feather → kite mishap → repair and reconfiguration → reflective closure. The story lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira’s woven-dawns philosophy is reweighted by the act of mending the kite and accepting her smudged words as part of the pattern. There are no orientation issues or causality breaks, and the single-scene arc is well-contained. The cost and stakes remain modest, so the closure is satisfying but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: diagnosis → return → experimental bridge-work → community uptake → final entry and walk, with strong causal continuity under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure—Maren stepping into the orchard, being welcomed into the slow conversation—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after and the cost of her imminent death. Time progression (weeks on first junction, four months later, then the final weeks) is legible and supports the six-month frame. There are no major unkept set-ups or causality breaks, though obstacles remain gentle rather than sharply testing her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival at the tower → observation of the object and others → realization of the aliens’ intent → decision to respond. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with the amber and the pilgrims’ silence steadily reweighting the situation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Mira reframes “homecoming” and commits to conveying understanding, with a clear before/after stance. Stakes remain largely internal and contemplative, so the structural turn feels more intellectual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at jetty → framing backstory → explanation of reef/bird/seeds system → execution of tonight’s seeding → reaffirmed commitment at closure. Causality is solid within a lyric mode—reef death changes chemistry, which enables the flowers and tactics, which in turn underwrite his gardening ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the world and reef’s “generous decay” are reweighted in the final image, with a clear before/after in his chosen vocation. The one limitation is that the narrative holds a single pressure band throughout, so structural tightening is more implied than felt as a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal: Archive discovery → riddle → compost pit search → box/leaf/map → decision to leave. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph; the drive lens remains causal throughout. Closure lands via a decisive change (Marta choosing to follow the living) with a legible cost implied in her age, danger, and leaving home, though the danger remains mostly conceptual rather than acutely dramatized. The only ceiling on this score is that the path from clue to clue is relatively smooth, with little structural complication or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: present-tense anniversary frame, interleaved backstory, then the pressure point of the approaching ship leading to a clear stance at the end. Causality is straightforward and legible, and the temporal anomaly rules are consistent enough for the length. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to her chosen role with visible opportunity cost. The main limitation is that the narrative remains largely contemplative; the ship’s arrival tightens things but doesn’t radically reconfigure options beyond reaffirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal: sky-wrong → opportunity → sundial lid → chess-vault puzzle → letter twist → new role, with no orientation issues. Closure is strong: the letter and Corwin’s descent with the draught mark a decisive before/after in knowledge and status, with legible emotional cost. However, the central obstacle (the vault puzzle) resolves on the first pass without real setback or complication, making escalation feel somewhat easy. The sky-wrong time limit is explained but doesn’t bite on the page as acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: gallery walks → backstory of the camps and drills → chessboard revelation → decision → restoration of pawns. Causality is emotionally clear (her history leads to this particular act of memorial and renunciation), and the closure—leaving the gallery after restoring the pawns, with “remember” spelled in her steps—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently. Slightly heavy exposition about her job in the middle saps a bit of momentum but doesn’t break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the stone, repeated failed seeding, introduction of the feather, embodied-learning breakthrough, then final ascent. Causality is strong—each new element (stone, forgetting mechanism, feather, inscriptions) directly alters Vera’s options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reclaims her talent and chooses to bear the world’s grief, with a charged final image of ascent toward the listening sky. The only limit is that the repeated-night pattern is summarized rather than partially dramatized, which slightly mutes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → decoding the tapestry → tracing the labyrinth → mirror realization → releasing the knight → time resuming. Closure is solid, with both a decisive change (time restarting) and a conceptual repricing (his guilt reinterpreted), and the cost—relinquishing a defining self-condemnation—is legible. Structure is straightforward single-scene with embedded backstory, all clearly oriented. The only limiter is that the solution unfolds with little real resistance or complication, producing a slightly “smooth” resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: childhood memory → summons → preparation → ritual → result, with strong causal links and a clear before/after in how the towers function. The closure is a conceptual repricing—Absolution becomes preservation of complexity—and it lands on the page as the towers hum and her mother “remains, in all her truths.” The only thing keeping this short of top-tier is that external consequences (Elders’ retaliation, broader societal cost) remain abstract, so the felt price at closure is more conceptual than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene that escalates from contemplation to ritual to transformative climax. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each narrated mark tightens the pattern until the key ring’s transformation and the workshop’s reconfiguration. Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: Vera’s stance toward her past and uncertainty has changed with visible cost. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: mirror crack → decision to leave → wrong turn to cave → intense painting session → realization → return home, with a clear before/after in his stance toward memory and promise. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, with causal links holding throughout (each physical move plausibly leading to the next). Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he returns to the same life but with a reweighted understanding of his long practice and fragmentation. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the emotional cost of continuing under this new, clearer awareness is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: an anchored opening, ascent, encounter, invitation, and descent toward a new stasis with the boy. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the scent leads her to infer a call, the call leads to the boy, the cork-guided intention leads to his acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after—Mira alone with a neglected light vs. Mira with a student and a new kind of tending—is legible. The cost is primarily emotional and past-tense (dead birds, the boy’s loss), so the climax feels more inevitable than pressured, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is crisp: hydraulics fail, others leave, she stays; the midnight calls and censer discovery are cleanly sequenced, and the solstice deadline emerges naturally from the final call. Under a largely accumulative/textural lens, the structure tightens from malfunction → calls → construction → activation → recognition of the caller with a legible conceptual before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from tending a dead infrastructure to actively guiding the “reverse migration” of the lost, with a visible cost in ongoing vigil. The only drag on a higher score is that the future-self phone twist feels lightly under-seeded and somewhat convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: storm/orchard frame → virus/backstory context → inciting incident (relic’s arrival) → experiment with the eye → resolution in her new plan. Causality is tight—each step logically follows from the last, and the test lie is a clear turning point. Closure is strong: she decisively changes her stance from pure retreat to dangerous engagement, with the execution risk and moral complexity implicit. External antagonism (“they’re looking”) remains offstage, so the sense of immediate external pressure is more implied than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene framed by the dock and lighthouse with a clear causal chain (logbook → pattern of gaps → memory → inscription → decision to contact the woman). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias gains a new role and future intention, and the dock’s meaning is revised. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and it holds. The main limitation is that the investigation proceeds smoothly with little resistance, so the central turn feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: chip → suspicion → journey → ants → cavern → door → crossroads → annotated map left behind. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with situational pressure from the rising creek, and closure lands via an earned reconfiguration—she chooses to bring knowledge back rather than vanish into possibility, at visible cost to her fantasy of escape. The only structural softness is the coy ellipsis around the choice (“She made her decision”) and the somewhat convenient timing and didacticism of the father’s appearance. Nonetheless, the story delivers a clear before/after in options and understanding without plot holes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: ominous dreams → climb to the grotto → oracle’s accusation → firefly-triggered realization → resolved descent with a plan for proof. The story delivers a clear closure unit in the form of Charged Poise: by the end, the queen’s options and stance are decisively reconfigured, with a visible future cost. The revelation that the dreams are memories retrofits the whole structure without feeling like a cheat. The only mild limitation is that the promised noon “proof” is gestured at rather than concretely defined, though the piece doesn’t require that detail for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene moving from preparation for departure to a charged conversation to an internal reframing and a modest but clear decision. Causality holds—Theo’s confrontation (“I know why you’re really going”) directly drives the thematic and emotional turn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mira keeps her external plan (leaving) but alters the governing premise (from trapping presence to practicing attention) with a visible cost in her separation from Theo. Stakes are largely internal and philosophical, but they are made legible through concrete objects (pocket-sun, shell) and the leaving/return frame.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense handling of the scrolls continually reweighted by backstory, all driving toward a conceptual repricing of chaos vs. narrative. Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) lands early and the nonlinear dream logic is controlled and legible. Closure is strong: the ending locks in a new relationship to her own death and to time, with a felt cost. It could be marginally tighter if one more concrete present-moment obstacle tested her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single causal encounter in the shop that moves from request to diagnosis to repair to emotional handoff. The drive is largely accumulative/textural—each revealed layer of the clamp’s damage and family history deepens the same core stake. Closure is strong via the restored screw, Margaret’s tears, and the invitation to return, which read as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost. The only limitation is that options and consequences are quiet, so the structural turn feels more like deepening than a sharp change.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: setup of the ritual and curse, escalation as the ice resurfaces mid-ceremony, and a climactic experiment that alters her relationship to the ice. Causality is coherent—each step (memory → ice → runes on skin → shedding frost) clearly triggers the next, and the “breath between storms” provides a temporal bracket. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the ice as language and commits to returning to the academy with this new stance. The cost is relatively quiet (no external repercussion yet), keeping this just shy of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear and tight: Marcus comes to apologize and free Eleanor before the orchard is destroyed, deploys an experimental method tied to her unfinished work, and succeeds at a visible cost (lateness, loss of the trees, lingering guilt). Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the piece holds a consistent causal lens. Closure lands cleanly with Eleanor’s release and the charged task to “finish the symphony,” giving a definite before/after. The only limit is that the exorcism unfolds quite smoothly, without any structural complication or setback that might deepen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece reads as accumulative/lyric, with the drive built around her movement through the library and the gradual activation of the scrolls. Causality is coherent: she enters, discovers method, reads, initiates spiral arbitration, and passes through a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the stakes and constraints remain highly abstract, so the closure feels more like a graceful reframing than a pressured, costly turn. Structure is elegant and self-consistent, but the arc is closer to ritual completion than to a hard-earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-time station work → discovery/use of key and journal → experiment with counting backwards → threshold opening and crossing, with a clear before/after. Causality holds under a largely accumulative/textural lens: observations and hints accrue until the counting ritual triggers a literalized conceptual shift. Closure is strong—Einar exits his world, leaving the station and key behind—but the personal and practical costs of that departure are more implied than dramatized. Still, the arc feels complete and proportionate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is tight: present-tense exploration braided with backstory, all funneled toward the final reconfiguration of what “letting go” means. Causality is coherent—her reading of the mushrooms leads to reading the farm as a map, which leads to the decision to contact the partner and re-engage with David’s life. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: she doesn’t “move on” so much as accept a new state where presence and absence co-exist, and the cost (belated reconnection, openly weeping) is felt. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable; you could push further by giving one concrete, on-page obstacle to her intention in the present so the shift has a slightly sharper hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: present in the library framed by well-anchored backstory and the subway investigation, all leading causally to the archive folder and final decision. The “Green Line / Seat 14 / coordinates → library” chain is clear and satisfying without overcomplication. Closure lands as a conceptual and emotional turn (her reframing of her father’s legacy and her own path) with a visible future-cost in paying the debt and pursuing difficult research. The piece leans heavily on reflection, but it stays anchored in the present and doesn’t blur orientation or the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: an opening establishing Vera’s role and setting, a central beat with the grieving mother, then a short closing beat that reaffirms and slightly reframes Vera’s ongoing task. Causality is simple but coherent—wrong-number calls arrive at liminal times, Vera intervenes, the mother’s next-step action (baby photos) follows from Vera’s guidance. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: “teach endings how to begin” is enacted by redirecting the grief loop outward while Vera accepts her static role. Stakes remain intimate but clear, with no major gaps or confusing ellipses.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line is clean: discovery of the letters → meeting the Keeper at the prescribed time/place → decision to renew the covenant → return to the archive with reconfigured purpose. Closure is solidly on-page as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts the role and recommits to her work under a new meaning-framework. The main cost—her life quietly bound to this duty—is implied rather than dramatized, so consequences feel conceptually clear but not sharply felt. Structure is otherwise tight and appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Yuen’s charge → months of rumor-hunting → arrival at the station → revelation of the protocol → Maya’s decision to join. The piece maintains clear orientation in time and space and fits a single-scene-with-flashback frame. Closure lands as a decisive change (Maya committing to help distribute the compound / stop running) with a resonant final image that reweights earlier details (ivy, foxes, reciprocity). If anything, the “15 years of favors” backstory is heavy for the length but doesn’t break logic or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: commission and setup → journey into the forest → encounter with the stillpoint → mapping → choice not to return. Orientation is solid early, and the emotional and worldbuilding rules remain consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she discovers the stillpoint is a doorway and decides to turn away—with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that some middle beats (“Meridia had waited three years...”) compress potential on-page testing of that setup.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong: past misinterpretation → exile to anomaly → new, temporally scrambled Kepler signal → chance to revise the original message. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what this anomaly is), and the single-scene structure with interleaved backstory fits the length and drive. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she sends a corrective message and reinterprets her relationship to guilt and history, with the cost of enduring uncertainty. The only limit is that the paradox mechanics stay mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete obstacles or consequences in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous nocturnal encounter, a clear setup (threat to harbor), and a closure beat where Elena departs armed with new understanding while Mira reframes herself from unseen witness to catalytic seer. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images of silence rather than plot complications—and that through-line holds. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive act; the before/after of Elena’s stance is legible and the cost (risk of loss, Mira’s continued marginality) is present if subtle. The vote itself is off-page, so the story leans heavily on conceptual rather than event-level payoff, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong and legible: library demolition → arson → going off-grid → descent into archive → progressive discovery → letter → reconfiguration of self-understanding. The structure (one present-tense descent braided with concise backstory) is clean and supports a clear before/after at the end. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: Miriam’s vanished, guilty status is reweighted into “found” heir with a new obligation, with visible emotional cost. Stakes are mostly internal/identity-based, but they resolve coherently under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: present-tense walk to the sculpture, backstory woven in, the drumming ritual, then release and aftermath, all under one scene-lens. Causality is coherent (she enters after hours → drums → garden responds → Elias separates), and the closure beat—being alone again but recontextualized—is legible with cost. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with the ritual performance escalating pressure toward the resonance event. Stakes are modestly scaled but consistent; a slightly sharper on-page sense of what she risks vis-à-vis the protocols would strengthen the structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: unknown footsteps → confrontation → key-as-template insight → guided traversal → discovery of the container. Structure holds as a single coherent scene with one clear tightening when Celia decodes the key’s function and commits to leading him. Closure lands as a successful retrieval plus a conceptual reweighting of secrecy/whispers, though the cost is mostly emotional and thematic rather than sharply dramatized. Nothing important is left dangling, but the stakes never quite feel pressured enough to break into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in the dock, with backstory used to charge the present rather than derail it. Causality is straightforward: she sees the boy in danger, chooses a nonverbal method, escalates the light patterns, and he leaves—the closure reads as a small but real reconfiguration. The dominant drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the pattern of light builds toward a charged final vigil image with a legible before/after in stakes. Cost is gentle but present in her ongoing endurance and acceptance that some secrets remain half-spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous preparatory scene in the grotto framed by arrival/departure, with backstory anchored to concrete present tasks. Causality is coherent (disillusionment → organizing the rebellion → leaving the chess set and walking into the mist) and the closure functions as a Charged Poise moment. However, the scene largely summarizes a plan already chosen rather than staging a decisive new turn under pressure. The cost and change at the end are more conceptual than dramatized, which slightly blunts structural impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain (Treaty → transformation → map activation → whale call → dive → island) is clean and legible, and the story uses one continuous scene with brief, purposeful backstory. Closure lands clearly: Mira chooses the island and forecloses her surface life with an on-page goodbye. The cost is emotional and situational rather than plot-twist-driven, which fits the length but keeps the climax relatively smooth and predictable. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a situational accent and holds coherently to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: dishwashing → whittling → drone pass → tally of figures → final kitchen moment, each beat deepening our sense of her covert mourning practice. Causality is modest but coherent: the Mandate and its surveillance shape her tactics, and her rituals accrue into a clear, earned closing stance (continuing secret grief as rebellion). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—“remade hush” and “almost smiled” reweight all prior mundanity—rather than a decisive event. The piece deliberately forgoes a sharper inciting incident or turning point, which keeps it from the highest structural bands but suits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear before/after—Mora arrives in doubt, leaves in conviction as the atrium and lake respond. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent: touch → hum → paraphrasing → glow → crack in lake → moths, with the Council’s trembling certainty as conceptual closure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, but the sense of the sacred being redefined is legible and satisfying for this length. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps it just shy of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain (seeking Theo → presenting loss and sacrifice → ritual → awakening) is clean, with no orientation issues or broken logic. The global drive is Causal with some textural accumulation, and closure is a clear Decisive Change: she gains color vision at the cost of her grief-object and familiar darkness. Stakes and price are legible on the page, but the negotiation phase feels low-friction; Theo’s warning doesn’t seriously endanger the outcome. Structure is tight for the length but lacks a genuinely testing turn before assent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is very coherent: the “stations” of recordings function as sequential beats that each reframe Mira’s understanding, leading to a clear conceptual shift. Causality within this mode is strong—each recording plausibly triggers a new question or realization, and the blackout/power-grid frame cleanly brackets the story. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she returns to the bells with a new stance and concrete altered practice (ringing as unrequited reaching). Stakes remain internal and philosophical, but the cost—accepting connection without reciprocity—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: rock bottom → retreat to observatory → discovery of stencil → origami outreach → emergent community → renewed vocation and stance. Causality is coherent and accumulative rather than twist-driven, with the observatory and stencil naturally motivating the crane method and the gathering of mourners. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s understanding of the stencil as blueprint and her choice to meet a new mourner crystallize a before/after with the ongoing cost of grief intact. The piece leans on summary for some middle beats, which slightly softens the sense of lived turns, but the global arc remains strong and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece tracks cleanly as a single scene with causal beats (Marcus arrives because of the crash; the reading unfolds; her explanation reframes his visit) and a clear closure unit when he asks about giving up control and selects the Moon. The drive lens reads as mostly accumulative/textural with situational pressure, and the final image offers a modest conceptual repricing of what readings mean. Still, escalation is gentle and the cost at closure is more implied than felt, so structurally it’s solid but not quite at top-tier urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: decades-long search → discovery of archive → understanding prior failure → decision to attempt purification → transformed understanding at the end. Backstory about the Netharans and the Purging Wars is well-timed and always re-anchors into the present choice. Closure is strong: she completes the ritual, accepts the cost of irreversible transformation, and leaves as a different person while the archive collapses. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and that lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: past noticing → comparison of old/new footage → realization about the shadow → confrontation and offering → metamorphosis and reconfigured status quo. Causality is tight and legible; each step follows from Vera’s prior observations and role. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change/RR: the shadow’s function in the library is redefined and Vera’s understanding of grief shifts, with a felt conceptual cost in what can’t be restored. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative with a causal spine, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single night of work framed by the morning revelation and closing on a new resolve at dawn. Causal links are coherent (discovery of the con → crisis of purpose → physical reconstruction → decision to act and reframe meaning), with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Reflection is well anchored in present stimuli (mist, vial, enclosure) and doesn’t break orientation or lens; the accumulative build feels controlled, if somewhat low on surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: failed surgery → renewed plant voices → realization about mother’s message → urgency before doctors arrive → decision to escape, punctuated by the hourglass activating. Structure is linear and well-contained in a single scene with backstory anchored to present objects (desk, rings, hourglass). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/incipient Decisive Change: they commit to the journey and reality appears to answer via the falling sand. The only limitation is that the external escape remains just-begun rather than tested on the page, keeping the arc modest in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a present-time visit to the booth, a psychometric descent into memory/psychic space, and a return that yields a reconfigured stance toward the letters. Causality under an accumulative lens is solid—each step follows from the last, and the final act of loading the strip into the projector is a coherent response to what she’s discovered. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the problem shifts from “retrieving unused love” to “planting it,” with a tangible ritual act. The arc is modest but fully legible with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: village’s creative sterility → Elara’s gift reveals the lack → mountain ascent → discovery of the instrument → understanding → release → village reawakens → Elara’s rest and descent. Orientation and world rules are clear early, and the structure holds a single dominant drive with a solid on-page closure (the valley’s transformation and Elara’s changed inner noise). The closure has conceptual and emotional cost but could be deepened by foregrounding what Elara risks (or might lose) if she fails or if release goes wrong. Nonetheless, the piece delivers a complete, legible arc under a mainly causal lens with lyric inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: walk → anomaly → intervention → reconfigured understanding, all in one continuous scene with legible stakes and a clear before/after. Causality within the speculative frame is coherent—the divergent archive explains the child’s presence and Mira’s ability to act, and the dune’s dimming provides on-page cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s stance toward hope is subtly altered and the path is “remembered” by the archive. Escalation is modest and mostly conceptual, but not confused or undercut.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: we open in a new grove, establish the condition and method, discover the failing sequoia, and resolve with an on-page attempt and result. Causality is tight under a mostly accumulative lens: listening to the hum leads her to the tree, her past (gear) enables a risky intervention, and the tree’s song reconfigures her understanding. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration—she both saves the tree and deepens her stance on straying. A modest exposition block about the Awakening slows momentum slightly but doesn’t harm coherence or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—walking the ridgeway while encountering embodiments of “roads not taken”—is coherent and easy to follow, with a clean progression from arrival to revelation to reclamation. Causality is simple but intact: her widowhood leads her to the ridgeway, the guides explain the rules, and the walk through regrets culminates in the shore of unused courage. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rule (“courage waits”) is reweighted when she actively claims it and chooses to continue. The main limitation is that the “vigil” frame at the start and end is more conceptual than structurally pressured on Mira herself.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival → eerie warning (“REMAIN”) → discovery of the bolt → revelation of the mechanism → choice at the piano. Causality holds under a situational/causal blend, and the closure unit—a decisive change as she begins turning the bolt—lands with clear before/after implications. The fortress’s rules (voices powering protection, thought-crime against silence) are mostly embedded smoothly, though her quick inference from “bolt” to “mechanism” leans a bit on intuitive leap rather than dramatized deduction. Overall, the arc is tight and legible within the length.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: cryptic notes → recognition via ink → signaling rune → descent and discovery → compilation and strategic placement of evidence. The structure is linear and legible, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the dynasty’s fate is altered through documentation. Still, escalation is conceptual rather than dramatized; there’s no on-page obstacle to research or delivery, so pressure never tightens in a concrete way. The ending cadence works, but the path there feels a touch too frictionless for top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-moment assembling → interleaved discovery of the journals → conceptual click about the dumping → concrete action of transmitting data. Causality under the accumulative lens holds: each revealed layer of backstory reweights Marina’s understanding and options, culminating in a clear closure move with cost. Some of the crucial investigative work is summarized rather than dramatized (e.g., the three months with the journals), but it’s efficient enough that it doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: present-tense ritual in the bay, deepening via the stone circle’s hum, then a reoriented decision toward future action. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens—the hum prompts visions which reframe the lull as breath, leading to her decision to go to the camps. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in her stance toward the rebellion. The main limitation is that external stakes (what concretely changes for the rebellion) are gestured at rather than pressured on the page, keeping the turn largely internal and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: chemical attack → telepathy → whispers about the hidden embryo → kite decoding → song → glass shattering → retrieval and future plan. Orientation is excellent and the story delivers a clear closure (a decisive recovery of the seed and a plan that reconfigures the valley’s future). That said, the path from deciphering the kite to successful unsealing is almost frictionless—no failed attempts or real complications once the method is discovered—so the structural arc feels a touch too easy for top-tier tension. The cost is mostly historical and thematic rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: one anchored present-day morning in the arboretum, with a single, legible backstory shard (the wedding strike) that directly charges the on-page panic episode and her coping choices. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from ghostly remnants to hawk-triggered freeze to the final stance of contained stillness. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to inhabiting the present with cost fully acknowledged. It’s excellent but not quite transcendent in structural daring or complexity, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: single setting, single continuous session in the library, and a clean accumulative build from exploration → recognition of the problem → experiment → conceptual resolution. Causality holds (letter → lighthouse → box → thread → new method), and the closure—leaving with a redefined practice and an altered relationship to truth—lands as a clear conceptual repricing. Cost is present but mostly implied (returning to a world that may not understand); it could be made more viscerally felt. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece maintains a clean single-scene structure with a brief, well-anchored backstory interleaving, and it’s always clear who, where, and when we are. Causality is coherent: arrival → investigation of ink → induced time-slow → revelation of ink’s properties → decision to seek the nomads. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and slight Resonant Reconfiguration: she moves from passive sufferer of time distortion to active hunter of its mechanism, at some personal cost. The explanation of the ink’s function borders on expository but doesn’t break the causal chain or undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: discovery of the letter → secret repair of the network → present-tense decision → Vance’s arrival → upload, with no real logic gaps. Single-scene structure with interwoven backstory is clean and easy to track, and closure is decisive (the upload) with a clear before/after in the world. The main structural limitation is that the antagonist’s late, brief intervention doesn’t seriously threaten the outcome, softening the sense of hard-earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous scene anchored by the tower’s recent fall, with backstory woven in via concrete triggers (insignia under her knees, the sandbag scrap). Causality is straightforward and coherent: tower falls → refugees scatter → soldier arrives at the dome, testing Mira’s stance. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she recommits to tending and “hunting” hope with the soldier sleeping among the roses. The main limitation is that the external event sequence is simple, so the arc leans heavily on reflection rather than on structural surprise or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Unraveling → entry into garden → encounter with Vela → demand to “voice silence” → receipt of the echo → reoriented life. Closure is decisive and on-page, with the echo and her reconfigured relationship to water and guilt marking a clear before/after. The structure is a single, focused quest scene with no orientation debt and one meaningful tightening at the goddess’s condition. The piece could perhaps sustain one additional complication without bloating, but it doesn’t feel thin at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: the journalist’s call → observatory visit → examination of notes → discovery of the near-miss → decision about what to tell. The drive lens is clearly causal, and closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise when she chooses a middle path and begins writing. The ticking date—tomorrow—concentrates structure into a single pressured window. The only limitation is that the asteroid’s safe passage is verified before the final beat, slightly softening late-scene tension even as it strengthens conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: discovery of letters and amber → understanding of their function → deliberate use during the time fold to send the apology backward → internal resolution. Causality under a largely accumulative lens holds; each new revelation about the amber and sounds directly motivates the next action. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the “dawn that tasted…like forgiveness” marks a clear before/after with conceptual and emotional cost. The only limit is that the ritual itself proceeds very smoothly, with little on-page resistance or complication once the premise is in place.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that tightens from arrival in the grotto to the mandala’s activation and the conceptual re-framing of the hush. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent—each concrete act (drawing, placing the tile, listening) deepens the situation rather than resetting it. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing: silence redefined as invitation, with a modest behavioral shift (she begins drawing on the walls) to embody it. Stakes remain somewhat abstract and philosophical, which limits the felt cost despite the elegant arc.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present-time action (cross plaza, touch stone, retrieve memory, carve name) punctuated by well-anchored vision-shards, all under a coherent causal/accumulative lens. Each vision directly informs the next choice, and the causal chain from Emre’s mercy to future resistance leaders is clear. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the act of renaming reweights the plaza, the regime’s erasures, and Kira’s mission at once. The only slight limitation is that external counter-pressure never materializes in-scene, so the structural tension depends almost entirely on memory and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—Madeline weaving timelines into an emotional crescendo—is coherent and pays off in the present woman’s subtle shift away from despair. Causality within the fantastical rules (“fractured timeline,” “producing echoes”) is internally consistent, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Madeline reframes encores as ongoing acts of quiet salvation. The dominant drive (to help someone at a crossroads) stays stable, with the orchard and echoes serving that arc. The cost is somewhat soft-focused; Madeline’s eternity and unfulfilled desire are implied more than foregrounded at the end, blunting maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: static shock → altered pill effect → somatic mapping → discovery of hidden compartment → revelation of corporate control → decision to follow Daniel’s pathways. Single-POV, single-scene structure holds, with backstory anchored to concrete present stimuli (wand, geode, recall notice) and no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: she moves from confusion and isolation to informed, dangerous agency, with the pharmaceutical threat and Daniel’s path reframing her future. The main limitation is that the external antagonistic force stays entirely offstage, so consequence is conceptually rather than dramatically priced.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: descent → fossil discovery → emotional spike → bioluminescent beings → first contact → mapped, resonant ending. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each new phenomenon deepens the premise rather than twisting it arbitrarily. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of the world (humans as one epoch among many, the fossil as bridge), but the cost of that knowledge is implied rather than dramatized. There are no serious orientation issues or broken set-ups, just a relative softness of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story is well-structured as a single, continuous descent-discovery-reframe arc, with the buttons and the jar providing clear causal steps toward understanding. Closure is strong: the prophecy is reinterpreted, Marlowe’s mission is redefined, and the before/after is legible with conceptual cost. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative, with causal beats underpinning the pattern of discovery. The only limitation is that the path from first button to full revelation feels almost too smooth, with no real false turn or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: interpreting the snow code leads to the decision to travel, to the sanatorium meeting, to the pivotal choice to take the folder. The structure (brief build at the bluff, compressed journey, confrontation, and exit) fits the length and never loses orientation. Closure is solid: she forecloses the option of walking away from the espionage world again, accepting the cost of carrying dangerous secrets without forgiving Viktor. The only minor limitation is that the implied “watched” threat never concretely complicates events on the page, leaving that setup underused structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous crossing that begins in danger and ends in comparative safety, with the gutters stopping as a clear mid-scene turn. Causality is modest but intact: the river’s condition and his method of reading it shape pacing and tone, her confession responds to the liminal pressure of the crossing, and the needle gift crystallizes their encounter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn, but the before/after is legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: journey → exploration → discovery → conceptual realization → decision to stay, all under a single continuous scene. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each concrete action (walking the hives, using the lantern, touching the disc) deepens knowledge and culminates in a reweighted understanding of “stability.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Serin decides to stay and recasts her lifelong search for center in light of the disc’s constant choosing. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than pressured by time or threat, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene accumulative structure: rose dies → inheritance object recalled → light signaling → brief contact → earned stasis in her role as caretaker. Causality is soft but coherent, with each reflection anchored in present stimuli (the fallen petal, the harbor, the lit window). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration where she reinterprets her grandfather's line and crystallizes her stance toward endings and persistence. Stakes remain small-scale and internal, but they are clear and carried through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: reincarnation memory → reinterpretation of Korvash’s gift → deliberate activation of the stone circle → emergence of the small creatures → new stance and manuscript. The piece runs as a single, coherent scene with integrated backstory; orientation (who/where/when) is early and solid. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: her role and the library’s function are redefined, with the cost of carrying grief while choosing connection. The only limitation is that external risk or resistance never truly threatens her plan, keeping structural pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with one anchored reflective dip (grandmother/prophecy) that clearly tilts the present. The accumulative drive (from observation of still pond and spheres → recognition of what’s been lost → decision to write and release her own secret) builds coherently toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost: she stops being a pure vessel and risks including herself in the current of shared secrets. Causality is simple but unbroken, with no orientation issues or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: signal → divided campus → Mira’s plan → entities’ reaction → partial reprieve, with the countdown to demolition giving solid structural spine. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (the signal corrupted, procession faltering) and a clear ongoing constraint (they’ll return). Some beats—especially the success of her improvised device and the tricksters’ recoil—resolve a bit quickly and smoothly, softening the sense of real risk. Still, for this length, the arc is coherent and satisfying without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: organ → secret passage → lock → archives, all motivated by Helena’s inherited quest. Orientation is strong from the outset—who, where, when, and why are promptly anchored. Closure lands clearly as both a physical achievement (archives opened) and a reconfiguration of her relationship to fear and her grandmother’s legacy. The structure is straightforward but tight, with no major dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single scene in the quarry framed by Clara’s prior investigation and ending with a clear reconfiguration—truth uncovered, legal justice foreclosed, witness as chosen endpoint. Causality is coherent under a Causal/Hybrid lens: her methodical study of photographs and witnesses leads to the realization about Marcus, which reshapes the meaning of the case and the quarry. Closure is solidly on the page with a felt cost (statute of limitations, Marcus’s untouched life, Clara’s limited power). The main weakness is that the crucial investigative turn (unifying cruel smile/kind eyes) is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens the structural “click.”

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: jet stream shift → journals → decoding → conceptual breakthrough → immediate attempt to warn the world. Backstory is well-anchored in present action and doesn’t blur orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira has transformed Elena’s ignored data into an institutional response, with implied future cost. The main structural weakness is how quickly external resistance collapses once Torres sees the evidence, keeping the climax relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: question → confession → gift of glass → disappearance → map → decision to descend to the cabin. The piece maintains a single window of present time framed by brief, anchored backstory and lands a decisive change as Margaret leaves her old life. Cost is mostly conceptual and prospective (risking late-life reinvention) rather than concretely dramatized, so the closure is strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—childhood refuge → teenage enterprise → peak → father’s return → collapse → return to train—tracks cleanly over time and causality. The drive lens reads Hybrid: causal life events with an accumulative return-to-place pattern culminating in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a big plot turn. Closure is solid: the stones shift from warning to welcome, and the bills’ meaning is repriced. Escalation is more emotional than event-driven, but the beats still line up coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense observatory work interwoven with backstory about Marcus and the temple, all driving toward the translation and her decision to share it. Causality is solid under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—telegram → research into variable stars → decoding → conceptual shift and choice to publish. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines the family burden and commits to a different path, with cost tied to acknowledged guilt and responsibility. The main limitation is that the decoding itself is elided (“when she finally translated it”), softening the sense of a concrete hurdle overcome on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: failed trick → missing reflection → long search → flesh-eating seed → path through vortex → frozen confession → completed sentence → restored reflection. Structure stays within one coherent arc, and the closure beat (her declaration of existence and the lake’s quieting) lands with an earned sense of before/after and cost. The three-year price for the seed and the physical trial through the vortex give the resolution weight. The convenient speed with which she locates her own confession among “thousands” is a small plausibility stretch but doesn’t meaningfully harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: premature convergence → influx of scar-marked seekers → planting the clipping → maze regrowth → emergence of the door → decision to go together with Mira as anchor. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: her role redefined from imprisonment to necessary sacrifice, with the group poised at the threshold. Cost is legible but slightly soft—Mira’s inability to cross and what that entails for her is more implied than dramatized. Still, the before/after in options and understanding is clear and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: revelation of the trade → descent → confrontation → explicit terms of sacrifice → acceptance and return. The closure is a decisive change with clear cost: she regains her destiny at the price of lifelong uncertainty and her grandmother’s immediate death. Structure is cleanly single-scene with a small reflective inset that never muddies orientation. A bit more on-page resistance or difficulty around the bargain could have intensified the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: public failure → exile to the quarry job → discovery of the cloth → encounter with Val → reframed understanding of resonance and purpose → choice to descend to the quarry floor. The piece runs as a single continuous scene with integrated backstory and lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure image—walking “toward the pit where stone had been removed to reveal sky”—makes the before/after legible with emotional cost. Structure is tight for the length; no major set-ups are left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Vasil’s death → coordinates → journey to the arbor → tablet and seed → planting → decision to stay and eat the fruit. The piece delivers clear closure through Elena’s decisive commitment to remain and take up the mantle, with a felt cost (her old life) and a reweighted understanding of “transition.” However, the warning about cost and the stakes it implies never fully crystallize into a concrete dilemma; the path to the ending feels relatively unresisted. Within a quiet, single-scene frame, though, the arc is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single encounter framed by the ongoing condition of a world without tomorrow, with a clear beginning (delivery), middle (questioning of purpose), and end (reaffirmed stance). Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each beat incrementally deepens the central question without disorienting the reader. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing—Mira consciously chooses to continue preserving contradictions—but the turn is gentle and largely intellectual. The lack of a sharper hinge or costed reversal keeps this in the strong-but-not-electric band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: routine inspection → discovery of shells → reading others’ confessions → writing her own → contacting Marcus → new purpose. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: she reorients her relationship and life’s work toward unburied hopes at emotional risk. Stakes and cost are legible even without external drama. The structure is linear, almost classical, without surprising turns, but very solid for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous present-time visit to the station, with backstory about Daniel and the treatment center woven in, building to a clear closure where Maren redefines her relationship to the river and her guilt. Causality is intact: stopping the medication → hearing the river again → seeking graffiti wisdom → mapping to black stones → choosing to pursue self-forgiveness. The closure, a resonant reconfiguration, lands with a legible before/after in how she frames the river’s role in her absolution. The only constraint at this length is that key past events (Daniel’s death, the earlier catastrophic misinterpretation) are summarized rather than briefly dramatized, which slightly blunts structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: mother’s first letter → years of waiting → theft of the watch → arrival at the library → deciphering the system → opening the second letter → claiming her own book and speaking. The structure is a single accumulating scene with tightly integrated flashback, and the closure (forgiveness, watch shifting to forward time, path revealed) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with clear before/after. There are no orientation issues; the rules of the library and watch are taught early enough and paid off. The only thing keeping this just shy of the top band is that external obstacles are minimal, so the mid-scene turn feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and causal: contract → contemplation (coffee/ferns) → identified “perforation” in fate → decision to play → shattering/aftermath, with no teleports or unkept setups. The dominant drive lens is situational with strong causal underpinnings: one ethical dilemma under a clear time and political pressure that culminates in a decisive act. Closure is excellent—the promise breaks, her legal/survival situation reconfigures, and the cultural-stakes outcome is irreversibly altered—with the cost explicitly on the page. Reflection is interleaved with immediate stimuli and choices, so it never blurs the present timeline or softens the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story is cleanly structured: dream → ascent to impossible grotto → encounter with aurora/static → infusion of the emerald → descent with reconfigured understanding. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure moment (chip pulsing with captured essence as she descends) reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (most of the mother is gone; only a fragment remains). The time-pressure (“perhaps minutes before oblivion claimed what remained”) gives the central action urgency without overstatement. No major setup is abandoned, and the ending feels complete at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-time frame of Mira in the tree → tending Theron’s final moments → return to the tree and realization, all coherently causal under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing as Mira reframes contentment and her mother’s “abandonment,” and this lands on the page. Stakes and beats are modest but well scaled to length; nothing crucial feels elided or patched. Some transitions between worldbuilding reflection and immediate scene are a bit smooth/low-tension, making the middle feel slightly floaty rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous consultation scene, causally linked from arrival to ethical reframing to departure. The dominant drive is Situational—the pressure of the moral dilemma coheres and forces a stance rather than generating plot twists. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Sera leaves still burdened but reoriented, with a credible cost (“still burdened, but no longer crushed”). The causal chain is tight with no orientation issues, though escalation is more gentle deepening than sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structurally elegant: one continuous scene with succinct backstory, clean causal flow (training → trance → demonstration → realization), and a coherent closure beat where Vara reframes her task. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: vanishing becomes collision, and her path forward is newly legible. The main limitation is that the village-stakes remain entirely offstage; all decisive movement is cognitive rather than situational, which constrains impact. Still, nothing feels disjointed or undercut, and the before/after is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a quiet accumulative build from appraisal of the canyon’s harmonics to the detection of the wandering pulse, the guiding song, and the traveler’s arrival. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: sensing the pulse → singing → birds relaying response → traveler climbing → invitation to permanent stillness, with no major orientation issues. Closure lands as a form of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Vessa reaffirms her immobility while inaugurating a successor, with a legible before/after in the appearance of the student. The cost—centuries of stillness and the implied loss of future motion—is primarily conceptual and retrospective, but it’s on the page and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: ascent → obstacle (collapsed stair, mist walking) → arrival in the garden → decision not to use the crystal, with closure as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Causality is intact and legible; each step follows from the last, and the keystone choice clearly reframes the initial goal. The drive lens reads as primarily Accumulative/Textural, and the ending honors that. The main limitation is that external stakes remain low and the “world of automatons” pressure is mostly summarized rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: key tag → coordinates → ship → journal → vial → altered perception, with each step motivated by Marcus’s grief and Elena’s hints. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the sunken-library mystery unfolds in a single coherent descent-and-return arc. Closure lands via a clear conceptual shift (he now sees vows’ colors and understands the burden of this knowledge) with an emotional price (distance from ordinary life and from the festival he’s missed). The only slight ceiling is that external obstacles are minimal, so structural tension leans heavily on revelation rather than compounded resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure (coin castings + static interpretations) is clean, and each repetition tightens into the final impossible landing of every coin on edge and the amber glowing. Causality is coherent within the speculative premise: signals run backwards, she translates them, and this culminates in a decisive stance shift. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she reframes “ending” as a mode of “becoming”—with on-page cost in relinquishing survival as a goal. The piece remains a single continuous scene with no orientation debt, though stakes stay more philosophical than situationally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clear and tight: past transgression (loving Elias) and the discovery of recordings set up her present crisis, which culminates in the crystallization sequence and the finishing of the phrases. Causality is strong under an accumulative lens: the old recordings → emotional overload → observatory ritual → completion and partial release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she cannot undo death or her breaking of the rule, but she changes her stance toward grief and her work. Cost is legible in the acceptance that Elias cannot return and that she must still continue reaping with this new, heavier knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: problem (last fish caught) → theory (flow/drip) → attempt (ritual with bell) → partial success (whisper-ring, new current). Causality is straightforward under a Causal lens and the single-scene frame is well handled with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: the universe resumes dripping through an improvised, non-miraculous fix at visible personal risk. The main limitation is that the “price” of success is more conceptual than felt—stakes are enormous, but the personal and situational cost in the final beat is only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: wind chime → reservoir drops → photographs → train-station image → internal reconfiguration and decision to share the truth. The backstory of the evacuation and her father’s disappearance is woven in efficiently and clearly, and the closure—her reframed understanding and concrete next step—is on the page with felt cost. Some middle beats (accumulating photos across buildings) are summarized rather than scened, slightly muting structural sharpness but not harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single scene from arrival in the orchard to completion of the transformation, with clear causal steps (enter sanctuary → prepare crystal → enact ritual → cross back). Closure is strong: she undergoes the transformation on the page and chooses to leave the sanctuary, now altered, which reads as a decisive change with emotional cost (loss of the crystal, end of her prior identity). The drive is primarily accumulative/textural but still causally coherent. The main weakness is that the declared lethal risk (“or she would become nothing at all”) never receives a concrete beat of real peril or near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: radio call → anomalous data → ethical dilemma → long night of observation → dawn reprieve and reconfiguration of her role. Causality is coherent and situational pressure holds: Ash’s demand and the stakes on the ridge force Vera’s stance crystallization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the watcher’s job from delivering certainty to carrying and confessing doubt, with the buckle and logbook anchoring before/after. The only limiter is that the six-hour vigil is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening mid-scene escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: single continuous scene, clear orientation, and a coherent ethical dilemma that moves from dispute → diagnosis → imposed solution. The closure (brain left in sanctuary, the two agreeing to train) reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a visible foreclosing of both women’s initial goals. Escalation is modest and mostly intellectual; the cosmic upheavals don’t materially tighten options, and Kira solves the problem without being seriously challenged. The result is satisfying but not quite gripping at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-POV, single-evening structure with one key turn: receiving the seed reconfigures her stance toward Magnus’s impending offer. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens is coherent—the mystery program → corpse flower seed → conceptual insight → decision to build the unsolvable room and not sell. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she plants the seed and sketches, foreclosing the sale path with clear conceptual cost (lost financial security, redoubled commitment to slow work). The structure does skew reflective and low-action, but it maintains orientation and a legible before/after without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one continuous ritual scene with backstory integrated in service of the present action, and a clear before/after in his relation to silence and contact. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is coherent—he goes to the tunnel, performs maceration via song, endures the emotional trial, and emerges with a new option (calling Margaret) plausibly earned. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration, not a mechanical fix, and the cost of getting there is legible on the page. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one scene with backstory braided in, causally anchored by the intruder’s arrival and Maren’s decision to break her long stasis. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Maren’s stance toward waiting and solitude shifts as she chooses connection, with a felt cost implied in thawing her self-imposed numbness. The causality is straightforward but effective (intrusion → recognition of threat → recognition of kinship → invitation). Nothing crucial teleports or is retrofitted, and the liminal world’s rules are consistent enough not to trouble the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Maren descends with the broken crozier, applies her refined method at the ember nexus, vivifies a new instrument, and commits to disrupting Petra’s binding. The drive lens is predominantly causal with a light accumulative layer; the closure is a decisive change (creation of the severing blade) plus charged poise (the decision to face likely death). Stakes and world rules are introduced early enough and remain consistent. The primary limitation is that the actual confrontation with the empire is deferred off-page, so the on-page cost remains mostly anticipatory.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: climb → failed attempts to tune → conceptual reframe → reception of the shard of hush → descent with reweighted understanding. The causal chain is intact, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing that marks a clear before/after in how signals and endings are understood. Stakes remain low-key and contemplative rather than pressured; failure would simply mean “try again next time,” which narrows the sense of cost. Still, for a lyric, accumulative piece, the progression and cadence land confidently on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: ferry dissolves → grotto arrival → discovery of dual timelines → realization about the hourglass → choice to merge → painful re-entry. The piece delivers clear closure with cost: the passengers are freed, the world has moved on, and Mara is altered and tasked with ongoing work. Structure is tight for the length, with one main scene and one coherent speculative turn. If anything, the final “there were other ferries” gesture gestures outward a bit quickly, slightly softening the impact of this specific crossing’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: entering the gallery, testing an illusion, threading her path, the mirror-room revelation, and the weaving that stabilizes the building form a coherent causal sequence. The accumulative drive (each room adding another layer of perception-as-architecture) supports a clear closure in which her act of weaving reconfigures the situation with cost (a smaller but stable domain). There are no orientation issues, and the fever/backstory interleaving is anchored to present cues. The main weakness is that the gallery’s resistance and her success feel slightly frictionless, so the pivotal weaving solution lands a bit too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with clear before/after framing (old navigation vs. edge geometry), anchored by Vara entering with the chain and leaving it behind. The drive is accumulative/textural—pressure comes from deepening understanding rather than external peril—and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when she abandons the chain and begins tracing stellar edges. Causality is simple but coherent (question → demonstration → realization → renunciation), with a visible cost in relinquishing her lifelong framework, though that cost remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal spine is clean: the dead “call,” Vera answers, the ritual proceeds, and Margaret gains closure while Ruth’s echo resolves—there’s a clear before/after. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration: Margaret can finally sleep, Ruth’s pulse fades, and Vera resumes her work under a clarified sense of its cost and value. Structure is tight and linear with one small coda, and there are no orientation or rule inconsistencies. What keeps it below top tier is the relative ease of the process; there’s no meaningful chance of failure or structural complication once Vera arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: descent, exploration, codex discovery, time squeeze, ascent, and a reflective coda, all causally linked. The closure—a recommitment to naming and remembering, framed by her emergence between tides—is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. Escalation is more atmospheric than eventful, and a slightly stronger on-page crisis beat (beyond the stated narrowing window) would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single ritualized night in the observatory, moving from preparation (radio clearing, ink) through the defragmentation to a clear before/after at the end. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the ink patterns and focused memories gradually intensify until the decisive shift where the digital ghost “dissolved” and she stops counting. Closure is strong and on-page, with a felt price (relinquishing her survival ritual and accepting the full weight of her failures). There are no orientation issues; the scene’s temporal and spatial frame is legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → observation → realization about the birds → tactical use of the diamond → linguistic resurrection and forward-looking exit. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure (language restored, curse dispersed, future labor signaled) is legible with conceptual cost. However, the main problem (how to access lost phonemes without losing her voice) resolves quickly and without any real setback, so escalation feels more like an elegant unveiling than a pressured choice under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain—arrowhead discovery → phone activation → Samuel’s confession → gravitational disturbance → Maren’s realization and decision—reads cleanly and escalates knowledge. The story maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues and lands a clear resonant reconfiguration: the “cryptid” is reconceived as a man’s self-annihilating metamorphosis, and Maren’s project reorients in response. Expository explanation of Samuel’s transformation is somewhat compressed into telling but does not break structure or cost. Closure is solid, with a tangible before/after in how Maren will pursue her research.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear turn when the statue starts climbing and another when she switches from hiding to signaling rebellion. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: years of soft defiance → practiced heart-code → statue’s approach forces activation → resonance shatters the system. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing—the sound-policing order fails on the page, and her new mission is legible. The main limit is that the personal cost of the risk is underplayed; the old enforcement threat dissolves quickly once she acts.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal thread: clandestine route → meeting → exchange of storm and letters → reaffirmation of Marcus’s ongoing mission. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative textural weight around grief and absence) and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus steps “into the gap between moments.” Cost is implicit—risk of drones, ongoing emotional labor—rather than dramatized in a specific threatened failure, which keeps the stakes slightly abstract. Still, the before/after is legible: another promise delivered, his role reaffirmed under consistent constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: wrong turn → discovery of train → discovery of halo and cylinder → attempt to sing → partial recovery of voice and decision to remain. The piece uses an accumulative, lyric lens but still delivers an on-page decisive change with cost: he moves from enforced silence to fragile, reclaimed song and commits to a new life there. Structure is straightforward and well-scaled for the length, with only a slight slide into summary in the final paragraph. The closure is satisfying but not structurally daring or formally intricate enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: odd hours → subtle spatial shift → analog archive reawakening → impossible room → return with reconfigured purpose. Orientation is strong from the opening sentence, and the hyperbolic-geometry turn is prepared and then paid off. Closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Eleanor’s solitude and role are reframed with a new, charged mission. The cost of that mission, however, is more implied than dramatized, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: dream → failed attempts → discovery of Elara’s work → iterative sunrises → fog-morning breakthrough → sustained practice and sharing. Causality is coherent within a lightly speculative frame, and the piece lands a clear resonant reconfiguration closure where Miriam’s relationship to her loss materially changes. The time jumps (over years and seasons) are compressed but legible, and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the outset. The only limitation is that some key beats are summarized rather than fully dramatized, slightly softening the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: arrival at the nexus → star-guided engagement with the stone → discovery of the dangerous idea → choice to transform rather than simply unlock → distant payoff with Elena speaking. Causal links are clear and the closure—Elena’s first word and Mira’s altered burden—lands with a legible before/after. The drive lens is predominantly causal with lyric shading, and that holds consistently. The only weakness is how smoothly the universe-level intervention proceeds; resistance and tactical adaptation are largely summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term forgetting → recognition that her habits have broken → return to the greenhouse and fairy ring → application of the glass-crack/constellation method → discovery/opening of the jar → reframing of her future work. Closure is strong and legible: she regains the memories and reconfigures her life’s drive in response (RR with a decisive internal change in tactics). The single-scene structure is tight and oriented early; world rules for memory-burial and recovery are consistent enough within this folkloric frame. The only thing holding it back from higher is that external resistance is minimal, so the plot’s difficulty curve feels relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene moving from embodied anxiety to consultation, divination, recollection, and a concrete decision, with clear causal steps. The drive lens is essentially causal—tea-leaf reading, recollections, and Thessaly’s prodding all “therefore” into the annotation choice. Closure lands as a decisive change (she recommends reversal and commits to mentorship) with visible future cost. Escalation is more contemplative than strenuous, but the pressure around the council’s looming decision keeps it taut enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: war → refuge in the threshold garden → fading colors → decision to plant the seed → extended process of gathering essence → regenerative outcome. Causality is coherent, and the closure (Marek’s earned stasis, the garden’s renewal, and the implied mission “to remind” worlds) lands clearly with a felt cost in his spent life. There are no orientation issues; the single throughline holds under an accumulative/textural lens. The only limitation is that pressure and consequences remain relatively soft, so the turns, while sound, never feel truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the sanctuary, engagement with the net, accumulating confessions, a crystallizing realization, and a reoriented departure. Causality is tight under a mostly accumulative lens—each knot and confession incrementally shifts both Callum and Mira toward release. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she exits with a new stance toward restoration, with visible cost in the acknowledgement of her prior harm. Stakes remain modestly scaled but fully coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single accumulative scene where the methodical comparison of two videos slowly deepens the strangeness, culminating in Elena’s charged decision to write the report as the chapel “whispers.” Causality under the textural lens is consistent—reopening the investigation leads to the new footage, which leads to realization and a quiet but meaningful closure beat. Closure functions as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she chooses to interpret indirectly rather than confront the uncanny directly. The cost and consequences of that choice, however, are implied more than dramatized, which keeps the arc from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous dive with clear goal (find the Meridian’s final log), discovery (snow globe and pages), and conceptual turn via the captain’s meditation. Causality is straightforward—because she descends and searches methodically, she finds the quarters, then the log, which triggers her internal shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she surfaces with a changed understanding of letting go, tied explicitly to what she’s read. The drive lens reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative, held consistently through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: prior graffiti quests are compressed into backstory, the on-page present builds from the ghost’s plea to Mira’s recognition to the merging-through-song. Causality holds under a textural lens—lightning/thunder as a recurring trigger, the plea “HELP ME REMEMBER,” the mural of feelings, then the song that disperses the ghost. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost’s pattern of encoded expression is transferred to Mira, and her new practice of painting songs completes the loop. Stakes remain intimate and somewhat abstract, but the before/after is legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—elevator ascent punctuated by diary revelations culminating in the observatory release—is clean, legible, and causally coherent. Each floor and diary entry deepens knowledge and narrows the implied path toward confronting Lady Vesper’s preserved grief. Closure lands on-page when Mira begins releasing the jars and Vesper reacts, producing a before/after shift in the emotional order of the household. The cost is more conceptual and emotional than dramatically contested, but it is present and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: tether break → drifting observatory → evolving cloud taxonomy → closing conceptual shift about wholeness. Causality is modest but coherent, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing of “empty spaces” with a sense of Earned Stasis in her decision to continue the catalog. There’s no sharp turn or decisive beat where options markedly narrow, so the emotional cost remains understated. Still, the before/after of her relationship to isolation and purpose is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: coin → deeper chambers → safe → manuscript → realization → exit, all under the ticking demolition threat. Causality tracks, and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing—limits as doorways, blindness as another kind of sight—with an on-page cost in leaving the oak to its destruction. The single-scene window is coherent and well anchored; orientation and drive lens are never in doubt. The only thing holding this just below the very top band is that the external situation never complicates or resists her path; everything she needs yields without much friction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: mystery of the hopscotch board → cipher → realization about the Stranded Luminance → on-page appearance → all-night observation → rescue with consequences. Causality is strong and legible, with each step flowing logically from Elara’s prior choices, and the closure qualifies as a Decisive Change in status and knowledge (from stranded apprentice to discoverer). The cost is present but light—mostly time, strain, and the risk inherent in isolation—which makes the ending a quiet triumph rather than a hard-won one. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence, and there are no glaring set-ups that go unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival → discovery of prophecy and gears → hall of mirrors dilemma → uncap → reconfiguration and descent, with tight causal links. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses to release something irreversible, gains a new understanding of repair, and the silent clock tower begins to tick. Stakes are modest but coherent (her legacy, her calling, the risk of unleashing the vial), and the story doesn’t wander. Escalation is more contemplative than dramatic, but it still narrows options at the vial decision.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: dawn message → tending the grove/children → evening reply → ghost’s reaffirmed stance. Structure is essentially one day with a brief backstory fold-in, which is clear and smoothly handled; orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara invites change, the ghost declines, and the story reframes “not alone” as a chosen distance with cost. The main limitation is that the central day’s events feel more like continuation than escalation, so the inciting “reexamine what we’ve built” is not dramatically tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ascent into the lantern room, exposition folded into action, and a clear causal chain from learning about resonance to recalibrating the clock to sing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the clock freezes at one second to midnight, the beam turns inward, and her act softens but does not cancel the end. Stakes and cost are legible, and there are no true causality breaks. The only limitation is that escalation is more conceptual than dramatized, which slightly mutes the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean causal chain: cursed orchard → groundwater → labyrinth → lost travelers → use of nut to restore the guiding system. Orientation is strong early: we know who Maren is, where she is, and what’s at stake (frost and falls). The closure—Maren emerging with the rescued pair, birds reconfigured, her role accepted—is decisive and legible, with no major logic gaps. The blueprint backstory leans a bit expository, functioning more as justification than as an on-page structural turn, which slightly dulls its structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure—ravine insight → shift in lab approach → three-month jump to test and quiet resolution—is clean, legible, and causally linked. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines what “bonding” means in her work and her relationship to Elena. The main weakness is that some key moves (e.g., months of research) are summarized rather than dramatized, keeping the arc slightly schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure: preparation → reflection → first customer → realization, with smooth causal flow (her parole leads to this job, which leads to this encounter, which reframes her quest). Orientation (“glass orchard library” above the Sea of Sorrowing Mist, Vera on parole) is clear early, and the glimmering bracelet anchors an ongoing constraint. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: the locus of beginnings shifts from place to person/act, keyed to the child’s writing and the bracelet’s dimming. Stakes remain small-scale but coherent, with no structural gaps or dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: fortress → tidal pools as map → descent → pavilion → selective deposition → test with Cassius → coda in the kitchen, all under one coherent drive. Closure lands as an on-page, decisive choice with cost: she refuses total erasure and accepts diminished but persistent pain. The structure fits the length well, with one main escalation centered on discovering the emptiness left in prior visitors. Stakes could be marginally tightened by showing more concrete risk or potential failure in accessing or surviving the pavilion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous night in the tower, pressure building via layered languages and the elevators’ growing responsiveness. Causality is coherent—her three-year plan leads to this experiment, the pendulum and languages shape the attempt, and the humming elevators at dawn provide a clear, resonant closure. The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the world’s meaning is reweighted by the notion that industrial silos can learn communal song, with a conceptual cost around prior isolation. Lack of concrete opposition or a sharper on-page test keeps it below truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: descent → setup of ritual → activation → flood of memories → philosophical reframing offers a clear accumulative arc. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: her preparations lead directly to the reverie and realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—redefining dreams as one continuous human reaching—with a hinted cost (loss of boundary between her desires and others’). That cost remains more conceptual than dramatized, so the ending lacks the sharper before/after edge of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal line: margin doodle → inference about grotto → timed descent → gravity inversion → revelation → re-emergence with new role, with the live clock and inversion rule taught and paid off cleanly. Closure operates as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara exits with new combinations and a redefined identity as guardian, and the final planted doodle locks in the cyclical structure. The cost is mostly conceptual (burden of dangerous knowledge and gatekeeping) rather than dramatized through immediate consequence, which keeps this short of the very top band. Structure is otherwise tight and cohesive with no major unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense problem in the grove, a reflective/history block, discovery of the sculpture, methodological insight, instrument creation, and payoff with the dawn performance. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—each discovery (“wood remembers trauma,” cracks as channels) naturally leads to the next tactic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world remains silent, but options are reweighted by music through touch and root systems. The only ceiling is that the turn from theory to success is almost frictionless, with minimal on-page resistance or failed attempts in the climactic stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: one continuous night at the nexus interwoven with backstory, steadily building toward Helena’s decision to renew and transmit the covenant. Causal links are coherent (her research → journey → sensing the nexus → writing → resolved plan to return and find another exile). Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she commits to sharing her findings despite exile, accepting the cost of carrying this role. Stakes stay modest and largely conceptual, but the arc is structurally sound and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the workshop → ritual with tuning forks → forgiveness declaration → clasp opens → conceptual reframing at the fireworks. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with the ritual deepening her stance until the forgiveness micro-choice unlocks both clasp and realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from seeking information to accepting unknowability at a visible emotional cost. Nothing crucial feels unearned or omitted, and the final image clearly demarcates a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is clean: arrival → orientation to village/philosophy → vigil with the corpse flower → seed found → decision to descend, with each step flowing logically. The closure—her redefinition of serenity and refusal to stay—is on the page and reads as a decisive change with conceptual cost. Structure is straightforward but effective, with one main transition (arrival vs. vigil) and no orientation debt. The only limitation is that the midsection leans more on immersion and exposition than on tightened situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: countdown → hidden grove discovery → revelation during inversion → charged return, all causally linked. The closure unit is a clear Conceptual Repricing: resilience is redefined from a substance to a practice, and her options are reconfigured (she must change behavior at home rather than extract a resource). The clock, the navigation by subterranean rivers, and the unexpected arch formation all integrate into a coherent causal chain with no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the moment of discovery offers little resistance—events unfold in an almost ordained sequence, which softens the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move through one night’s survey, interleaved with concise backstory, toward a charged closing poise where she recommits to listening and warning. Causality is coherent—Vasquez’s death → her methodical investigation → this night’s confirming data and renewed resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event: she’s more certain of the port as a “living instrument,” but nothing in her situation materially changes yet, and no new constraint appears in the final beat. The piece might reach higher if the night introduced a fresh complication (e.g., a near-miss, structural failure, or management confrontation) that tightened options before that last image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal: climb → revelation about the silence → interpretation of the amber sheet → using the aurora to ring the bell → world-level consequence → reconfigured understanding. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and closure is strong via a Conceptual Repricing (wonder didn’t need certification) that reweights everything before it. The main weakness is the lack of concrete resistance or complication in the central action, which flattens the sense of risk even as the outcome is sweeping. Still, the piece lands a clear before/after with cost (the sheet’s destruction, the end of the sculpted hush as it was).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a tight causal arc: climb to Hollow → uncase flute in defiance of vow → play to re-enter the failure → identify the structural flaw in the working → re-case flute with altered future plan. The flashback is anchored and motivated by present stimuli (the Hollow, the relic), and the closure (new knowledge at a moral cost) is cleanly on-page. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light accumulative texture from recurring motifs of silence and thunder. Stakes are more preparatory than immediate, but the structure still lands with a clear before/after in Mira’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the workshop, framed by the vanishing stars and anchored around the halo fragment’s use. Causality is accumulative but coherent—handling the fragment intensifies feeling, which triggers insight, which changes how she sets and reads the type. Closure is a solid Conceptual Repricing: emotion’s nature is redefined for Mira, and her future path (printing more books of questions with a new purpose) is clear with an implied cost of relinquishing the dream of perfect certainty. Stakes are modestly dramatized, but the throughline never wobbles or loses orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-moment ridgeway walk framed with a single reflective arc that tracks her journey across monasteries and culminates in a clarified purpose. Causality is accumulative: each extended stay and encounter with energies builds the pendant’s charge and the myth, leading naturally to the poised arrival at the final monastery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reconceives her job and herself, with Master Hallen’s absence reinterpreted as teaching. The main limit is that the “pressure” on the journey remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete obstacles or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with a legible before/after: arrives to test a theory, leaves having reweighted her need for external proof. Causality is straightforward—prior night’s “loading” of the prism leads to the frost patterns, which lead to her realization—and the accumulative drive (ritual, observation, recognition) holds. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: she accepts singular, unrepeatable truth with personal rather than institutional cost. The stakes remain small-scale and contemplative, but the structural arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: Mei follows the raveling silence, assembles the frame from puzzle edges, activates the bead, contacts the grandfather, and becomes the message. The closure is both decisive and resonant—her literal unraveling into thread with the bead’s final pulse offers a clear before/after with cost. World rules (message via frame + bead + sacrifice) are taught and then paid off without late-breaking cheats. Nothing in the structure undercuts the ending’s impact, and the single-scene focus keeps pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: forge goes cold → discovery of silk → descent via mine shafts → encounter and bargain → return with new method and long-term recovery, with a legible before/after. The single-POV, mostly linear structure with one major off-page time jump (years of labor) remains clear and earns a satisfying closure image (blue forge, revived orchards). The cost—years of effort, the surrender of the silk, and his total recommitment—is stated and conceptually felt, giving this an Earned Stasis / DC hybrid. What keeps it shy of the top band is that the major obstacles (getting lost, danger, negotiation risk) are gestured at but never concretely threaten to derail the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: shard → bay → mapping → rift vision → revelation → renewed commitment, with a legible temporal shard where she witnesses the past. The closure—a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration of her mother’s “abandonment” into sacrifice, followed by a decisive step into the rift—lands clearly with implied cost. Structure is straightforward and appropriate to length, with no orientation debt. The main limitation is that the toxicity risk never quite tightens into a concrete dilemma on the page, so the climactic choice feels safe despite the stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: arrive → explore → discover cairn → read letters → reinterpret the lighthouse/ghost → choose to continue the chain. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is strong, with each physical discovery reweighting the emotional stakes and leading to her final commitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Maren shifting from silent courier to active guardian—with a clear before/after. The cost is quiet but present: she accepts ongoing emotional burden and responsibility rather than walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—ritual ascent, ignition, prophecy, dawn descent—reads cleanly and closure lands as an Earned Stasis: she will keep the compact going at personal cost. Causality is coherent: because she lights and calls, storms respond and the old bargain holds. The main limitation is that the central night never truly departs from the established pattern, so the “before/after” is more tonal than situational. Still, the final descent under rain that falls “exactly where she had called them” gives a satisfying structural click.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene with a clear spine—arrival seeking answers, encounter, revelation via the light, then decision to stay. Causality is coherent under a mostly accumulative/textural lens, with the light’s approach providing the key tightening that triggers Senna’s confession. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: before, she is a visitor investigating her donor; after, she accepts an ongoing role and commitment to this place. Stakes and consequences are more internal than situational, but the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: climb to the study, the sextant’s healing, her reconfiguration of it, the revelatory use, and the dawn descent all link causally and read as one continuous, accumulative movement. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the labyrinth and Maren’s vocation, with a legible before/after. The only softness is how swiftly and smoothly she infers the sextant’s new purpose once it heals, which slightly undercuts a sense of problem-solving struggle. Nonetheless, the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds and the ending cadence is satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: tending the dying orchard → tentative song → mica’s response → ritual swaddling → web of light → global awakening, culminating in her conscious trade of self for collective memory. Causality is legible and satisfying, and the closure (the world beginning to revive at the price of her remaining individuality) lands clearly on the page. The pressure curve is gentle and largely one-directional—there’s little real doubt or resistance—which keeps this just short of top-tier structural tension for a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by the clock, with backstory efficiently embedded and clearly anchored in the present setting. Causality runs smoothly—invitation → arrival → explanation → reframing of her life → choice—under a situational/accumulative lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Miriam’s understanding of her “absence” is repriced, with on-page cost in the form of long-held guilt partially transformed but not erased. Nothing crucial is summarized off-page, and the before/after of her self-conception is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clear and cohesive under an accumulative/textural lens: discovery of the tea house (backstory), the present-morning ritual, the bread as catalyst, and the decision to plant the wheat lead into a quiet but definite closure. Causality at this scale works: finding the bread → re-engaging with the vanished bakery → choosing to plant specific seeds as a response to erasure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—she recommits to her method with a more precise understanding that she’s seeking reprieve, not forgiveness. The only limitation is that pressure does not tighten much beyond reflection; the inciting object (the bread) could drive one more concrete risk or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one unfolding situation (library’s collapse) leading through the search to the choice and departure, under a consistent accumulative/causal lens. Causality holds: star collapses → vows dissolve → she uses her apparatus → discovers the child’s vow → uses the slide → leaves with a reweighted understanding. Closure is strong, with a clear before/after in her stance on preservation versus selection and the library’s literal dissolution. The only limitation is that the middle search phase feels a bit procedural rather than tightening pressure via sharper complications.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the opening, and the causal chain (threat of the recording → locate courier → intercept handoff → escape with cylinder) is tight and legible. The prior failed attempts are efficiently summarized to justify her competence and new strategy. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: she forecloses the path to war for now by stealing the cylinder and committing to destroy it, with the price of ongoing danger implied. The structure is straightforward but solidly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: bluff observation → approach of weather-bearers → exposition about anchors and the forest → charged final realization. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/textural lens: the converging figures bring explanations that reconfigure Vera’s understanding of her brother and herself. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her role and of the brother’s “disappearance,” with the ring’s activation as a clear on-page beat. The main limitation is that the forest election and brother’s fate are resolved largely in exposition rather than dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the letter → search for the chamber → encounter with the hidden painting → decision to answer the calling yields a clear before/after. Causality is straightforward and legible, with no orientation issues and no unkept setups. Closure lands solidly when she not only finishes the portrait but also claims an ongoing change in how she’ll live (carrying the sketchbook openly). The cost is emotional rather than practical, but the renunciation of lifelong suppression reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: postal plate → floorboards → shredded map → journey → Archive → recording → reinterpretation of the mother. Structure is clear despite the time jumps, with reflection anchored to physical cues (the dome, the fragments, the playback station). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mei Lin’s understanding of her parents and of truth itself is reweighted, and she takes a decisive action that reframes the Archive for others. The only thing holding this below the very top tier is that all turns come without much friction—no real obstacles or competing demands complicate the quest once she decides to follow the map.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival → explanation of problem → construction → test → aftermath, with tight causal links. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bell’s restored truth alters the physical world (cleared clouds) and Maren’s stance toward her own voice, with the iceberg’s eventual loss as cost. The drive lens is primarily causal with a lyric overlay and holds consistently. What’s missing at an elite level is any serious doubt that the intervention might fail; the outcome feels foregone, so turns land more as confirmation than hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: magnetic shift → rising static/pressure → retrieval of the box → controlled burn → miniaturization and burial → renewed rituals. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which she forecloses a long-held pattern (containing others’ fears) at visible cost, and the before/after is legible. The beat progression is smooth, perhaps a bit too frictionless—no real obstacles or missteps complicate her solution once she “understands” the box’s role. Nonetheless, the drive lens (largely accumulative with a causal spine) holds steadily and lands with clear cost and change.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: locket → courtyard → Delphine backstory → recognition of the granddaughter → locket’s key → proposed reunion and mailbox opening. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the piece holds a single-scene causal lens with a resonant charged-poise closure rather than a decisive act. The discovery of the key inside the locket is an effective structural turn that reconfigures prior details without feeling mechanical. The only limitation is that the climactic reunion and reading of the letters are deferred off-page, so structural satisfaction leans heavily on implication rather than enacted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a descent, discovery, decoding, embodied processing (dance), and ascent, interwoven with backstory that consistently tilts the present. Causality is straightforward and legible under an accumulative lens; each step logically leads to the next and deepens Marina’s understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Marina’s conceptual shift about fear and vulnerability—paired with the physical act of carrying the journals up. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (weight of legacy and stories) rather than dramatized jeopardy, but it is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: whale beaches → sphere extracted/forbidden → coffee grounds omen → secret descent → flowers offered → sphere cracks → lantern lit → door crossed. The piece holds a consistent causal drive lens and lands an on-page decisive change with Mira choosing to leave through the door. The cost of that choice (what she’s relinquishing in her original world) is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens the landing. Structural transitions (room → chamber → lighthouse top) are legible and temporally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual night with a clear before/after—prophecy virulent vs. prophecy hushed into possibility. Causality under an accumulative/ritual lens holds: reading, preparation, summoning, transformation, and aftermath all link. Closure is solid via conceptual repricing (uncertainty as salvation), though the near-inevitability of success and low on-page resistance keep the arc from feeling truly knife-edge. Still, the progression from night to dawn provides a satisfying frame.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure (sugar → lessons → succession) is clean, with seasonal markers and meteor showers giving a quiet but firm spine. Causal links are clear enough—Voss chooses the narrator, the narrator learns, then inherits—and the ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration as the narrator becomes tutor. The closure unit is strong: “You’re here about the sugar” plus the building’s sigh reframes everything that came before with a felt cost. There are no major orientation or causality slips, just a deliberate softness of overt event.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal throughline is clean: Mirabel steals the shell, goes to the garden where resonance falters, chooses to fill it, and that act triggers Elena’s remembering. Backstory is efficiently woven around present-tense anchors (garden, shell, towers) and never causes orientation loss. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mirabel’s internal stance shifts and the external world answers via Elena’s voice, with a visible price (a night spent pouring out her memories). The only slight weakness is the near-immediacy of success, which edges toward convenience even as the text pays lip service to uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal spine is clean: a long-standing burden leads Veren to the sanctuary to complete the treaty using the key and thorn, culminating in the key’s dissolution and his emotional release. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with backstory efficiently folded in and no orientation issues. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: he forecloses further silence and accepts the moral cost of his “beautiful crime.” The main limitation is that external consequences and jeopardy around the treason remain largely conceptual, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: her lifelong questioning leads to this night’s song, the shell’s activation reveals the harvesting truth, and that revelation directly motivates her decisive silence. The structure—a single scene with interleaved, clearly anchored backstory—supports a strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure with visible cost. The main weakness is that the Council/canyon conspiracy is delivered in a dense expository block rather than partly dramatized, which slightly flattens what could be the most charged turn. Still, orientation is solid and the before/after line in her options is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the opening: who Mira is, where she is, and what she’s doing are all quickly legible. The causal chain from shrine ritual → reading dreams → identifying Elise → uncovering sabotage → deciding to expose holds together smoothly. Closure lands with Elise stepping through and Mira’s decision to testify, but the cost and consequences of that decision remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Very solid structure with a clear, earned end, just shy of exceptional because the on-page price is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single night’s observations layered with backstory and conceptual reveals, culminating in a quiet charged moment as she descends with the whisk and the rain resumes. Causality is modest but coherent (decades of observation → whistling test → confirmation → renewed commitment), and orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: she recommits to her chosen obscurity with slightly heightened poignancy, but the cost and stakes remain soft. The lack of a sharper structural or causal turn near the end keeps this in the solid rather than elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is cleanly causal: orchard anomaly → shredded letters → revelation about the stillpoint/diamond → physical discovery → decision to carry the secret outward. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the investigation through Yuri’s letters is an effective mid-story tightening. Closure lands via a decisive change (taking the diamond, planning dissemination) coupled with a conceptual repricing of the Consortium’s narrative, with implied but not explicit on-page cost. The arc is solid and publishable, though the absence of active on-page opposition or complication during the climax keeps it from feeling fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: radio monitoring → Caro’s plea → Miriam’s counter-offer and broadcast of doubt → cancellation of the assault → pilgrimage upward. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she refuses to sanction violence and redefines prophecy as doubt and listening. The time pressure of “assault… at moonrise” helps structure the scene, and the final image of people climbing concretizes the before/after. The only slight softness is how quickly Caro seems to pivot, but it doesn’t break plausibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: hired to decode the tune → withdraws to dunes and experiments with jars → discovers Samuel → prepares to deliver the truth and recommit to his vocation. Structure is mostly a present-moment frame bracketed around a substantial but legible summary of the investigative process. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he has translated this silence and accepts an ongoing cost of solitude and ache. The main limitation is that most “plot” is recounted rather than dramatized, softening the sense of on-page turns.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Consortium threat → ticking clock → journey to chapel → vibrational matching → release and self-sacrifice, with no major logic gaps. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and the single-scene structure in time and space is easy to track. Closure lands firmly as a decisive change with clear cost—Vera’s dissolution and the bell’s destruction—while reconfiguring the world’s sonic landscape. The only limitation is that opposition remains entirely off-stage, so the plot never quite tightens into an on-page clash.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival and task, discovery of the viaduct, backstory integration, then completion of the measurements and a poised exit toward the wider revolution. Causality holds—her mapping enables timing the storm, which will enable the unyoking—and the magnetic viaduct is a satisfying concrete hinge between sky and politics. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she has completed the work and chosen to embody patience, with a clear before/after in her stance. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than dramatized on-page, which keeps this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous investigative descent that causally reveals the secret tunnel, the smuggling operation, and culminates in Margaret’s decision to go to outside authorities. Orientation is immediate and solid, and the breadcrumb trail from David’s file to Section 47-B to the containers reads as coherent, motivated investigation rather than contrivance. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Decisive Change: she has gathered evidence and fixed a future course of action with implied cost. The only limitation is that opposition remains entirely offstage, so the sense of immediate peril or obstruction is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story holds a simple, coherent causal line: Marcus’s long-held guilt → Elias’s deathbed forgiveness → the visit to Ruth → the commitment to act (repair + letter). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event: he reframes forgiveness and chooses a concrete next step, with the final music-box image echoing this. Stakes and cost are mostly internal and quiet, and while they’re legible, escalation is modest and there’s little sense that any option is truly foreclosed beyond his former passivity. Structure (one scene framed by memory) is clean and proportionate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: discovery/use of the kaleidoscope → articulation of the bell goal → preparation with the arrow tip → launch, capped by the listening bell image. Causality is intact and legible, and the ending lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the world’s possibility space has reconfigured even though we don’t see outcomes yet. The main limitation is that the on-page cost of the launch is more implied than dramatized, so the closure feels more conceptual than pressured. Still, for this length, the arc is coherent, purposeful, and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: strange numbers → Marcus ID → investigation → lie to access servers → revelation of shadow profiles → decision to act. Structure is tight for the length, with a clear escalation from pattern noticing to active conspiracy-breaking and an ending that delivers a Charged Poise closure (she steps into the night with a new, dangerous mission). The Artemis-7 conspiracy is introduced late but still folds back plausibly into Marcus’s obsession and the missing persons archive. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, yet the before/after is legible: passive archivist to active investigator.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: summons → journey (compressed) → mirror encounter → restoration and new stance, with clear because/therefore links. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Kira conceptually redefines peacekeeping and her relationship to her shadows, with the reconstituted crystal as on-page proof. Cost—the years of self-denial and the difficulty of now including herself—is acknowledged but primarily conceptual rather than dramatized through a hard choice. Within this quiet, lyric frame, the single tightening (the fragment drawing from the mirrors) lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: euthanasia plan → stroke → disaster → volunteering → a reweighted relationship to waiting, culminating in a Charged Poise ending. Causality within this lyric mode holds, and the Zurich appointment plus Arctic hazards frame a clear before/after stance. Closure lands as an earned stasis/poise rather than a decisive act, with her non-decision reconfigured as meaningful. Escalation is subtle and mostly reflective, so the structural tension never tightens as sharply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: brief prelude, one continuous pavilion scene, and a quiet but clear closure in the shared fragment and generational reframing. Causality is modest but coherent—Sofia’s arrival prompts revelation, which reconfigures Marcus’s relationship to his own relic. The closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive action, but the before/after in understanding is legible. Stakes remain intimate and cerebral, which slightly limits impact at a “prestige” scale.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: prophet’s threat → line walker discovers/parses the parapet → uses it to save the voices → confronts prophet and consecrates the link. Orientation is solid and the two-shard structure (pavilion → dunes → return) is legible, with a clear closure in the continued murmuring and sealed clearing. The main weakness is the lack of serious complication or reversal; once she finds the parapet, everything proceeds smoothly with little sense of tactical risk. Cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatized, which keeps this below elite-tier tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative and clean: Maren’s weekly invitations lead to specific reconciliations and culminate in the anniversary mosaic, with clear before/after in Thornwell’s emotional life. Causality is mostly conceptual rather than event-by-event, but the chain from photographs → conversations → communal meals → final gathering reads coherent and earned. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the village, once “silent,” is now reaching toward each other before the mosaic. The main limitation is that beats are summarized more than dramatized, so turns in the village’s state sometimes feel reported rather than fully lived-through.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: speak a word, observe the crystal’s response, reflect, then reach a conceptual turn with the tree-growth insight. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated experiments with the crystal lead to the realization that language follows organic growth principles, culminating in the charged final “Begin.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: her work will not change the world, but it redefines language as dormant rather than dead and reframes her vigil as meaningful despite isolation. The cost—her acceptance that she labors for a world that isn’t listening—is clear but understated, keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clear: wake with knowledge → journey through the garden following driftwood → chalk-map revelation → repriced understanding on the walk home. Causality holds under a textural lens, and the closure—realizing his forgetting is a protective mechanism—is an on-page conceptual repricing with cost (he relinquishes his desire for full recall). Orientation is excellent; who/where/when are anchored early, and the reflection shards (funeral, videotapes) are well tethered to present stimuli. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the external “locate before the fog lifts” line of pressure is allowed to soften into a primarily internal realization without a sharp structural tightening at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: Mira brings a problem, Yua names and reframes it, they perform a small ritual, and Mira emerges with a new stance, all in one continuous, legible scene. Causality holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: each step (quake, explanation, leaf, slowing clock) enlarges or reweights the initial stake. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration plus earned stasis—Mira choosing to stay and accept her father’s “escape velocity” has emotional cost that’s visible on the page. The only limitation is that the mountain’s restructuring hints at a larger external arc that never quite exerts concrete pressure on the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: waiting for the blood work creates a simple situational pressure that frames the entire scene, and each step (music, kintsugi, articulated desire) causally deepens Samuel’s stance. The closure is a strong Charged Poise: the nurse arrives with results, their relationship and his internal posture have shifted, and we end at the exact moment of confrontation with a reweighted understanding of fear and hope. Causality is intact and legible with no orientation issues despite the slightly surreal hospice-above-clouds premise. The only limit keeping this from the very highest band is that the external situation has not changed yet; the decisive transformation is internal and quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: bent spoons → old laws fail → Mira goes to observatory → uses key → awakens automaton → learns about noon-shadows → begins sealing loops so they can return. Structure is linear, single-scene, and the closure unit (Mira actively beginning the sealing work as shadows start home) is clearly on the page. The main weakness is the relatively low felt cost or resistance: once the automaton awakens, answers and the required method arrive without real complication or reversal. Still, the piece satisfies a causal drive with a modest but intact sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal progression is clean: return to maze → grave visit → box opened → tooth as evidence → digging → non-human bones → decision to study and search. Reflection is anchored to sensory present (maze, garden, grave) and consistently tilts current choices rather than pausing momentum. Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: she commits to a new scientific and personal path with visible costs (desecration, overturning her worldview). The structure is straightforward but fully coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean single-scene frame with interleaved reflection, operating on an accumulative/textural lens where each memory and action thickens the emotional field. Causality is modest but sound: decades of collecting and polishing, plus avoidance of fire, culminate in the realization that the glass spiral can function as a non-destructive beacon. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Maren reframes her solitude and star-watching through the possibility of shared, fireless light, with a clear before/after in her sense of isolation. The piece could press one on-page decision into a sharper hinge (e.g., a more concrete choice to leave or stay, or to alter the grotto) to heighten structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: viral confession → visit to reclaimed data center → decision to bridge the gap with Thea. Reflection is anchored in concrete present cues (servers, moss, pendant) and consistently reorients back to the scene. Closure lands as an earned reconfiguration of the sisters’ relationship and Mira’s stance toward the past, with a clear before/after in how she holds the pendant and her mother’s narrative. The drive feels accumulative/textural and is held steadily through to the final moss/growth image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: frame at the desk → entry into the nexus → three escalating encounters → realization and return, with a clear before/after in her stance toward finishing. Causality under a mostly accumulative lens holds: witnessing the unfinished characters and hopes drives the conceptual turn that leads to the promise and pen lift. Closure is a strong conceptual repricing—rewriting her relationship to hope and to her work—with a felt emotional cost. The only limitation is that external stakes and constraints remain modest, so the sense of risk is primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear temporal spine (moon setting / sun rising) and a causal chain from preparation to song to revival to resolve. Orientation is excellent within the first few lines, and the mechanical logic of the device and ritual is coherent enough for the mode. Closure lands via a concrete before/after (dead vines → revived vines, solitude → plan to gather others), though the “fix” feels somewhat easy given the decades of neglect invoked. The cost is mostly emotional exhaustion and the admission that this is only a beginning, which is thematically apt but relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrive already mid-ritual, escalate through the introduction of the starlight, and close with the sealing and its distant consequence. Causality is crisp under an accumulative/lyric lens: preparation → activation with starlight → binding → subtle world-shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard now literally encodes a map, and a forgotten heart begins to move toward it. The main limitation is that all obstacles and costs are either already paid in backstory or theoretical, so scene-level jeopardy is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: weeks of preparation → repair → calibration → harvest → aftermath, all in one coherent window. Causality is tight within the lyric mode (her observations lead to hypotheses, which shape the rebuild and the positioning of the timer). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has transformed the cavern’s possibility into a “cellar of wonder” and must live with what that means. Stakes remain modestly scaled and cerebral, but never confusing or undercut.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: arrival → explanation of grotto and need → night of weaving → dawn closure with a distinct before/after where she regains boundaries. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens: each burden collected deepens the weaving and leads to the final reconfiguration. Closure lands clearly when she presses the weaving to the grotto’s heart and receives her name back, with the cost of permanently holding some transformed sorrow. There are no orientation issues or unkept setups at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure framed by the kettle’s slow boil is clean and legible, with a clear before/after in how she now inhabits grief. Causality is modest but consistent: stimulus (kettle, wood, rain) → reflection → micro-actions that crystallize her current life. Closure lands in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise mode with “perhaps this was enough,” reweighting the whole scene. The only limitation is that structural tension never tightens beyond a gentle deepening, so the arc feels exquisitely framed but low in dramatic torque.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the stopped carousel and the ever-moving lagoon, with backstory and overheard stories tightly anchored to the present negotiation. Causality is clear under a situational/accumulative lens: the overheard regret quote leads to a new tactic in the ghost negotiation, which produces a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands on-page when she reframes her regret and the ghost dissolves, with her decision to keep moving as the new stasis. Stakes are mainly internal, so the architecture is elegant but somewhat low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous visit to the terminal culminating in the concrete decision to create and pitch a revival plan. Causality is straightforward—her observations lead to equations, which lead to the 30% capacity insight, which motivates the next-day presentation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she leaves with a plan and a reconfigured sense of the terminal as a guide rather than a tomb. The cost and jeopardy remain conceptual rather than dramatized, so while the arc is coherent, it doesn’t feel sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous dawn scene layered with backstory, driven by the news that the Silencing is weakening and culminating in a concrete new choice. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure mounts through successive realizations (weakening enchantment → subconscious notation → reinterpreting her own records) and resolves in a Decisive Change (she starts the new composition). Closure lands clearly with cost implied in “bearing the weight of hope again.” The only shortfall is that the external discovery (astronomer’s news) occurs off-stage, slightly softening on-page causal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: her legend-seeking history and the tower-keeper’s explanation lead her to the canal, to the chain, to the documents, to the reconfiguration of her father’s story. Structure holds as a single scene with interleaved backstory that consistently tilts the present. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: she now holds both the incriminating truth and the choice of what to do with it. The only limitation is that external stakes remain modest and mostly implied beyond her internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from approach, through decoding, to revelation/decision. Causality is intact—the rope’s patterns yield specific knowledge, then shift to an “invitation” that prompts her new course of action—and orientation is excellent from the first paragraph. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from assuming the weavers are gone to committing to find them, with an implied lifelong cost. The main constraint is that the central turn is more contemplative than pressured, so the arc feels elegant but gently sloped rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure—arrival after the last ship, recollection of Matthias’s “explained absence,” the all-night writing, and the morning departure—coheres under an internal, textural drive. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the single-scene frame with embedded backstory stays legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: healing is redefined, she leaves the pages behind, and departs with the thread in her braid and a “map finally complete,” giving a clear before/after. The only limitation is that external stakes remain minimal, so tension depends almost entirely on interior change, which the story mostly but not maximally exploits.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery → construction → activation → transformative failure/success. Orientation is excellent from the opening—who, where, and what he wants are all clear early. Closure lands strongly as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rules and social/emotional stakes are reweighted by the hybrid creature and the palace’s reaction. The only slight limit is that external consequences (political, practical) remain implied rather than minimally dramatized beyond screams and laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is accumulative: one continuous visit to the lagoon, deepened by well-anchored backstory that clearly stems from present stimuli (sand, lagoon, coin) and reweights the moment. Causality is internal rather than event-driven but coherent: discovery of the lagoon → collecting sand → integrating it into her memorial project → reframing her relationship with fire and legacy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she reframes the “secret” of fire and walks away carrying the jar, with a before/after in her stance toward her past. Stakes and timeline are always legible; no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: frozen geese → failed memory wells → breadcrumb trail → central fountain → sacrifice and key → city restored. The story sticks to a single quest-line with no confusing detours, and the climax (unlocking the fountain) lands with an on-page decisive change and clear cost. The unexplained benefactor who left the breadcrumbs is a mild convenience, but it doesn’t undercut the logic or closure at this length. Structure is tight and appropriate to a short, single-POV, causal design.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and coherent: Veloris in the nebula garden, reflection on prior civilizations, discovery of the gear’s hidden function, activation, transmission, and departure. Causality is solid under an accumulative/textural lens—each realization (about the garden, the gear, the resonance) leads naturally to the next action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a single pattern of generational destruction is conceptually interrupted, with explicit acknowledgment that most worlds will still choose fire. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than plot-driven, but it is clearly on the page in her acceptance of limited impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—greenhouse meeting, instruction, application in sketch, and dinner-table echo—builds cleanly toward a conceptual closure about grief’s shape. Causality is modest but coherent: her question about the mining stone prompts Thomas’s advice, which directly leads to her reframing the Hendricks memorial. Time, place, and the migration “clock” are clear and stable. The main limit is low on-page jeopardy: nothing fights back hard against her goal beyond the difficulty of comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous evening arc with backstory anchored to concrete present cues, building causally from climb → tower → discovery/use of rake handle → commitment to ongoing precision. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she remains the winder, but her relationship to her guilt shifts in a legible before/after marked by the carving and her plan to release the handle. Causality is tight under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens—the communal confessional object reframes her routines without any rule-breaking coincidence. It’s just shy of 9+ because escalation remains relatively gentle, with no major structural risk or surprise beyond the (effective) central device.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine: letter → climb silo → open case → untangle border → coordinates → decision to dig. Structure is tight for a single-scene lyric narrative, and the closure (choosing to act tomorrow, with a reweighted sense of inheritance) reads as a resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens is a Hybrid tilted toward accumulative/textural, and that pattern holds to the end. Cost is conceptually present but light, with no true narrowing of options beyond “learn or don’t learn.”

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival, setup of the commission, contemplation of the past failure, and then the decision to write differently, closing on a reweighted future. Causality is clear under a mostly causal lens: Varen’s request → Mira’s ascent and reflection → her methodical modeling → her choice to frame futures as invitations. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration of what “mapping the future” means, with the cost located in her acceptance of uncertainty and limited power. The piece doesn’t push toward a sharp physical or relational turn, but for this quiet frame, the single deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and easy to follow: past Decrees → present broadcast → glimpses of listeners → quiet post-broadcast coda, all under a single coherent causal frame. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Helena remains in place, but the world has measurably shifted (dust “learning to remember,” a clandestine network stirring), with her danger and sacrifice clearly implied. The main limitation is that no single on-page turning point decisively narrows her options or forces a new tactic; pressure rises modestly (scanner sweep, fox) rather than through a sharp hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous ritual scene anchored by clear who/where/when within the first paragraph, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each step of the scattering ritual deepens the emotional and conceptual frame, culminating in a quiet but decisive closure as Marina accepts her grandmother’s role. Causality is simple but coherent: grandmother’s death → ritual preparation → scattering → acceptance. The cost (accepting responsibility and the impossibility of crystallizing grief) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: one through-line (today’s descent with the cog) interwoven with reflective context about the plague and the New Covenant. Causality is modest but coherent—each beat (finding the cog, musing, archiving it) follows logically from his mission and the setting. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: he recommits to preservation as rebellion, with a clear before/after stance crystallization. The main limitation is that the plot feels more like a slice of ongoing practice than a sharply bounded turning-point day.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: impending program end → retreat to the library → Darius’s arrival and confession → Margaret’s choice to teach again, with the zither as hinge. Structure is simple, one continuous scene with well-handled backstory insertions that always tilt the present. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines “ending” and acts as if this is an inter-movement rest, not a finale. Escalation is modest and mostly emotional, so while satisfying, it doesn’t quite reach the tightest, highest-stakes cadence possible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: alignment of moons → obligation to plant → planting → awakened greenhouse history → rapid growth → harvesting and smuggling knowledge. The once-in-four-centuries window and looming regime sensors give the piece a strong temporal frame, and the closure lands clearly with her walking away pockets full of seeds and implied danger. The cost—inevitable discovery, personal risk, and the irreversible act of rebellion—is legible on the page. Structure is largely linear, with reflection interleaved in a way that consistently serves the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: blackout → woman’s arrival with failing hive → need for recalibration → reveal of memory chamber → bees restored, matchbox passed on. The piece lands a quiet but real closure in Mira recommitting to her role with the riddle now “answered” and ready for the next traveler. The solution via the tower’s residual charge feels slightly convenient and under-contested, with little friction once the secret is revealed. Still, structure is tight for the length and the single-scene progression is easy to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: walk → experiment in the Whitmore house → reframed understanding → departure with a new mission, with a clear before/after conceptual turn. Causality is straightforward (her testing the displacement theory leads to the insight about attention and sanctification), and spatial/temporal orientation is excellent. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of what “keeps a house alive,” with implied emotional cost. The simplicity of the external action and lack of concrete obstacles keep the structural stakes relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: Mira’s search → encounter with the mind-voice → approach to the statue → exposition of the ampoule and cosmology → internal repricing → ascent. The story lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing closure: Mira’s understanding of death and her brother’s fate is altered with a real cost (the loss of her comforting narrative of victimhood and vindication). The drive lens is consistently causal even though it carries conceptual weight. The one structural weakness is how much essential movement happens via Veris’s compressed exposition rather than dramatized friction, slightly flattening the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: dice roll → climb → crack → equations → rupture → new staircase, with a clear before/after and causal through-line under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has crossed a threshold yet remains confined, now powered by the grief-engine she sought. The cost—living inside a perpetual loop of her own regret—registers clearly on the page. Some transitions between abstract concept (perpetual motion) and the physical stakes of the staircase are a touch essayistic, but they don’t damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night in the greenhouse with brief, well-anchored memories and visions, building toward the Budapest email and Maya’s reframed commitment. Causality is mostly accumulative (visions → painting → email → emotional reconfiguration), and the closure—her choosing to continue painting as an act of remembrance—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after. Stakes stay intimate rather than acute, but they’re coherent and resolved on the page. No orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: watching for the beekeeper → teaching bread letters → honey scarcity and cultural stakes → reaffirmed resolve. Orientation is impeccable; who, where, and when are quickly clear, and the grotto routines form a coherent through-line. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she accepts the beekeeper may never return yet commits to continued preservation with bread and painting, with the cost of isolation and likely extinction felt. The main limitation is that the beekeeper setup never faces an on-page turning point beyond “he has not come,” so the external situation stays static even as the internal stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: arrival → investigation → reverse-engineering → activation → crossing, with clear causal links (stone → coordinates → lighthouse → yoyo → temporal door). The backstory interludes (Munich workshop, daughter’s accident) are well-anchored in present stimuli and directly reweight the current stakes. Closure is on-page and legible: he is “already gone,” pulled through the door, with the returning tide closing the opportunity for others—an effective Decisive Change with conceptual cost. There are no major causality slips or orientation debts, and the drive lens (causal with a conceptual repricing at the end) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: drowning → parasitic fear → advisor’s bargain → dream dictionary ritual → confrontation and consumption of fear → altered morning-after state. The two-shard structure (funhouse visit, then dream/morning) is legible, and closure is decisive: her chest is empty, the clasp recharged, and the advisor feeding elsewhere. Cost is present conceptually—she becomes, in part, what he is—but the dream confrontation is somewhat compressed, leaving the victory a touch easy relative to the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative lyric, moving from discovery of new wreckage through interpretation to a quiet, reweighted final image. Causality is simple but consistent: clouds forecast debris and storms, debris arrives and is integrated, and the closing prophecy of “more debris coming” conceptually tightens the pattern. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—her ongoing project is framed as a deliberate answer to the sea’s erasures. The cost, however, is mostly conceptual and historical; there is little sense of options narrowing or a new, riskier stance being taken on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: backstory of the expedition and gate, decoding the message, testing the watchers with the whistle, observing their response, then committing to escape. Structure follows a clear arc from contemplation atop the shell to decisive departure, with no orientation issues. Closure is a solid Decisive Change: she crosses the rusted boundary and rows away, with the price of exile legible. The only ceilinging factor is the relative ease of the escape once she decides, with few concrete obstacles in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—find evidence, weigh whether to expose, then upload to multiple servers—is clean and easy to follow, with backstory woven in via concrete anchors (letter, station, mentor’s coordinates). The piece lands a solid closure: the files are scheduled for release and she walks into the snow, with the before/after on her options and the world’s narrative clearly reconfigured. Pressure is mostly internal; there is no real counter-move from the Institute or external complication in-scene, which keeps escalation modest. Still, for this length, the single-POV, single-location, reflection-forward structure feels coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous night-mission with clear causal steps from arrival, dive, discovery, interpretation, to ritual response and departure. The closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marina re-affirming her role while holding the reunited artifacts—lands coherently, with a legible before/after in the linked E.M. materials. Cost is subtle and mostly implied (her commitment to a lonely, quixotic task), but it is present and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → unusual sensory conditions → discovery of hidden compartment → ledger revelation → reclassification and commemoration of Celia. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the stamp’s meaning, the library’s stillness, and Maren’s role are all reweighted with a clear before/after. The structure is straightforward single-POV, single-location, with no orientation issues. Stakes stay modest and internal, but every beat logically follows and tightens toward the final indexing act.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: loss → obsession with cranes → study/espionage at the basilica → building the lantern → midnight interception of the shadow → successful capture and reconfiguration. Structure is straightforward single-POV with one time-jump (backstory of Lin’s death) and a clear deadline (midnight after the shadow detaches), culminating in a decisive act that reconfigures the situation. The main weakness is lack of real resistance or complication—the plan works essentially as conceived, so the climax feels somewhat low-friction. Closure is solidly on-page and legible as a decisive change with cost implied rather than deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: a single scene framed by the breaker cooldown, with backstory woven in via well-anchored reflection. Causality is coherent (cooldown → calculations → anomaly spike → renewed commitment), and the drive lens feels accumulative/textural with a clear Charged Poise ending. The main limitation is that the central pursuit never faces a concrete on-page obstacle or reversal beyond the already-reset breakers, so the closure lacks a strong narrowing of options. Nonetheless, the before/after in conceptual framing (“unused potential” vs. “wasted hope”) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is tight and linear: arrival → comparison of chips → activation of mechanism → revelation → decision to continue, all causally linked. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira reframes her quest and takes concrete action toward the next observatory. The main limitation is that obstacles are minimal—almost every step succeeds on first try, so escalation feels gentle rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—letter → nightly penance → discovery of the carving → spoken confession → new vow—is clear and satisfying within a single continuous frame. Backstory is anchored cleanly to present stimuli (the terrace, the carvings, the letter’s aftermath) and never muddies orientation. Closure lands as a decisive internal turn plus an earned stasis: she chooses the arduous path of restitution, accepting ongoing grief. Stakes remain personal rather than externalized, but they’re coherent and scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: we’re anchored quickly in who/where/why, the exchange unfolds in one continuous scene, and closure lands with the sibling reunion and deferred reckoning. Causality is straightforward—Mira’s terms and professionalism lead to a smooth exchange under agreed rules—without contrivance. The cost is quieter and internal (the unresolved road between apology and forgiveness), but it is clearly articulated on the page. What holds this below top-tier is the near-total absence of complication or jeopardy in the exchange itself, which flattens the central set piece.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous kayak outing framed by reflection, with clear orientation (who/where/when) and no causality breaks. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Situational, with each observation (utility poles, compass, cormorant, memories of Marcus) tightening toward the closing stance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—she continues forward with the broken instrument and a flicker of faith rather than a dramatic reversal. The main limitation is that the escalation is very gentle; the stakes deepen more in thought than in concrete changes to her situation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: breadcrumbs → lake → object from the future → moral test embodied by the labyrinth. Exposition about time-sent objects and the procedure arrives in a single chunk but doesn’t derail orientation or undercut stakes. Closure lands as a charged poise moment: Marcus commits to a path that will test him, with clear before/after in stance. The structure is straightforward but solid for the length, with no major unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecy → long refusal → rare window after phoenix rising → ritual → metamorphosis → reunion → acceptance of cost. Closure is strong and legible as a decisive change with a lasting price—she forfeits an ordinary human life to regain her brother’s presence. The single-scene structure holds without confusion, and the backstory is anchored tightly to present action. The only soft spot is how smoothly the ritual succeeds, with little on-page jeopardy beyond the pre-declared cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: climb → ritual → threshold → retrieval → descent, with clear causal “because/therefore” links. The core drive (find and reclaim lost time) is announced early and paid off concretely via the card-door and firefly-like memories. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—Morrigan regains memory and reframes her “failure” as a cost of transformation, then physically returns to Iris. There are no evident orientation or rule-breaking issues; the magic system is sketched but coherent enough for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear: collect tears via others’ shadows → reach 99 → confront the avoided final photograph → unlock the dimension with the completed vessel. Structure stays tight within one continuous frame with flashback efficiently woven through on-page tasks. Closure is decisive and legible—she opens the locked dimension and alters the last child’s prospects—but the process feels nearly frictionless once she chooses to face her own shadow, with no real risk of failure or alternative outcome dramatized. The cost is mostly conceptual and back-loaded rather than pressured in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one present-time ritual framed by concise backstory, all driving toward the release of the jars and a reframing of the prophecy. Causality holds—her past giving leads to poverty, that leads to this pilgrimage, the geologist’s warning forces the beach detour, which in turn pays off the “fire meets water” prophecy. Closure is strong as a resonant reconfiguration: she reconceives both “transformation” and prophecy, and the empty jars/full understanding image lands with a felt price. The only constraint on a higher score is that the pressure curve is gentle rather than sharply tightening, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: decoded sundial → discovery of the mint → recruitment of allies → engineered blackout → dispatch of evidence and messengers. The drive lens is clearly causal, and the closure—Maren having irrevocably set a revolution in motion while resuming her post—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with implied cost. However, several key moves (recruitment, gathering evidence, risk of discovery) are summarized rather than dramatized, which softens the structural punch. Still, orientation is excellent and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: vanished friction → need for answers → ritual with rocks → anchored vision via star dust → realization of the reversed patterns → decision to deploy the eels. The piece lands clear closure as a decisive change in stance—Meren stops fleeing her curse/knowledge and begins actively reshaping reality. Stakes and rules are introduced early and followed through without contradiction. The main limitation is that the climax resolves at the level of plan and realization rather than dramatized consequence, muting the felt cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → timer start → envelope opening → revelation → renewed speech, all under one tight temporal window and a literal countdown. Causality is strong (father’s artifacts → discovery of mother’s resistance → reinterpretation of scars → decision to act), and the darkroom-timer frame gives an effective scaffold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she shifts from self-erasure to active, risk-laden resistance with a clear before/after. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the accumulative pressure by textural beats is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: waiting → confrontation → duel → reconfiguration of the political situation, all causally linked. Orientation is precise and the causal chain around the sundial, hidden overture, and Krell’s reaction is easy to follow. However, the crucial duel is summarized in a single “When it ended” paragraph, so the decisive change lands more as asserted outcome than dramatized cost. This summary handling at the climax keeps the closure from fully earning its emotional and tactical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a present-night frame of arranging books under the stars, intercut with prison and post-collapse backstory that all clearly feed the current sanctuary. Causality is sound—meeting Ezra, sorting books, prisons collapsing, discovering the ruined library, rebuilding, growing a network—each beat logically scaffolds the present situation. The closure beat (“The resistance blooms in fractures… Always together. Always under stars.”) reconfigures the earlier images into a stable charged poise rather than a decisive turn, which fits an accumulative/lyric drive. The main limitation is that no new information or concrete change occurs in the final moments beyond re-articulation of the existing pattern, softening the sense of before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious delivery → decoding hidden footage → recognizing the compass system → time-limited alignment → musical beacon → his arrival and reunion. The story lands a clear before/after: from suspended stasis to a completed return and a clock whose purpose is fulfilled. The world’s “impossible navigation” tech is sketched just enough to support the plot without bogging it down. Stakes and timing are coherent and closure carries a felt cost of years lost and risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene framed by the incoming monsoon, with backstory and prior attempts folded in to build pressure. Causality reads clearly—failed scientific tests → resorting to ancestral dream method → unconscious planting → reinterpreting her role—with no teleports or rule-breaking. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes the need to verify outcome and redefines her duty in light of the seed’s uncertain fate. The only minor weakness is that the monsoon’s arrival feels more like a symbolic cadence than a concrete test of her choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-time arrival → receipt of lace → realization of its code → climb to the cottage → silent exchange, all causally linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship state shifts from estrangement to a fragile but real mutual acknowledgement, with cost spelled in decades of regret. The “ghost ship’s compass” and lace both pay off at the end without feeling like late rule changes. Escalation is more emotional-textural than event-driven but coherent under an accumulative lens.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative trajectory, building pressure through sensory details to a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is strong and legible: the decision to demolish the greenhouse (cost) while preserving the slides (reconfiguration) lands effectively. The narrative arc moves seamlessly from the practical "stripping of drama" to a deeper, more complex acceptance of decay.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central plot mechanic—using natural frost patterns to decode a smuggler's artificial cipher—strains credibility and functions as a deus ex machina, lacking causal groundwork. While the closure (Decisive Change) is clear, the "magical key" solution undermines the otherwise grounded reality of the piece. The narrative relies on this unearned knowledge leap to bridge the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean, linear accumulation of successful tests leading to an epiphany. While the closure (conceptual repricing of sound) is resonant, the narrative lacks a moment of significant doubt or complication to earn the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clear, moving from disruption to ritual to resonant closure. The middle section relies on summary ("For seven nights") rather than dramatized scenes of burial, which softens the causal texture, but the dream-logic transition and resolution land with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is a coherent vignette with a legible ending (the photograph), but it lacks causal tension. The "danger" of ringing the bell is established in dialogue but never tested on the page; the mission proceeds without obstacles, making the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where a problem (grief) is introduced and immediately solved by a magical ability without complication. The ending lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" for closure; the healing is a gift that demands nothing from Mei-Lin, resulting in a convenient, unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the "halo fragment" and the garden's geometry, leading to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara trades her human form for temporal permanence. The closure lands with undeniable cost (dissolution of self) that strictly follows the established logic of the retrocognitive trap.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and the "music keys" puzzle provides a satisfying, if slightly familiar, beat of competence. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (securing the seeds), but the central obstacle (the scout) is resolved through a "speech check" that lowers tension without exacting a visible on-page cost from Mira herself. The causal linkage is strong, but the ease of the resolution limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure creates a perfect crucible, using the physical process of the forge to manifest the internal conflict. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the device is finished, but its meaning has shifted from forensic curiosity to a painful artifact of self-knowledge. The decision to send it acts as a decisive external move.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative is linear and relies on convenience; the heist proceeds without a snag, and the "guards" mentioned via flower codes never manifest as a genuine obstacle. The closure is a purely positive resolution without a felt cost or complication, and the mechanics of the decoy swap (hiding a glowing object from an obsessive collector) rely on suspended disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving logically from the inciting entry to the decisive closure of choosing community. The orientation is clear, though the progression is linear and relies on a "power works on the first try" beat that lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality is severely damaged by the resolution mechanism: a four-year-old child writing legible dates and conversation snippets on a cast, which are then decryptable from a thirty-year-old newspaper photo, breaks suspension of disbelief. The magical recording properties of the seashell further clash with the grounded thriller frame.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is solid, effectively using the dying stars as a countdown to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the plot is strictly linear and procedural—the oracle simply waits and performs the ritual—lacking a moment where the plan fractures or requires tactical adaptation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building effectively to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the act of sweeping is conceptually repriced as sacred. The loop mechanism provides strong logic for the lack of surprise, though it slightly dampens immediate causal tension by making the outcome feel pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scene follows a coherent Situational arc with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure via the exchange of the lens. While the inciting pressure is low, the final beat lands with a legible cost as Mira relinquishes her tool of emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is tight, using the "cracked marbles" as a brilliant objective correlative to anchor backstory in the present. Closure is decisive and resonant, though the resolution relies heavily on dialogue explaining the theme rather than purely dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "hypothesis-experiment-validation" structure with zero complications, failing to generate causal friction. The closure is a "soft" confirmation of what she already believed, lacking a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The stakes regarding Dr. Vasquez remain theoretical and off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Causality relies on significant convenience; the antique program floating intact after weeks of flooding strains credibility, and the ghost's specific instructions reduce the protagonist's investigative agency. The closure works, but the path there is paved by supernatural assistance rather than earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a masterful example of Earned Stasis/Renunciation, landing with the conceptual cost of carrying a world-ending secret alone. The drive lens holds firmly, turning a quiet conversation into a decisive, stance-crystallizing moment with clear before/after states.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and cohesive, with excellent orientation. However, the plot relies on significant convenience: Marcus locates the specific valve room and his sister's specific amber bead ("near the top") instantly, lacking the complications or obstacles that would earn the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative operates almost entirely in summary and habitual mode ("Each morning," "She would return," "She had learned"), lacking a specific, dramatized "now" scene. While the trajectory of understanding is clear, the absence of a singulative event or turning point flattens the structure into a vignette or prologue rather than a story with active causality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is functional and legible, centering on the eclipse as a catalyst for the gift. However, the resolution is reached without significant friction; the daughter's acceptance is immediate, making the closure feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure is a linear treasure hunt devoid of obstacles; the protagonist finds a clue, uses a special power to decode it, and immediately intuits the solution. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, it feels unearned because the "listening" ability bypasses the necessary struggle of investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is solid, using the journalist's impending arrival as effective pressure to force a resolution. The closure (boxing the specs) is a clear Decisive Change, though the middle section relies heavily on reflective summary rather than active scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scene structure is solid, with clear stakes established immediately and a logical progression of the "exorcism via argument" concept. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of faith and doubt, though the resolution feels slightly intellectualized rather than viscerally earned through the stated time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative arc, where pressure builds through the climb and the waiting to a breathless release at sunrise. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with significant conceptual weight, recontextualizing the protagonist's longing into a forward-facing legacy. Causality is tight, with the grandmother's gift and the protagonist's career converging perfectly at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from suspension to descent and realization, but the turning point relies on a sudden internal epiphany ("The realization struck like lightning") rather than causal pressure. The closure lands on a conceptual reconfiguration, but without a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the protagonist arrives, receives a magical object, and is healed. The closure lacks a "felt cost" or "decisive change" driven by agency; the resolution—tears and a return of feeling—acts as a soft reset rather than a reconfigured stance with consequences. The "magic feather" resolution simplifies the complex issue of emotional numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting discovery of the tube to a decisive resolution (intention to publish). Orientation is established quickly. The closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change with a shift in tactics, though the mechanism of "distributing through channels" feels slightly convenient given her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "tour guide" structure where a secondary character (Dr. Vance) explains the stakes and backstory before the protagonist performs the scheduled action. The closure lands on a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of grief, but the lack of causal obstacles or meaningful complications makes the progression feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a causal arc or meaningful tightening; the encounter generates no new options or costs. Closure relies on an unearned POV shift ("Jerome Wells smiled in whatever came after") that breaks the established frame to force a sentimental resolution. The ending is an "and then" continuation that fails to reconfigure the stakes or the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is solid, with a clear trajectory from attempt to failure to realization and success. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where she reprices "imperfection" as beauty. The pacing is effective, though the transition hinges on a reflective pause rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, but the structure is strictly linear with little complication. The resolution comes via a convenient external communication (the chemist's embedded message) which lowers the narrative tension and makes the closure feel like a soft landing without sufficient cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on a multi-month summary montage ("The next morning," "Every Thursday," "September") rather than the required dramatized scene or shard structure. This synopsis-like compression drains tension and prevents the formation of a valid closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Weeks passed," "One dawn") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, bypassing the opportunity for a decisive turn or escalating pressure. The resolution—finding Senna—feels coincidental rather than the result of a specific, high-cost choice or deduction. Closure is valid as a Conceptual Repricing, but the path to it lacks causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. While the mechanics of the climax ("becoming the silence") operate on poetic rather than strict causal logic, the established cost and thematic coherence carry the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid, following a clear causal chain from preparation to ritual to realization. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of her grief. The climax relies heavily on the apparition explicitly explaining the story's lesson, which weakens the dramatic tension of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative moves clearly from trigger to action, but the causality is soft; the decision to leave the letter hinges on a convenient sighting of a crying child rather than escalating pressure. The "why now" feels poetic rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tightly structured, moving from the inciting discovery of the leaf to a decisive internal resolution at the trellis. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; Vera's choice to become a "translator" recontextualizes her existence with a legible conceptual cost (loss of humanity for a new hybrid state). The pacing supports the "fable" quality without sacrificing causal momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative logic, moving from isolation to connection through the "rain trails" device. While the climax relies heavily on coincidence (the rain pointing to the exact display case just as Theo arrives), this fits the fable-like tone. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's art, providing a satisfying, if slightly tidy, ending.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully executing a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist revalues her gift. However, the climax relies on a "misunderstood monster" trope that deflates tension instantly rather than forcing a difficult choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on montage ("Day after day," "Families began visiting") rather than constructing a distinct scene with urgent causality. This summarizing approach flattens the arc, preventing a genuine climax or an on-page closure unit derived from specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (entering the door) is a distinct change of state. However, the progression relies on situational convenience—the cracks appearing exactly at midnight and the door simply opening—which lowers the sense of earned causality. The resolution feels mechanically efficient rather than dramatically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure, though the "quantum threads" explanation clashes tonally with the ancient fantasy setting. The logic of the memory transfer holds within the soft magic system established.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The plot relies heavily on the external force of the storm to break the prison, reducing the protagonist's agency in the inciting phase. The middle section summarizes the conspiracy beat, skipping the causal chain of persuasion, though the closure is structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, with the return of the ink pot providing a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the debt. However, the closure is slightly undercut by the final paragraph, which over-explains the resolution rather than trusting the dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works well for a lyric vignette, effectively layering the history and the ritual. The closure—Earned Stasis—is quiet but resonant, reconfirming her role against the town's forgetting. It lacks a sharp causal turn, relying heavily on the concept's inherent interest.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the closure creates a valid decisive change, the pivotal turning point relies on a significant coincidence: the protagonist happens to be beneath the exact container where two men explain the specific plot. This "talking heads" exposition undercuts agency and creates a convenient bridge for the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, delivering a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist trades certainty for wonder. The "acoustics" defense offers a necessary beat of causal resistance, though the transition to acceptance is swift. The closure lands with a legible conceptual cost regarding her past identity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure relies on summary at the most critical juncture; the meeting where factions "hammered out plans" is glossed over in a montage ("talked until dawn"). This robs the story of its central dramatic scene, replacing necessary conflict with retroactive description.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and tight, using the chemical timers to create a distinct rhythmic structure that propels the scene. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the memory is preserved while the reality is lost—lands with genuine emotional weight. The transition from the father's method to her adaptation is handled efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc that lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending returns to the status quo without a price paid, rendering the closure purely procedural rather than narrative; the potential tension of the deadline is dismissed rather than engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal lens is watertight: the falcon’s return triggers the map reading, which forces the immediate departure before the ice shifts. Closure is a Decisive Change that lands with the visible cost of leaving the outpost’s light for the “unmapped territories.” The pacing effectively utilizes the short shard format to deliver a complete arc.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is elegant and effective under an Accumulative lens, moving rhythmically through the three-day ritual to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure. The twist—that she is burying the town rather than saving it—re-prices the central action meaningfully. The ninety-year coda serves as a necessary validation of the "seed" metaphor, offering legitimate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative establishes a clear causal chain, but the closure suffers from a logical gap regarding the "proof." If Marina successfully records her own memory into the vial, she has demonstrated the technology works, contradicting the story's insistence that she returns without proof. This discrepancy weakens the cost of her decision, as the professional sacrifice relies on an unearned distinction between "science" and "witness."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scene builds tension effectively, but the closure relies on a logical gap regarding the "proof." If the monster shatters into sound and light, Milo is left with only a broken lattice and nearby corpses; the text frames this as vindication, but causally it points to him being framed, creating an unresolved dissonance between the triumphant tone and the likely outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure where the placement of the final bead triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the return of the sun). The closure is definitive and firmly anchored in the premise. However, the timing relies on a convenient generational math ("four generations... building toward something") rather than a specific, pressure-driven catalyst unique to this night.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and effectively utilizes an Accumulative drive lens, building density toward the act of sewing. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (prison to garden), but the lack of a significant "snag" or risk of failure makes the progression feel linear and inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" where the conflict is resolved by a magical functionality (fixing the gnomon creates light) that feels unearned by the prior excavation setup. The timeline compression ("On the third day," "spent another week") dissipates tension and lowers the immediate stakes of the scene. Closure lands as "symmetric satisfaction" with no visible cost paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural that lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the ending confirms the status quo without exacting a legible price from the protagonist, resulting in a low-tension vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is tight and causal; the progression from gathering fragments to realizing the full conspiracy leads naturally to a strong Charged Poise closure. The ending successfully reconfigures the situation—she is now armed with the map and a plan.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative achieves strong closure with the delivered apology, resolving the central tension. However, the climax depends heavily on external agency—the shard heating up and the spirit guiding her—which somewhat undermines the protagonist’s active role in the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is flawless, utilizing an Accumulative drive that coheres perfectly around the decoding of the cast. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical removal of shrapnel parallels the decision to release the brain coral—lands with distinct conceptual and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative functions as a cohesive vignette with clear orientation, but the closure relies on a low-stakes realization ("joy is a practice") rather than a decisive change with felt consequences. The absence of an obstacle makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, anchoring the inciting mystery and resolving it through a logical, if slightly metaphysical, shift in tactic. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "unfinished" mural is recontextualized as a participatory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative is a linear recruitment scene without significant reversal or obstacle. While the logic holds under a causal lens, the closure arrives via simple agreement rather than a pressure-forced choice, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story relies heavily on backstory summary (~70% of text) to establish significance, leaving the present timeline thin. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing of "beauty") is legible, it is reached through memory and exposition rather than a causal chain of dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path (problem → ritual → success) with clear orientation. However, the resolution relies on a convenient device ("a machine that could light forgotten things") that functions as a deus ex machina, resolving the central tension without requiring ingenuity, sacrifice, or a difficult choice from the protagonist. Closure lands, but the cost is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Causal arc within the short scope, using the Veth'ari concept to bridge the inciting estrangement and the closing reconciliation. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "cost" is the surrender of their protective narratives (blame and avoidance). The structure is tight, with the deadline ("tomorrow he would leave") providing effective pressure that necessitates the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is solid, employing a clear discovery-to-decision arc. The pivotal "adhesive analysis" beat relies on a slightly convenient technological shortcut (dating glue to the exact year in a cave) which strains credibility, but the subsequent decoding and decision-making provide strong, character-driven closure. The pacing effectively mirrors the "breathing" of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is decisive and resonant, with the confession marking a clear irreversible change in Elara's strategy. However, the heavy reliance on summary to bridge the timeline between the meteorite's arrival and Mira's visits dilutes the scenic tension compared to a continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from stasis to realization to release under a Hybrid lens. The closure is a Decisive Change (crossing the threshold), but the mechanism—the father suddenly sensing her because she is "ready"—relies on soft magical causality rather than a concrete on-page price paid by Wren. The POV shift to the father, while confirming the connection, resolves the external conflict externally.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear vignette operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of her internal stance toward belonging—is legible and earned by the shared focus. However, the lack of causal friction or obstacles (Theo is immediately accommodating; the fish appear on cue) lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "lucky find" (the seeds) to resolve the central mystery, violating the principle that coincidence should complicate rather than solve. While the final Conceptual Repricing (resignation to release) is clear, the causal chain leading to it is gifted by the environment rather than earned through the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear success path: plan, execution, reward. While the "window" structure works, the closure is merely the successful completion of a routine without visible or felt cost. The disruption (the child) is absorbed too easily to function as a true complication or turn.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative is a linear ritual enactment with a soft Causal lens; the outcome is never in doubt. While the closure provides a clear reconfiguration of Kira's state, the lack of obstacles or complications flattens the dramatic arc into a procedural sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting pressure of demolition to a resonant closure (Conceptual Repricing). The causal link between the stone-throwing and the realization is lyrical but legible. The orientation is established quickly and anchors the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is exemplary for the length, with a clear physical ascent mirroring the internal struggle and the paralysis providing a distinct crisis point. Closure is definitive and resonant: releasing the ashes while keeping the broken box creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative suffers from a massive causality gap: the leap from visual patterns (three beads in a triangle) to specific, actionable data (Dr. Hoffman in Geneva) is purely convenient and unearned. The closure brings a decisive change (a new plan) but lacks any visible or felt cost; the solution is dispensed by the setting like a vending machine, violating the requirement for a cost-bearing resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a "loot-drop" linear structure (enter, find artifact, receive explanation, feel validated) that relies heavily on the coincidence of finding the exact diary needed to decode the setting. The closure acts as a Conceptual Repricing (the walls dream of being understood), but it lacks a felt cost or sacrifice, reading as a convenient philosophical victory that validates the protagonist's starting worldview without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette describing a process rather than a causal plot with escalating complications. While the "bells" provide a faint ticking clock, the story lacks a decisive turning point or inciting incident within the scene; she arrives, succeeds effortlessly, and departs.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scene is structurally sound with clear orientation and a legible drive lens (Situational/Atmospheric). The closure works as Earned Stasis—peace as endurance—but the central turn (the signing) meets little on-page resistance, resolving the immediate tension with efficient dialogue rather than a more difficult tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    The single-scene structure is solid, with the approaching storm providing a functional ticking clock that drives the ritual to completion. The backstory regarding the drought halts momentum in the middle third but successfully contextualizes the irony of the rain's return. Closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the timing of the rain feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a distinct closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression is ritualistic and smooth; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or reversals that threaten the outcome, reducing the narrative drive. The ending successfully reconfigures her status, but the causal chain lacks the tension of a high-stakes turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, using the puppet show as an effective scene-within-a-scene to externalize the conflict. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the symbols in the dust) that feels earned and final.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—the butterfly interacting with the wing—is resonant and earns its emotional payoff. The "knot-reading" logic borders on magical realism but fits the established premise; the ending effectively reconfigures the loss into an act of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure, where the definition of permanence is repriced. While mechanically sound, the progression is somewhat linear; the ritual works on the first attempt described, lacking a pivot point where failure seems imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent and provides closure via a Resonant Reconfiguration (changing her relationship to the future), but the causality is linear and instruction-based. The climax relies on an epiphany-via-vision ("Dreams flooded her waking mind") to explain the plot mechanics, rather than a realization earned through active struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving logically from preparation to revelation and departure. The closure—a quiet confirmation and acceptance of obscurity—works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The lack of active external obstacles (the interregnum provides safety rather than pressure) lowers the tension curve.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and provides clear closure, but the progression is linear and lacks resistance; the intervention succeeds immediately without complication or cost. The middle section functions as a smooth procedure rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving cleanly from the discovery of the tool to the ritual execution. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist asserts control by pausing the pursuit, a choice that feels consistent with the established magic system and character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and the closure—reconfiguring the "deciduous vows" through the passing of the ribbon—lands effectively. However, the trajectory is linear with minimal causal complication; the discovery of the bag is convenient, lacking a "tightening" beat where failure seemed possible.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Situational drive lens, moving from arrival to exploration to realization. However, the pivotal turn relies on a "magic mirror" moment where the protagonist simply "understands" the complex mechanics of her inheritance without an on-page causal catalyst or test. Closure is present (carving the map), but the path there feels explanatory rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal path to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure, but the turning point relies heavily on the diary providing the exact answer ("It keeps us safe") right when needed. The Time Traveler's warning of "seventeen failures" is deflated too easily by Mira's instant success, reducing the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a linear path to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the solution (storytelling) perfectly cures the problem (erasure) without complication. The resolution feels unearned because there is no visible cost or sacrifice demanded of Maya to reverse a metaphysical condition; the ending is tidy rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on a significant convenience (finding the exact seal needed "that morning") to bridge the gap between the door and the solution. The narrative arc is linear and lacks a "try/fail" cycle; the problem is identified and solved immediately without complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is seamless, moving from the inciting pressure of the noise to the specific, skill-based discovery of the chamber. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts her smaller territory, transforming from a mapkeeper of the whole to a guardian of the refuge. The causal link via the ice patterns is precise and rewarding.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative drive is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible. However, the plot relies heavily on "movie timing"—discovering the prism just days before the exact millesimal alignment and arriving at the beacon exactly as the last ember fades—which strains credibility and feels like a convenience rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from observation to a decisive act of historical revisionism. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the archivist's role from preserver to sculptor—lands with clear conceptual cost (the loss of objective truth). The drive lens is Causal and holds steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The grandmother's return functions as a deus ex machina that relieves the central pressure (isolation) rather than escalating it. Additionally, the "note in mosaic" strains credibility regarding the time and effort required to set tiles for a fleeting message.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure works well, using the pause in conversation to expand on the backstory and context. The closure is distinct (Resonant Reconfiguration) and legible, though the resolution relies heavily on a monologue to dissolve the conflict rather than active struggle. The causality holds up under the lens of emotional revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clean accumulative arc where the gravity inversion effectively forces a stance shift. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, deferring the final collection to choose immediate growth, which feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is clean and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the terrace's acoustics—lands with emotional weight. The logic of the magic system is consistent, though the "train whistle" timing relies slightly on convenient coincidence (Kairos) rather than forced causality.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear causal path with clear orientation and a distinct objective. The closure is strong, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the keeper becomes the maker of history, though the lack of significant setbacks flattens the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from isolation to a decisive opening of the door (Resonant Reconfiguration). The causality holds under a Hybrid lens, though the "fading threshold" acts as a convenient situational pressure that forces the issue somewhat rapidly, making Mira's capitulation feel slightly too smooth given the three-year weight of her solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving efficiently from the inciting incident (3:47 AM) to the resolution (diamonds). The logic of the magic system (pressure = diamonds) is established and followed. However, the resolution relies heavily on pre-established competence ("Vera had been practicing") rather than a dynamic, in-moment tactical shift, which lowers the dramatic tension of the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is coherent, but the central turning point relies on a magical exposition dump ("The silence spoke first") rather than causal action. Closure is a functional Resonant Reconfiguration (crank becomes key), though the cost is low.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change, but causality relies heavily on the program functioning as an instruction manual that solves the central problem. The resolution feels discovered rather than forged by the protagonist's agency or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, employing an accumulative lens that effectively transitions into a specific causal discovery. The closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, with Eleanor accepting her persistent heartbreak as the price of connection. The "reading dust" logic frames the story well, though the stakes remain low and purely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on retroactive preparation (the decoy explosion revealed only when needed) and "magical" convenience (puddle reflections as a precise map) to solve problems. Closure is a "clean win" with no visible or felt cost; the protagonist succeeds completely and returns to the status quo without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean causal arc to a definitive closure where the prophecy is shattered, satisfying the Decisive Change requirement. However, the resolution feels unearned due to a lack of immediate, on-page cost; the victory is described as "harmless" and "beautiful," missing the necessary friction or sacrifice that creates a resonant literary ending.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative moves efficiently from setup to resolution, but the linear structure lacks a significant reversal or complication. The closure functions as a gift/ascension without the required visible or felt cost, reducing the narrative weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is stable with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of her craft) lands effectively. The reliance on summarized backstory to establish the stakes (the three messages, the fire) reduces the immediacy of the on-page narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.5)
    Orientation debt is high due to the unkept "search party" setup; the plot follows a linear path of procedural success with no setbacks, setbacks, or felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear Accumulative path that orients the reader well, but the causal linkage is soft; the protagonist visits a location and is handed the answer to her internal conflict. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of resistance or complication makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from disorientation to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose. The specific mechanic of "rewriting" the equations via the soil is causally soft—leaning on lyrical logic rather than established system rules—but the emotional closure is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on convenience; Mira walks directly to the correct stall, and the vendor immediately recognizes her ability and provides the object. The revelation that her grandmother pre-arranged the discovery removes the need for active problem-solving or agency, reducing the narrative engine to a series of fortuitous events rather than causal actions.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is coherent and the orientation is solid, but the structure is strictly linear with no obstacles. The story functions as a simple transaction: ghost appears, requests help, protagonist agrees. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (shifting from repair to remembrance), but the lack of causal complications makes the journey feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and decisive, moving efficiently from the frost's inciting warning to the climatic rupture. The closure is a text-book Decisive Change that fundamentally alters the status quo with tangible consequences (the library descending and breaking). The causal chain between the frost, the bottle, and the press is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from hypothesis to test to execution, with the "baroque sails" theory providing a satisfying logic for the climax. The closure is decisive, though the mechanism of the shard acting as a key relies on sudden intuition rather than a previously established rule of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Orientation is excellent, anchoring the reader immediately. The narrative arc is clear with a defined goal, inciting incident, and decisive change at the climax. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, with the dispersal of the light serving as a functional and conceptual resolution to the "repair" paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative drive to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the climax relies on a soft causal leap where scent acts as a magical "key" to the compass, dissolving the established rules of psychometry rather than utilizing them to solve the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience—the storm subsides immediately upon her epiphany (pathetic fallacy)—undercutting causal agency. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains abstract purpose without paying a visible price or making a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative operates as a summary or synopsis spanning weeks and seasons rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. The central epiphany arrives via a convenient external mechanism (the glass layers) rather than earned action. Closure is a montage of future success ("Visitors came... Mira returned") which dissipates tension rather than crystallizing a moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.0)
    The causal chain is clear, but the narrative lacks present-tense friction; obstacles are bypassed via backstory favors or environmental decay (rusted fence). The climax is a cooperative meeting that offers no resistance, reducing the narrative drive to a linear errand.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality breaks at the resolution when villagers instantly "felt" the non-magical light from afar, contradicting the established grounded tone. The conflict—a population fleeing a curse—is resolved by a convenient, unearned telepathic signal rather than character interaction or distinct consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, but the pivotal turn relies on an external coincidence (apples falling in coordinate patterns) rather than protagonist agency. The "apple coordinates" mechanic feels like a contrived puzzle solution that resolves the tension without internal cost. Orientation and pacing are otherwise steady.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure, where the ice is recontextualized from prison to preservation. However, the "risk of dissolution" is introduced and resolved without narrative friction, resulting in a flat causal arc lacking necessary turns or setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the situational drive leads to a clear "Zero Hour" climax, fulfilling the prompt's requirements. However, the closure relies on explicit explanation ("Mira understood then...") rather than dramatized realization, and the causality is driven by atmospheric inevitability rather than character action. The ending lands as a prepared sermon rather than an earned narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece functions as a legible vignette with stable orientation, but the lack of immediate pressure makes the closure feel like a restatement of the status quo rather than a decisive turn. The Earned Stasis is valid, but the absence of a specific constraint or test today lowers the dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene structure is solid, moving cleanly from orientation to encounter to resolution under an Accumulative lens. The closure serves as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (reaffirming her burden), though the linear progression lacks a sharp twist or deepening of the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration of her life's purpose) is earned by the scene. However, the pivotal climax relies on a convenient epiphany—Vera intuits complex encoded coordinates instantly ("Vera understood now")—which bypasses the dramatization of the deduction process.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves closure through Conceptual Repricing (revaluing the broken kite), but the trajectory is low-tension. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by overcoming significant obstacles or paying a hard price.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on broad summary spanning months rather than a specific, high-pressure scene, reducing immediacy. This violation of the short-story scope default (summary vs. scene) dilutes the inciting incident and prevents a sharp, dramatized climax.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "realization ex machina" where the protagonist suddenly intuits the aliens' exact complex motivation by looking at a piece of amber. This leap bypasses causal logic and lowers the narrative cost of the ending. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, but without a felt price paid for the certainty, it feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a powerful Earned Stasis, cementing Erasmus’s role in a cycle of "generous decay" and resurrection. The ending effectively reprices the concept of death, transforming the reef’s destruction into a resource, with the cost (Erasmus's own mortality) clearly articulated in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and the causality from riddle to resolution holds firm under the lens. The immediate solution to the riddle ("Marta's breath caught... The compost pit") removes potential tension in the middle beat, making the progression feel slightly linear.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is complete, with a clear incident (ship arrival) and a resonant closure (choosing to sketch). However, the internal logic of the time dilation creates a significant causality gap: the text claims "seconds here equaled hours below" (making the outside world fast) but describes the ship and stars moving "impossibly slow." This contradiction confuses the urgency of the ship's approach and the stakes of her timing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is coherent, but the closure lacks the required "visible or felt cost." The revelation that the theft was a pre-arranged test retroactively lowers the stakes, resulting in a tidy, cost-free resolution that fails the rubric's closure requirement for weight.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is flawless, using the daily walking ritual to build pressure that releases through the tactile placement of the pawns. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands on the page with visible cost (abandoning her livelihood) and tangible change (the restored board).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mosaic structure effectively spans time while maintaining a cohesive narrative arc, fitting the fable-like quality. The shift from nightly summary to the specific breakthrough with the feather provides necessary grounding. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of her state ("whole enough to hurt"), though the summary nature distances the reader from immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean and the causality—linking the village's suspended state to Marcus's internal stasis—is effective. The closure is distinct, utilizing a Decisive Change (unfreezing time) that resonates with the protagonist's release, though the mechanism of the tapestry decoding feels somewhat effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from setup to execution with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The logic of the "acoustic hacking" is established early, making the resolution feel earned rather than magical. The ending reconfigures the nature of the bone towers, offering a satisfying conceptual shift that aligns with the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the inciting pressure of the rising sea to the climax of the final transmutation. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the workshop and Vera's outlook. However, the resolution relies on a somewhat convenient magical effect (keys melting into structural gold) that solves the external threat a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure is resonant, with the "fragmentation" realization landing a solid Conceptual Repricing of his grief. However, the plot relies heavily on a convenient "wrong turn" to deliver the protagonist to a perfect, magical setting (the cave), which undercuts the causal chain of the middle build.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands clearly, but the progression is low-friction; the boy’s acceptance of his new role feels immediate and inevitable. The lack of a moment of doubt or visible cost before the resolution softens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situational lens, escalating from the inciting failure to the completion of the array. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis, with the protagonist accepting her role in a time-loop logic that feels earned within the story's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving from the inciting incident (arrival of the relic) to a decisive closure without wasted motion. The causality is ironclad; the protagonist's knowledge enables the action, and the action forces a permanent change in status. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration of her goals, turning her survival mechanism into a distribution network.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the "observing gaps" mechanism to bridge the physical investigation and the supernatural climax effectively. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the protagonist's status quo with clear intent, though the alignment of dates feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is strong, utilizing the rising water as an effective ticking clock to pressure the climax. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (abandoning the shop), and while the mechanics of the map’s return are elliptical, the resolution lands with thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a strong "Charged Poise" closure, with the Queen's resolve crystallizing into a clear plan of action. The inciting incident and rising action are well-paced, though the "sign" (fireflies) functions as a somewhat mechanical situational trigger to unlock the memory. The causal link between the fireflies and the specific memory of the murder is tenuous but serviceable.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) anchored by the transfer of the shell. The pacing is effective, and the orientation within the nexus is handled well without debt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story functions well as a situational shard with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The pivot to "writing toward" the ending provides a legible shift in stance, though the heavy reliance on backstory (finding the grave) lowers immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and the orientation is solid, effectively establishing the "healing service" structure. However, the progression is linear and lacks causal complexity; the resolution is achieved without a significant pivot or moment of doubt that would deepen the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a climax that resolves the immediate threat. However, the penultimate paragraph ("She would explain... She would write...") intellectualizes the victory with a future-tense summary, slightly diluting the immediacy of the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear inciting incident and closure. However, the climax is mechanically convenient—turning on a generator resolves the conflict without a tactical shift or deepening of the crisis. The logic of the orchard as an anchor is slightly fuzzy but serves as a functional ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic path (enter, read, transform) with adequate orientation but lacks causal tension or the risk of failure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (end becomes beginning), which is legible, but the lack of resistance prior to this moment makes the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from the inciting ritual to the surreal closure, effectively utilizing the internal logic of the "razor edges." However, the mechanics of the countdown feel somewhat arbitrary in setup, and the seamless progression from observation to departure lacks a complication that would test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving efficiently from setup to investigation to realization. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist commits to a new, cost-laden path (engaging with the brother's messy life) rather than retreating. The pacing aligns perfectly with the length, allowing the central metaphor to mature before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative relies heavily on backstory/flashback to the subway project to generate momentum, making the present action static. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the father's legacy, though the causal path (coordinates leading back to the library) is convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the mother’s grief. However, the pivot—the mother’s rapid acceptance of Vera’s reframing—feels slightly rushed and convenient, lacking the friction usually required to earn such a profound shift.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on a backstory recall (finding the 300 letters) to drive the plot, leaving the present-time scene as a low-stakes transaction. While the closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of causal friction or an active turning point in the present moment makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The plot pivots beautifully on the revelation that the courier was the intended target of the favor network, creating strong retroactive cohesion. Closure is a Decisive Change with clear conceptual cost: surrendering her "elusive" freedom for the "gentle chains" of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a professional commission to an existential crisis with a clean causal chain. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist achieves the goal (the stillpoint) and actively rejects it, reweighting her values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative executes a complex time-loop concept with admirable clarity; the inciting incident (the message arrival) and the climax (the correction) are distinct and causally linked via the established logic of the anomaly. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the "unbending" offering a satisfying mechanism for the resolution. The ending creates a legible "after" state for the universe and the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality holds, but the pivotal "teaching" beat is handled via summary montage ("Through the night, they worked...") rather than a dramatized scene. This softens the pacing and elides the mechanism of change, leaving the resolution feeling slightly unearned despite the logical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on an "explain-everything" letter to resolve the central mystery, bypassing active deduction. The core logic of the reveal (identical faces maintained across millennia via "bloodline" rather than cloning) strains suspension of disbelief without establishing genre rules, making the causality feel magical rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc where the protagonist's active choice (drumming) drives the climax and resolution. The closure is distinct: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the burden of memory is externalized into the setting, leaving a felt cost (loneliness) and a changed status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean linear path with a clever central puzzle solution (the key as a folding template). However, the resolution offers symmetric satisfaction without a distinct "felt cost" or complication; the journey from the solve to the goal is physically unopposed, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the boy stepping back) is earned by the interaction. However, the mechanism of resolution—the boathouse shutters projecting complex geometric "constellations" and "nautiluses" onto water—strains physical causality and verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving linearly from arrival to preparation to departure, and the closure (leaving the chess set) works as a "Resonant Reconfiguration." However, the scene functions primarily as a prologue to off-page action rather than a dramatic event in itself. The lack of causal obstacles—she simply enters, works, and leaves—flattens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal arc is strong, moving efficiently from the inciting realization to the decisive plunge. The "Treaty of Still Waters" backstory provides necessary context but arrives as a slight expository block; however, closure is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational Drive Lens, accumulating pressure through the mundane tasks under surveillance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where she solidifies her "remade hush" as a survival tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of uncomplicated success: arrival, affirmation, and ritual completion without causal setbacks. The closure—a magical light show and cracking ice—validates the premise but lacks a visible or felt cost, reading more as a foregone conclusion than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is flawless; the trade mechanic establishes a clear before/after state with a visible, paid cost (the reed and her "familiar darkness"). Closure is definitive and lands with a resonant reconfiguration of her artistic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure effectively supports the "artificial pilgrimage" concept, guiding the reader clearly through the stations. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist redefines connection, though the "tour of exhibits" pacing feels slightly mechanical and the final transition is smooth rather than pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure relies on a months-long montage ("The first... The second... Now she lived") rather than a focused scene, violating the scope defaults for this length. This summary mode dilutes the causal pressure, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned under immediate stress.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative path, gathering behavioral data until the client's vulnerability forces a Conceptual Repricing of the reading's purpose. Closure is achieved through the client's tangible shift from the Emperor (control) to the Moon (illusion), effectively dramatizing the surrender of his myth.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a coherent causal path, and the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist is irrevocably changed. However, the climax is summarized ("purification took hours or seconds") rather than dramatized, and the solution (acting randomly) feels like an abstract key that unlocks the problem without sufficient on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from observation to investigation (comparison) to resolution. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a validated cost (the loss of the heirloom), though the "comparison screen" functions as a convenient expository device to deliver the pivotal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scene functions well as a quiet "aftermath" beat, anchoring the internal shift in the physical repair of the cage. However, the inciting incident (the call) and the major resolution (reporting him) happen off-stage or in the future, leaving the present moment with low causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the ending offers genuine closure through the departure and hourglass shift. However, Mira walking, talking, and planning an escape only forty minutes after temporal lobe surgery strains medical credibility, creating a distraction from the otherwise strong fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory details to a resonant Conceptual Repricing (storage vs. planting). The closure is legible and conceptually earned, though the progression is smooth and linear, missing the sharp causal turns or high-stakes tightening that would elevate the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the pivotal moment relies on a convenient epiphany ("suddenly she understood") rather than active deduction. The resolution—turning a dial—solves a centuries-old problem with minimal friction, and the closure lacks a distinct, paid price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a linear problem-solution structure, but the resolution relies on a low-cost application of established skills ("whispering equations") rather than a hard-won victory. While the closure is legible (the child is saved), the lack of resistance from the world or the anomaly makes the causality feel convenient and the cost (dimming flowers) negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is clean, moving efficiently from orientation to closure with a validated drive lens (Causal). The climax, however, relies on a significant convenience—the found gear fitting the alien machine's aperture perfectly ("remained true")—which resolves the central problem too neatly for this level of realism.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative structure is a linear procession without causal friction; obstacles are removed by the guides rather than overcome by the protagonist. The ending fails the closure test because the "reclaiming" of courage incurs no felt price—the guide explicitly absolves her of guilt, turning the resolution into a gift rather than an earned change. The accumulation of regrets does not force a hard trade-off, leading to a frictionless resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight, leading to a high-quality closure unit where a physical action (turning the bolt) creates a Decisive Change with undeniable cost. The logic of the first message—letters pressed into dust by a footstep—is physically tenuous (implying a stamp on the sole or unnatural dexterity), but the causal chain holds firm.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from discovery to resolution, and the "rune of drift" introduces a functional magic system. Closure lands with a completed task and a paid resource cost (the last ink pellet), satisfying the rubric's requirement. However, the resolution feels slightly procedural—a "clean win" where the antagonist offers no direct pushback, reducing the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from assembly to realization to transmission. The backstory (finding the journals) is seamlessly integrated as the catalyst for the present moment's epiphany without stalling momentum. Closure is a definitive Decisive Change that reconfigures the world's understanding of the bleaching events.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a "magical realization" beat where the environment solves the protagonist's problem, bypassing agency. While the accumulation of sensory details builds a mood, the closure lacks a causal link to the protagonist's efforts or a legible price paid for the shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative arc relies on a significant off-page coincidence (the kite discovery) to solve the central mystery. The climax lacks causal friction; the obstacle (volcanic glass) shatters instantly without requiring ingenuity or cost from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    A clean Situational arc that utilizes Earned Stasis effectively; Mariam maintains her equilibrium against a specific trigger. The hawk incident provides a necessary pressure spike, and the return to the seedlings offers a legible, grounded closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story functions well as a fable with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The "walls closing in" provides effective structural pressure, though the resolution—pulling a thread to reveal the thematic answer—feels slightly convenient and reliant on dream logic rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clear investigative arc with an Accumulative drive, gathering evidence to pivot tactics at the end (hunting the scribes). The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her goal. However, the scene lacks immediate causal pressure; she observes a phenomenon without facing active opposition or a difficult on-page choice, resulting in a linear, low-stakes vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent linear structure with a clear decisive change at the climax. However, the timing of the antagonist's arrival coincides too perfectly with the protagonist's hesitation, feeling stage-managed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and follows a solid situational drive lens, moving from established stasis to a pressure test (soldier) to affirmed stance. The reflection on the father is substantial but successfully anchored to the sandbag prop, avoiding "floating" backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and tight, with the "Unraveling" providing a strong background clock that converges elegantly with the daughter's motivation. Closure is decisive (Resonant Reconfiguration); the daughter's message recontextualizes the tragedy, and Maren's final decision is a legible logical consequence of that new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is sturdy, and the closure—a decision to curate the truth—lands with clear conceptual cost. However, the coincidence of the asteroid arriving "tomorrow" after forty years is a heavy narrative convenience that strains credibility for a literary tone, acting as a forced accelerant rather than an organic complication.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from discovery to ritual to resolution. The mechanics of the "fold" and the "amber" are established early, making the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration—feel earned and logical within the story's physics. The ambiguity of the physical result paired with emotional certainty works well.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from setup to complication (the old man/the warning) to a resonant closure (Conceptual Repricing of the silence). The pacing works well for the length, and the "unlearning" frame is taught efficiently. The transition from fear to epiphany is earned through the ritual of the mandala.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure works well, moving from a general sensory memory (tessera) to a specific historical recovery (stepping stone). Closure is distinct and acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the space, though the transition between discovering the stone and knowing exactly where to look feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing (trading applause for private aid), but the progression is strictly linear. The absence of complications or setbacks makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain from testing the ability to finding the journal is logical, though the discovery of the hidden panel relies on a convenient proximity beat. The closure—a decisive commitment to the search—lands with emotional weight, though the brevity of the search phase limits the accumulation of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure of discovery without causal complications or twists. The ending lacks true closure; it offers a promise of future action ("Vera would bring them this gift") rather than a decisive change or reconfiguration with felt cost in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on a convenient "birthmark matching the constellation" trope to resolve the central riddle, short-circuiting earned causality. The climax is delivered via an exposition dump from the jar rather than protagonist agency, resulting in a low-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a decisive closure event (taking the files, refusing forgiveness) that reconfigures the protagonist's future. The central mechanism—snow melting into a cipher over three weeks—strains plausibility (weather variance would likely destroy such precision), but the story sells it well enough as genre poetry. The transition between the bluff and the sanatorium is efficient and maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing the "ticking gutters" as an effective pacing mechanism that creates tension without forced melodrama. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the needle shifts from a shroud-tool to an instrument of truth. The progression is steady, though the resolution relies more on the external clock (gutters stopping) than a protagonist-driven shift in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magical database" moment ("Then she understood") to resolve the central mystery, which shortcuts dramatic discovery. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where she aligns her craft with the oasis—lands with a clear sense of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving from the inciting loss (the fallen petal) to a resonant closure (the decision to replant). The pacing is controlled, allowing the small gesture of the reflected light to carry appropriate weight as a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (creating new life) is a decisive change, but the causal path is low-resistance; the ritual works instantly without complication. The connection between the "time is a door" advice and the birthing of winged creatures operates on dream logic rather than established causality, slightly weakening the resolution's earn.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving efficiently from the inciting dissatisfaction to the external catalyst (the spheres) and the resolving action. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where she adopts a new philosophy while retaining the old anchor (the twig)—lands with conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The countdown creates effective structural pressure, but the resolution relies on a "magic switch" mechanic where the device works instantly without on-page complication. The cost—a subtle disassociation from humanity in the final reflection—is alluded to but lacks visceral weight relative to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on video-game logic that strains literary credibility, specifically the "impossibly preserved" organ functioning perfectly in exposed ruins to open a stone door. While the cause-and-effect chain is clear, the reliance on such a convenient, unexplained mechanism weakens the sense of grounded reality essential for high-stakes exploration. The closure is tidy but lacks a significant complication or cost beyond transient fear.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The investigation follows a tight causal chain, leading to a satisfying Conceptual Repricing where "justice" is reconfigured as "witness." The deductive leap regarding the unified face is swift but plausible within the established logic of Clara's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where skepticism dissolves immediately upon the presentation of evidence. Closure is achieved through a "fix-it" resolution that lacks the required felt or conceptual cost; the victory is total and unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear, utilizing a hybrid lens where magical logic drives a decisive change at closure. The causality is functional, though the appearance of a fully equipped cabin removes the logistical friction of the decision, leaning heavily on the "magical gift" trope rather than earned discovery. The ending successfully executes a physical departure that cements the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mosaic structure effectively covers the multi-year span without losing coherence. The transitions are legible, and the pivot from the startup’s collapse back to the train feels earned. Closure is distinct, utilizing the Resonant Reconfiguration of the currency and stones to cement the relationship change.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative lacks causal friction; the central puzzle is solved via summary ("The correspondence was undeniable") rather than dramatized struggle. The climax arrives without a setback or cost, making the resolution feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting move and a logical use of the seed tool to bridge the obstacle. However, the resolution relies on a "naming the truth" trope that feels convenient, and the significant cost (trading years of life) is paid off-page in backstory rather than creating immediate pressure in the scene. The closure is legible, but the lack of an on-page trade-off softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is clean, moving from the inciting convergence to the ritual closure. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts her rootedness—lands with conceptual clarity. The lack of external obstacles makes the progression feel linear and low-risk, but the internal logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is sound with a clear descent, confrontation, and return. The closure unit (Decisive Change) lands effectively with a legible conceptual cost. The narrative arc follows a standard quest pattern but executes the causal links cleanly without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a potent image. The coincidence of Val entering exactly when the cloth is found—and having the perfect personal connection to it—feels slightly contrived, smoothing the plot path too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and leads to a Decisive Change (staying to translate), but the progression is linear and lacks obstacles. The magical "instant growth" of the tree resolves the central quest too conveniently, bypassing the potential struggle of the process and reducing the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, effectively using the fisherman's arrival to trigger a moment of reflection and reaffirmation (Earned Stasis). The pacing fits the contemplative mood, though the lack of external pressure limits the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is solid, but the resolution arrives via an immediate, perfectly reciprocated text message that mirrors her exact metaphor. This convenience dissolves the tension too cheaply, lowering the felt cost of her vulnerability. Orientation and closure form are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting withdrawal of medication to a resonant reconfiguration of her goal. However, the pivot relies on a convenient interpretation of graffiti that resolves deep trauma somewhat too tidily, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight, with the mechanics of the watch and library governing the progression from mystery to resolution. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands well, marked by the watch changing direction, which physically manifests the internal shift. The exposition regarding "propagation delays" is handled efficiently, serving as the key to the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from the pressure of the fading promise to the coffee-stain revelation and the final act. Closure is decisive (Resonant Reconfiguration) with the destruction of the violin effectively reweighting the stakes from possession to propagation.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution arrives with minimal resistance, creating a linear "win" rather than a complex reconfiguration. The closure relies on an explanatory summary of the character's realization rather than dramatizing the shift through action or image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and complete, effectively utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira reframes her understanding of contentment. The transition from Theron's specific scallop memory to Mira's total epiphany about her mother feels slightly rushed causality-wise, relying on thematic drift rather than strict narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean, with the "hollow mirror" interpretation serving as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts the client's perspective. The pacing is effective for the length, though the resolution comes relatively easily; the causal chain relies on the Keeper's wisdom unlocking the problem without a moment where the method risks failure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from setup to the lesson to a conceptual realization (erasure as collision/interference). The closure lands a successful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the method of vanishing is redefined as a tool for presence. The structure relies heavily on the master explaining the magic system, but it serves the closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure (wait, observe, call, arrival) that establishes a clear situational lens but lacks causal tension. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the student's arrival and the command to "stop climbing"—but the ease of the resolution limits the sense of earned cost or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clean Causal arc with a valid Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The resolution to the stairwell obstacle feels convenient—a remembered technique that works perfectly on the first try—which softens the rising action. The ending lands firmly, though the physical stakes of the climb dissipate rapidly once the mist walking is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from descent to discovery to realization. The "air pocket that defied every law" is a convenient premise setup rather than a causal development, but it serves the magical realism frame. Closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of Marcus's perception, though the lack of external obstacles flattens the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc toward a resonant closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where dissolution is accepted as transformation. The "coins landing on edge" provides a distinct, if slightly tropey, decisive moment that confirms the premise, though the reliance on expository setup in the first half slows the initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent, but the climax relies on a soft magic system ("strange alchemy") to resolve the central conflict. The resolution comes too easily, lacking a causal snap or a difficult trade-off that would earn the emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and the "fable" logic holds together well, moving efficiently from the inciting lack of flow to the ritual's success. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; the transition from "impossible execution" to success relies on a smooth application of will without a tangible, complication-driven twist or setback in the scene. The closure is resonant, but the causality is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.5)
    A fatal verisimilitude flaw undermines the plot: unsealed paper photographs cannot survive thirty-seven years submerged in a reservoir to be found intact in ticket windows or open albums. This logic break forces the investigation to function like a video game rather than realistic drama.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative is a linear ritual sequence that functions mechanically but lacks causal grit; the resolution is smooth and inevitable. While the transformation (closure) is legible, the explicit negation of cost ("she did not grieve") removes the necessary friction for a higher score, making the outcome feel like a "win-win" without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The arc is clean and the closure—choosing uncertainty over false comfort—is conceptually strong. However, the resolution feels slightly unearned; Commander Ash’s immediate validation ("You were right") mitigates the social cost of the false alarm too easily, softening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and relies on authority for resolution; the conflict dissolves upon Kira's command rather than through protagonist struggle or clever maneuvering. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, it feels unearned by the clones' prior resistance. The "Master solves it" beat lowers narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative structure is tight, with a clear inciting incident (the seed) leading directly to a Conceptual Repricing of the antagonist's offer. The closure is effective, recontextualizing the seed's biology into a business strategy, though the conflict resolution feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative traces a clear Causal/Situational line: entry, ritual, maceration, and a decisive shift in stance at closure. The ending (humming instead of apologizing) serves as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, rejecting a tidy fix for a messier, more honest connection. Orientation is handled efficiently within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is solid and the arc is legible under a Causal/Situational lens. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, though the transition from isolation to connection feels slightly rushed and lacking in resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is strong, weaving backstory effectively into the ritual action. Closure lands as a solid Charged Poise, though the cost ("remaining life-essence") is stated rather than viscerally felt in the walk-away.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is solid, with the technical pivot (discarding assumptions) directly enabling the resolution and closure. Orientation is immediate and effective, though the star fragment's sudden physical warmth sits awkwardly against the story's established respect for mechanical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.7)
    The closure lands effectively with a legible cost, but the causal chain relies on an unearned epiphany: Mara "suddenly understands" the hourglass's true function after years of ignorance just when the plot requires it. This intuitive leap bypasses the necessary trial-and-error or established logic required for a tighter causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is flawless, operating under a clear Situational/Causal hybrid lens where the gallery's mechanics force a specific resolution. The closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the tangible cost of a "smaller" reality and the acceptance of strain, satisfying the logic established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is remarkably clean, adhering perfectly to the single-scene scope with a clear Accumulative lens. The closure is excellent: leaving the chain link is a decisive, resonant action (Conceptual Repricing) that physically manifests her shift in worldview. The orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the problem (grief) is resolved immediately by the protagonist's arrival and the magical device's perfect function. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending with no visible cost or trade-off; everything resolves neatly without complicating the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The linear descent-ascent structure is tightly executed with clear orientation and a legible clock. The closure—writing the names while the new cables hum—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands effectively, paying off the witnessing drive with a concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration (heartbeats turning to music). However, the causal bridge between the "digital infrastructure" premise and the mystical "ink divination" resolution is fragile, relying on a genre shift that feels unearned by the story's established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.5)
    The pivot relies on a realization shortcut ("suddenly she understood") rather than earned causality. The resolution is mechanically smooth but lacks narrative friction, as the protagonist's veins negate the diamond's curse without a dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, with the discovery of the arrowhead naturally triggering the climax under a Causal/Hybrid lens. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of Maren's worldview, actively rejecting the "cosmic joke" for a path of wonder, though the phone's activation timing is a convenient coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear inciting incident and climax. Causality holds mostly, as the "silent percussion" loophole is established early. However, the resolution—where the entire repressive system crumbles instantly due to "resonance"—feels like a scale violation for a short story; the "magic fix" ending resolves the conflict too cleanly without a proportional on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear path to a legible moment of Earned Stasis, with the exchange providing a clear before/after state. However, the lack of an active obstacle or reversal within the scene results in a low-pressure vignette rather than a tightened plot.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence: discovering his own grandfather's specific recording in a random abandoned train in the desert. This Deus Ex Machina resolves the central conflict through luck rather than agency, severing the causal chain expected in high-end literary fiction. The closure feels unearned because the catalyst was provided by fate, not forged by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a clear Situation/Accumulation lens, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of the scarf as a map. However, the inciting incident relies on coincidence ("On this particular night") rather than causal pressure, and the transition into the fantastical space feels somewhat automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the ending shifts abruptly into a generalized summary ("She continued... The odd-hour librarian still keeps...") which dilutes the immediate impact of the closure unit. The climax relies slightly on the coincidental timing of the sun breaking the fog.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    The resolution relies on a causal gap where "improbable longing" allows the protagonist to simply "rewrite the mechanism." This soft-magic leap bypasses the established premise of locksmithing skill; the problem is solved by emotional assertion rather than a logical application of the established toolset, weakening the closure's earned feel.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative suffers from a central causal contradiction: Elara explicitly states the method had "vanished from memory like everything else," yet she successfully uses it to locate the jar. This logical loop undermines the procedural satisfaction of the recovery. However, the closure lands well, reconfiguring the initial stake (loss) into a new, vigilant stance ("gathering memories like mushrooms") with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    A flawless causal arc that effectively utilizes the single-scene window. The inciting reflection moves naturally through external pressure (Thessaly) to a Decisive Change with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates as a fable-like summary spanning forty years rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure, violating the short-story scope default. The pacing is linear and expository ("Marek noticed... Then... Day after day..."), preventing the accumulation of visceral tension or high-stakes causality on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the physical action of unraveling to the metaphysical release. Closure is distinct (Resonant Reconfiguration), though the internal pivot that drives the final decision is slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, gathering evidence until the pressure forces a stance crystallization. The closure—writing the report while the chapel wakes—lands with a distinct resonant reconfiguration of the threat. The pacing perfectly matches the "slow erosion" motif established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is functional and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, but the narrative relies on significant convenience. Finding a snow globe (invented c. 1900) in an 1847 shipwreck disrupts historical logic, and its survival at depth strains the "physics" motif Eleanor obsesses over. The causality is linear but lacks resistance; the discovery yields the thematic epiphany instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on expository backstory (paragraphs 3-5, 8) to establish the premise, stalling the immediate scene's momentum. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "magic success" resolution lacks a felt cost paid in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    The elevator ascent provides a functional linear structure that paces the reveal of information well. However, causality relies heavily on the diary acting as a *deus ex machina* instruction manual that dissolves the central problem without requiring the protagonist to innovate. Closure is achieved, but the resolution—Vesper immediately accepting the release—feels unearned and lacks a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative arc, building atmospheric pressure effectively. However, the closure relies on an explanatory summary of the realization ("Wholeness was not about...") rather than a dramatized reconfiguration of the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc from discovery to creation under pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "map on the coin" feels convenient, lacking a dramatized struggle to decode it that would have heightened the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on a significant unearned coincidence: the random engine failure leaves the ship exactly above the secret coordinates found on the board. The closure is a "win" achieved through summary ("By dawn, Elara had filled thirty pages") rather than a dramatized climax with visible cost. Causality is weakened by the convenient convergence of the drift and the map.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (clock ticking) lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, causality is weakened by the convenience of the prophecy, which explicitly instructs Mira on the theme and solution, reducing her agency in the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure with no meaningful obstacles; the ghost provides the answer, and the characters simply obey. Closure is an example of "symmetric satisfaction" where everyone receives validation without cost or sacrifice. The ending conversation resolves the emotional distance too easily, lacking the requisite "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and tightly structured, moving from the setup of the clock to a resonant closure. The inward ignition of the beam serves as a strong Conceptual Repricing, shifting the lighthouse's function from warning to comfort with clear signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, with the "blueprint" backstory effectively justifying Maren's tactics without stalling momentum. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the restoration of the birds' function mirrors Maren's acceptance of her role. The pacing creates a genuine sense of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal link between the ravine insight and the lab work is strong and structural. However, the three-month time jump skips the crucial trial-and-error phase, reducing the felt cost of the resolution and relying on summary to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path (setup, arrival, realization) but lacks a distinct turning point where options narrow or costs are paid. The closure relies on a summarized epiphany ("finally understanding that...") rather than a dramatized reconfiguration of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient and structurally sound, moving from inciting desire to a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's life. The transition into the cavern ("suddenly she was descending") reads slightly passive compared to the precision of the rest of the plot, but the closure—a deliberate touch that validates the internal change—lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path—setup, broadcast, success—without causal complications, setbacks, or a distinct inciting pressure. While the closure lands a resonant image (Resonant Reconfiguration), the lack of an obstacle or palpable cost makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is functional but strictly linear: preparation, execution, success. There is no significant reversal or complication that threatens the outcome, resulting in a low-tension arc where the ending feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The countdown structure builds effective momentum, and the gravity inversion provides a visually distinct climax that pays off the setup. The backstory is well-anchored to the present action. Closure is solid, though the "threshold effects" function as a slightly convenient mechanic to resolve the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong causal arc from the failure of air-conduction to the discovery of the sculpture and the successful bone-conduction instrument. Closure is decisive, reconfiguring the world's limitations into a new possibility with a legible constraint (silence remains), though the physics logic is poetic rather than rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is linear and ritualistic: arrival, preparation, execution, departure. While the closure (renewing the covenant) is legible, the lack of obstacles or complications results in a low-tension progression. The "nexus revealed itself slowly" serves as a convenience that smooths over potential struggle rather than creating narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure (finding emptiness/peace instead of answers) lands with clarity. However, the causality is soft; the lock opens via a magical-realist mechanism that bypasses genuine tactical difficulty or physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is solid with a clear arrival, ordeal, and departure arc. The time compression ("Days passed") is handled efficiently, and the closure (Decisive Change) lands with a legible conceptual cost—trading the sanctuary for applied wisdom below.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure that resolves via a "talking head" exposition dump (the grandmother's ghost) rather than protagonist agency. The ending lacks a legible cost; Maren gains the solution without sacrifice, resulting in a low-impact resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative line—hypothesis, data collection, confirmation—resulting in a coherent but linear trajectory. The closure is a form of Charged Poise ("prepared to speak second"), which is effective, but the scene lacks a decisive turn or reversal; Mira confirms what she already suspects without facing a new, complicating obstacle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative traces a clear causal line to a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the protagonist re-evaluates her goal. Closure is solid, though the linear progression—observation, realization, execution—lacks a complication that would heighten the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is strong: need drives action, which yields revelation and recontextualizes the future (Conceptual Repricing). The single-scene structure effectively utilizes the flashback mechanism without breaking the present-moment tension. Closure is decisive, shifting the paradigm from harmony to discord, though the ease with which she enters and exits the trance slightly lowers the sense of structural risk.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to epiphany, but the pivotal turn relies on the external agency of the "pulsing" halo fragment and a convenient memory of a "forgotten lecture." The resolution lacks a decisive on-page choice or sacrifice; the mathematics simply "resolve" because the object activates.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story relies heavily on reflection (exceeding the ~30% guideline) to convey the central arc, rendering the present action a static frame for summary. While the "Conceptual Repricing" closure is valid, the structural weight of the backstory flattens the immediate narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and effectively Accumulative, building to a legible Conceptual Repricing closure where the premise is reweighted. While orientation and causality are strong, the progression is linear; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or setbacks during the scene, reducing narrative tension to a vignette-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the ritualistic structure leads to a legible Decisive Change closure. The causality of the puzzle-frame magic is inventive and established well, though the resolution feels slightly too neat in its execution.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, and the orientation in the opening is excellent. However, the resolution relies heavily on a summary montage spanning years ("It would take years... Settlers began returning"), which distances the reader from the immediate cost of the closure. The ending functions more as a fable's moral summary than a dramatized scene resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    The plot hinges on a convenient coincidence—the "cyclical surge" happening exactly when needed—and resolves via a vision that explains the backstory completely. While the final choice (entering the rift) provides closure, the mechanism of discovery is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is excellent; the rebuilding of the cairn with the sea glass functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration that conveys her decision visually. The plot mechanics of the stone language integrate perfectly with the inciting incident of the empty tower.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear vignette (climb, light, speak, descend) lacking a causal turn or decisive change. The drive lens is Accumulative, but without a disruption or intensification that reweights the stakes, the ending is merely a completed loop rather than Earned Stasis. There is no structural tension; the outcome is guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (deciding to stay) is a valid Decisive Change, but the progression relies heavily on expository dialogue. The causality is soft; the protagonist moves from question to answer with minimal friction or structural complication.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts rather than fixes the central burden. The Causal/Hybrid lens holds firmly, with the sextant's repair and reassembly logically driving the shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist is fundamentally altered and the world state changes with clear causality. The opening third is somewhat static and exposition-heavy, but the narrative drive tightens significantly once the interaction with the windows begins.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is functional and achieves a form of Conceptual Repricing at closure, but the turning point is driven by the secondary character's explanation rather than the protagonist's agency. The orientation is solid, but the resolution feels conceptually awarded rather than causally earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens works well here, gathering evidence of erasure before culminating in the ritual of planting. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where planting becomes a refusal to forget—lands with clear logic, though the "weight" of memory is told more than felt through active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly paced, moving efficiently from orientation to the inciting pressure of the collapsing star. The closure is excellent, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the destruction of the library is balanced by the preservation of a single, potent truth. The cause-and-effect linkage between the pressure (dying star) and the specific action (measuring/selecting) is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from high stakes to a decisive physical interception. However, the "false starts" are delivered via summary rather than dramatized pressure, which lowers the immediate tension, and the climax relies on a somewhat simple collision to resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure relies heavily on a "maid and butler" dynamic where arriving characters explain the plot and the brother's fate via dialogue rather than action. While the final realization (Resonant Reconfiguration) is conceptually strong, it feels unearned because the protagonist simply stands and listens to get there. The causality is external—figures arrive to tell her the truth—rather than driven by her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is legible and the closure is distinct, but the inciting incident (finding the letter) occurred "last month," weakening the causal urgency of the specific scene; the narrative relies on a delayed reaction rather than immediate pressure. The resolution feels like a victory lap rather than a problem solved in the moment, as the primary obstacle (the father) is already dead.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on convenience to advance the plot, bypassing potential conflict with phrases like "yielded to her prying" and "found the listening room easily enough." The six-hour journey through the tunnels is compressed into a single transition without complication, making the discovery feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is clean but strictly linear: arrival, diagnosis, construction, success. The resolution relies on the "magic" of the iceberg sculpture working perfectly on the first try without complication or cost. The closure is legible (fog clears), but the lack of a "try/fail" cycle reduces narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal lens. The repurposing of the "controlled burn escape" protocol provides a satisfying, character-rooted solution to the central problem. Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; the final action of burying the compressed grief physically demonstrates the internal shift with undeniable cost and permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from mystery to revelation to a resonant decision to wait (Charged Poise). The central device—the daughter randomly donating the specific coat with the key to Maren's shop—relies heavily on coincidence, even with the "subconscious desire to be found" explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no causal turns or obstacles that force a deviation in tactics. Closure is achieved through simple retrieval and a summarized realization, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration earned by the scene's events. The trajectory is flat: she arrives, succeeds, and leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on convenient plotting, specifically the coffee grounds providing explicit instructions ("exhumation") and the lack of security at the "sealed" chamber. The resolution hinges on a hidden key and a secret panel discovered at the exact moment of need, which feels like a retroactive patch rather than a causal payoff. While the inciting incident is strong, the bridge to the climax lacks resistance; obstacles dissolve upon approach.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the inciting threat to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy is transformed. The causality of the magic system is coherent within the story's logic, though the resolution feels slightly convenient given the "kingdom-crumbling" stakes established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mosaic structure effectively spans the timeline, and the cyclical closure (Conceptural Repricing of the sugar) lands with resonance. However, the pivotal climax of Voss's departure is narrated in summary rather than shown as a dramatized beat, reducing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure is decisive, but the mechanics of the resolution rely on a convenient "wireless" transmission that bypasses the established constraint of the paired shells. The final image of the "empty shell" creates a momentary ambiguity regarding the transmission's success versus the object's state.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story achieves a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure; the act of forgery paradoxically restores truth, and the crumbling key offers a definitive physical marker of the completed arc.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tight and unbroken; the protagonist's investigation leads directly to a reversal of worldview. Closure is excellent, landing a Decisive Change where the protagonist's mode of interaction shifts from song to silence, paying off the setup with a distinct, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is clean with a legible orientation and closure, but the pivotal discovery relies on a convenient psychic vision ("margins of Marcus's dream") rather than active investigation. The resolution feels inevitable, lacking the drag of genuine causal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean lyric structure (observation, test, confirmation, return) that supports the quiet tone. Closure lands as valid Earned Stasis, though the linear progression lacks a significant complication or reversal to heighten the narrative payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on a "convenient manual" device—reconstructing seven pages of shredded letters in a windbreak in three hours—to deliver the entire backstory and magic system in summary. This info-dump bypasses dramatized discovery, reducing the plot to reading instructions and retrieving an object, with no causal tightening or meaningful obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structural arc is legible, but the climax relies on a "talk-no-jutsu" resolution where a lifetime of conviction (Caro's) is overturned by a single broadcast. The causality feels thin; the ending is reached through easy persuasion rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central action—decoding the music box—occurs in summary ("Slowly, a story emerged") rather than as a dramatized scene with risk. The closure is a realization of work already completed off-page, lacking immediate stakes or a felt cost in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive with a strong, definitive closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) where Vera trades existence for release. The pacing is effective, utilizing the sunset as a ticking clock to pressure the climax. While the resolution of the external threat (mercenaries weeping) borders on convenient, the high personal cost to the protagonist anchors the ending successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is linear and convenient, with key developments (discovering the viaduct) occurring without struggle. Closure lands on a thematic reflection rather than a paid cost; the ending feels like a completed checklist rather than a dramatic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and functional, with a clear closure decision (leaking the files). However, the central setup—an antique Underground Railroad lantern left mounting the wall directly beside an active smuggling operation—strains plausibility and relies on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is functional, but the climax relies heavily on a pathetic fallacy (clouds parting exactly at the moment of realization) rather than causal necessity. The ending—a music box playing "somewhere"—is atmospherically resonant but creates a slight logical fuzziness regarding the timeline (Ruth said "come back in a week").

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving causally from the kaleidoscope's vision to the physical preparation and launch; the closure is a decisive change that fundamentally alters the protagonist's state and location.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story achieves closure with a Decisive Change (running), but the central turning point—accessing the sealed vault—relies on a convenient lie to security ("smiled brightly") that meets no resistance. This lack of obstacles undermines the plausibility of a high-security conspiracy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear but lacks causal tension; the conflict is resolved by a "magic fix" where a mentor figure explains and cures the problem immediately. Closure lands, but without a visible or felt cost—Kira receives healing without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece relies heavily on reflective summary ("She had not meant to stay... she had simply joined them") rather than a pressurized present-tense scene. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible, the lack of on-page events flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure via the "invoices" reveal. The inciting incident and climax are structurally sound, though the pacing feels somewhat linear and lacking in causal surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from arrival to resolution with a legible "Decisive Change" closure where the voices are saved at the cost of the physical pavilion. However, the "kinetic parapet" functions as a convenient found solution that resolves the central problem a bit too easily; the protagonist discovers the perfect tool waiting for her rather than forging a solution from scarce resources. This lowers the causal tension, though the pacing and structural integrity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies heavily on iterative summary ("Each week," "By autumn") rather than dramatized scene work, reading more like a synopsis than a contained short story. The lack of a specific, high-pressure moment means the resolution (healing) feels inevitable rather than earned through causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    A clear Accumulative arc leads to a solid Conceptual Repricing where the silence is recontextualized as dormancy. The pacing fits the contemplative mode, though the inciting incident (crystal falling) is distant backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Causal/Thematic Hybrid lens that lands a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the closure: the reframing of his curse as "mercy." The sequence of waking, arranging markers, writing, and realizing creates a solid structural spine, and the ending resonates with felt cost—the acceptance of inevitable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, moving cleanly from the presentation of the broken object to a resonant closure. The "magical realism" logic holds up well under the Causal/Thematic lens, and the ending delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's relationship to loss is fundamentally altered.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative structure is sound, with a clear situational drive leading to a "Charged Poise" closure that effectively prepares the characters for the incoming news. The pacing is smooth, though the linear progression offers few causal surprises or complications to the established trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal chain from the inciting incident to resolution, but the closure lacks a felt cost. The problem is solved through procedural success without a visible sacrifice, trade-off, or risk of failure, resulting in a "too neat" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving efficiently from the catalyst (tooth) to the climax (exhumation) without wasted motion. Closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist commits to a new paradigm with clear conceptual cost (abandoning her "carefully ordered life"). Orientation is established immediately and holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure ("arrive, polish, arrange, leave") lacking a distinct turning point or causal pressure. While orientation and closure are legible, the absence of an obstacle—internal or external—results in a "smooth ride" that fails to test the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative lens holds well; the convergence of the environmental detail (thaw patterns) and the sister's arrival leads to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure—an offering that recontextualizes the "trapped" moth—lands with earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Decisive Change) is legible. However, the logic of the "nexus" relies on convenient dream reasoning rather than established causal constraints. The episodic structure—visiting characters sequentially—feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear success path where the plan works exactly as calculated without unforeseen complications. While the closure (restoration of the vines) is clear, the lack of a deepening turn or a moment where the plan nearly fails makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure works well, building steady textural pressure through the assembly of the pattern. Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the aurora moves, the heart beats). The narrative is linear and successful without a significant complication or twist to test the protagonist's resolve in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and the Accumulative structure successfully builds to the release of the echoes, landing a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is logically sound, but the "felt cost" required for higher bands is somewhat abstract—asserted as "terrifying" rather than demonstrated through a distinct loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc where the weaving ritual successfully resolves the premise. While the closure (regaining her name) is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of unforeseen complications or a sharper cost makes the resolution feel slightly transactional.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, using the boiling kettle as a precise temporal frame to contain the reflection. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration; the realization that "this was enough" feels earned by the sensory work preceding it. The structure is tight and effective for this meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scene structure is solid, with a clear beginning, middle, and end that lands a Resonant Reconfiguration. The causality of the turning point is slightly weak; the resolution depends on a lucky "overheard fragment" from the past rather than a tactic generated by the immediate pressure of the ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative is linear and lacks resistance; the solution arrives via calculation rather than hard-won insight, and the closure, while clear, carries no legible felt or conceptual cost. The transition from "tracing dust" to a complete revival plan feels unearned by the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.6)
    The inciting incident occurs off-page ("last night"), leaving the narrative to function as a low-stakes reaction scene rather than unfolding action. Closure is legible as a Decisive Change, but the cost remains abstract and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative structure is functional and linear, but the tension is retrospective; the key deduction (radio silence) occurs off-page in backstory. The climax relies on a "discovery letter" to explain the plot and motivation, which deflates narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (a decision to leave) is clear, but the climax relies on a convenient discovery—the rope happens to contain an invitation/map—rather than an earned tactical victory. The transition from decoding fishing methods to finding a secret society test feels unearned by the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative lens, building emotional weight through the ritual of writing. However, the pivot from the opening hook (writing her own obituary) to the climax (writing Matthias's) lacks a causal connective step, reading more like a prompt redirection than a character-driven choice. Closure lands with a clear realization (Resonant Reconfiguration).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear, leading to a climax that effectively alters the story world (the mechanical birds glitching). The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing—the definition of success shifts from perfection to "flawed" life—though the mechanics of "Resonance Reconstruction" border on a magic wand.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story functions as a legible accumulative vignette, successfully anchoring the reader in time and place. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (reframing the fire), but the narrative lacks a present-moment pressure or obstacle to force this shift; the epiphany arrives largely because the scene ends.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and closure lands clearly, but agency is weakened by the "breadcrumb" device, which functions as a convenient rail rather than an active investigation. The solution relies on fable-logic that feels slightly disconnected from the established "realistic" constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.1)
    The resolution relies on a convenient causality break: a civilization defined by "fire" and "annihilation" inexplicably encoded a "light resonance" frequency into a mechanical gear. Closure lacks a visible price or trade-off; the solution is purely additive and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, following an accumulative logic that leads to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (the sketch and ribbon). Orientation is strong, though the plot lacks a sharp complication; the solution arrives smoothly through advice rather than trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving from the physical climb to the ritualistic release. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the past remains fixed but the protagonist's relationship to it shifts meaningfully. The backstory of finding the handle serves as a functional setup, though the logic of the "shared handle" requires a suspension of disbelief that fits the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a legible Conceptual Repricing of the cemetery, but the opening "chess clock" beat creates a false literal anchor that creates orientation debt when later revealed as metaphor. The resolution relies heavily on the coincidence that she already works at the target location.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from hesitation to execution within a single scene. The closure works well as a "Conceptual Repricing," reframing the map as an invitation rather than a command. Orientation is strong, though the transition from fear to steady confidence faces little resistance, reducing the sense of causal density.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The situational drive is clear, and the broadcast ritual provides a solid structural spine. The closure works as Earned Stasis, with Helena persisting despite the threat. The cutaways to "basements and barns" distract slightly from the immediate scene tension, diffusing the focus just as the patrol threat should be escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear ritual that moves efficiently from the inciting death to the acceptance of succession. While the closure (Earned Stasis) is resonant and legible, the plot lacks significant resistance or a complication that forces Marina to adapt her tactics; she executes the grandmother's instructions perfectly, which lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc (find, reflect, cache), and the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible. However, the lack of causal density gives it a vignette quality; the decision to hide the artifact feels inevitable rather than earned by overcoming resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration where the silence is redefined as a "rest." The structure is efficient, though the inciting incident (Darius's entry) leads to the resolution with very little resistance or complication, making the causal path feel somewhat linear and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is linear and relies on a convenient, frictionless climax where the seed grows instantly via "synaptic plasticity," removing the necessity of struggle or ingenuity. The ending provides a clear "after" state but lacks a decisive turn or felt sacrifice, reading more as a victory lap than a resolved conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with convenient causality (the "memory" banks perfectly solve the "navigation" failure via poetic rather than systemic logic). The resolution feels unearned, as the protagonist happens to possess the exact secret knowledge and tools required without needing to struggle for them.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the Conceptual Repricing at the end (shifting value from the object to the witness) provides valid closure. However, the turning point relies on a sudden, unprompted insight ("The house exhaled... and she understood") rather than a causal chain of events, which softens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational line, using the encounter to dismantle Mira's preconceptions. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands well, exchanging the diver's sharp grief for a more complex, ambiguous peace, though the convenience of the ampoule softens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, successfully utilizing the surreal logic of the setting to drive the climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift in the environment's temperature and the die's texture creates a legible "after" state without breaking the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative structure relies on a convenient coincidence—the laptop "ping" arriving exactly as the painting session concludes—to provide validation and closure. While the internal reconfiguration (insomnia as gift) is legible, it is triggered by an external Deus ex machina rather than protagonist agency or the pressure of the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear situational drive, moving from the inciting absence of the beekeeper to a resonant closing image. Orientation is immediate and grounding. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing the bread from mere food to sacred artifact, though the middle beat (the baking lesson) feels slightly low-pressure until the final recontextualization.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting discovery to the climactic departure. The closure (stepping out of time) is a distinct Decisive Change that logically follows the established premise of unwinding fate, though the mechanics of the yoyo itself rely slightly on "black box" convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure suffers significantly by separating the setup (the vivid funhouse scene) from the climax (a brief dream sequence at home). Relegating the central confrontation to a "that night" summary dissipates the tension built in the primary setting and renders the resolution a matter of execution rather than on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative lens, gathering sensory details toward a moment of affirmation (Earned Stasis). While the closure is legible, the narrative arc is flat; the inciting incident (wreckage arrival) meets no resistance, resulting in a scene of routine rather than a meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal Drive Lens, moving efficiently from the inciting realization to the departure. The closure—a physical crossing of the threshold—is a valid Decisive Change. The "crack in the gate" is a slightly convenient solution to the physical obstacle, but the psychological pressure sustains the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rosebush serving as a thematic and structural timer provides a compelling causal anchor for the inciting incident, effectively pacing the release. The closure is decisive and earned, with the data upload creating a legible "after" state that fundamentally alters the narrative world.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on a convenient coincidence—finding the exact photograph to match a letter found years ago in a different location—which undercuts the earned nature of the climax. While the closure (leaving the note) is conceptually coherent, the lack of causal pressure or obstacles makes the narrative arc feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is clean and the causal chain—blackout creating silence, silence enabling discovery—is logical. The pivotal discovery relies slightly on convenience (hearing a slipped manuscript), but the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the stamp) lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure lands on a "magic fix" that negates the loss without a visible cost; the text claims "luminous torment," but the outcome (peaceful sleep) contradicts this, creating incoherent causality. The resolution feels unearned because the protagonist succeeds completely without facing a difficult trade-off or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative drive, gathering weight through memory and calculation to land a Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The ending successfully reconfigures the geode from "smoke" to "unbearably real," anchoring the protagonist's abstract hunt in a heavy, physical cost. The narrative arc is tight and the orientation is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative is coherent and causally linked, fitting a "lock and key" structure where elements slot together perfectly. However, the resolution relies on convenience—the pilgrim arrives exactly when needed, and the machine works instantly—resulting in low felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is solid, anchoring backstory (the letter) to a present ritual with a clear Decisive Change at closure. While the finding of the watch hand is a coincidence, it functions well as a situational catalyst that forces the internal turn rather than externally solving the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.7)
    Structure is solid and the Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the "space between apology and forgiveness") lands effectively. The narrative is linear and lacks a sharp causal complication or twist; the exchange proceeds exactly as planned, which lowers the narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Situational drive lens holds well, moving from the launch to a quiet but distinct closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where she accepts her new, humbler method of navigation. The backstory is integrated without disrupting the present timeline, though the inciting incident (dropping the compass) relies on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    The resolution relies on a "late rule change" (algae acting as a mood ring) that simplifies the maze without prior setup or cost. The time-travel element serves as a deus ex machina to drive Elena's motivation, feeling disjointed from the memory-wipe premise and weakening causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving directly from the inciting preparation to the climactic ritual and its consequences. The closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist is irrevocably changed (becoming part beast/spirit) to achieve her goal. The logic of the magic system holds firm, and the "window" of the phoenix rise provides necessary urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and the "divination as archaeology" logic provides a sturdy causal framework for the magic. However, the ending descends into convenient symmetry with the grandmother waiting at the bottom, which feels slightly unearned and spatially convenient compared to the arduous climb.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal/Hybrid lens, moving from the collection of the tear to the specific confrontation with the self. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (opening the dimension) earned by a difficult internal admission, though the final sentence ("Now only light remained") tilts slightly toward abstract sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a strong sense of closure (Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing). However, the story is heavily front-loaded with exposition (paragraphs 1-7) before the active scene begins, which delays the momentum. The transition from the backstory "detour" to the present moment is functional but slightly reduces the immediacy of the inciting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is logical but lacks tension; the protagonist faces no active opposition or unexpected hurdles, turning the climax into a procedural execution of a perfect plan. While the closure (messengers departing) is legible, the lack of on-page resistance or near-failure robs the "inciting incident" of weight.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent, linking the loss of friction to Meren's specific skillset effectively. The resolution feels slightly precipitous; the "backward pattern" explanation is abstract, and the fix happens rapidly, but the closure is legible as a decisive shift from observer to actor.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scene is structurally sound, using the timer effectively to pace the narrative toward a clear closure unit. While the "vigil" provides a reason to wait, the delay in opening the envelope feels slightly performative—a ritual for the reader's benefit more than the character's urgent need. The closure (Decisive Change) is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative commits a critical error by summarizing the climax ("When it ended") rather than dramatizing the confrontation, robbing the story of its decisive moment. Additionally, the plot device—a secret society encoding their clandestine meeting coordinates on a permanent sundial in the embassy lobby—strains plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is solid, effectively anchoring the present moment in necessary backstory to establish the stakes. The closure lands as a clear Earned Stasis, reaffirming their commitment despite the danger. The flashback is slightly lengthy (~30%), slowing the present momentum, but the return to the present is clean and the orientation remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves complete closure, but it relies heavily on "prepared" conveniences (the pre-installed receiver, the film arriving today) that rob the present moment of risk. The resolution feels engineered by the husband's past actions rather than earned by the protagonist's present agency.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and ticking clock (monsoon) providing coherent structure. The resolution relies on a fugue-state action (planting while unconscious), which works for the tone but bypasses a conscious, agentic choice at the critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from arrival to resolution, but the closure relies on a magical convenient device (the lace code) that bypasses the difficulty of communication. The "Decisive Change" (reconciliation) lands softly without a visible "felt cost" for the protagonist; the solution is handed to her rather than earned.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from lever pull ("red light flickered") to sketching plans, delivering Charged Poise closure where bookmark pocketed reconfigures isolation into outreach with conceptual cost of solitude's end. Orientation anchored early; one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds perfectly through because/therefore chain (DNA → shell coordinates → library → photo reveal → confession); closure DC lands decisively in "confession spilling like rust... Marla recorded everything" with relational cost legible as Sandra crumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds via building darkness density to Charged Poise closure; map completion reconfigures void as navigable with conceptual cost in "last star exhaled its final gleam." Orientation anchors early; single scene fits scope seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density of observations tightens to resonant object exchange; closure Charged Poise reconfigures isolation with emotional cost in "giving away a piece of her carefully constructed distance."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as marble collection density builds to Elena's visit and maze revelation; closure via Conceptual Repricing (deception repriced as devotion) lands on-page with cost in "mended one" line, reconfiguring premise; orientation anchored by ~50 words, no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns build from mapped lattices to anomaly ripple, delivering Conceptual Repricing closure ("Time wasn't a river. It was an ocean") with legible conceptual cost in subdued awakening. Orientation anchors early (Mira, station, twilight); single scene causality traces setup to payoff without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds via rising water revealing stains/program/documents to a Charged Poise closure (nod, ghost softens, truth sealed/carried out) with legible cost in her lifelong marginality reconfigured; orientation instant, no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early—dust, scales, starlight as filtered residue—and holds to the final image of the blooming orchid, achieving a Charged Poise reconfiguration. Orientation is clean within 60 words; causality is internal and recursive rather than event-driven, fitting the lyric mode. Closure cost is implied—she accepts demolition and takes only one slide—but because the earlier “strip drama” goal never meets an opposing force that tests it, the change feels gentle, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative lens: each image (frost, starlight, poison memory) layers density until the ledger/frost homology re-weights meaning. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: her future art will monetize the very patterns that once marked her expendable—cost framed as professional exile. Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint is the poison legacy (“scorched testament”) that now reroutes her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tuning-fork strike thickens the thermal pattern until the final self-reading turns silence into visible music. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laptop’s golden pulse reweights prior frozen grief with a new sensory lexicon. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“winterglass conservatory”), well inside the 120-word grace window. Cost is unmistakable: she renounces the ocean’s auditory world and embraces a haptic future at the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: “some things must be buried before they can be kept” reweights the premise with conceptual cost—his lifelong flight from stillness ends in chosen stillness. Causal chain holds: lens fragment → heartbeat signal → underwater library → burial rites → lens restored; each because/therefore tightens his options. Orientation anchor (“Tuesday”) arrives at word 4; no penalty. Cost is legible in final image: intact lens glows but no longer signals, its silence the price of their peace.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens: the photograph tucked beside the bell reweights the entire pattern of anonymous gifts, making the exile’s return legible as future possibility with present cost. The because/therefore linkage holds—anonymous crates → nightly runs → bell ritual → photograph promise—without causal gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“terra-cotta arbor on the ridge”) and again at the patrol-avoiding culverts, satisfying the 120-word test. One minor scaffold: “This was the architecture of survival” summarizes what the scene has already shown, but it occurs mid-text and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara becomes the texture she sought, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights all prior grief. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each backward pulse intensifies density until the garden’s negative curvature externalizes her plight. Cost is legible in the final image—threads of experience permanently unwoven from chronology. One minor orientation wobble: “the space where the bridges met” is slightly vague, but the garden’s impossible knot is re-anchored by tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: piano-bench cipher → vault accessed → scout spared → seeds saved. Orientation anchored by word 60; demolition clock taught early and tightens to final image. Closure is Earned Stasis: she foregoes freedom now to plant later, chains literalising persistent constraint. Cost visible in last line: “iron around her wrists” as she walks toward dead zones.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the wire-snap sound of her own young trust become the aurora-tuned frequency she mails upward—cost is the audible self-betrayal she now immortalizes. Causal lattice holds: every beat is “because the greenhouse / forge / aurora permits,” culminating in the imprint that reweights her mission from understanding to gift-making. One minor orientation debt: the phrase “cells divide” is the only time cue for the “while” frame—readers may not feel the living clock until late.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: flower-code intel → body-block ruse → jar swap → flight; each beat narrows escape routes as sunset clock runs. Closure is a Decisive Change: collector’s loss is irreversible, Mira’s destiny door opens onto perpetual night-theft. Cost is on-page: “the first cry of dismay” behind her + moonbeam warmth against chest = wanted fugitive future. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark (platform, dusk, target bag); no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thaw imagery, dripping ceiling, and pulsing red light tighten the stake (“can I risk company again?”) without causal reversals. Orientation is swift—who/where/when clear by line 3. Closure is a Charged Poise: she sketches future labs on the dusty floor, foreclosing pure solitude with visible cost (terror/exhilaration). The bookmark’s inherited despair→hope reconfiguration is legible, though the moment of irrevocability could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sandra confesses, Marla records, future opens—cost is the lifelong terror now named. Causal chain holds from shell → cast → confession; one minor ellipsis (how recording legally secures justice) but not gaping. Drive lens is Causal, intact through final line.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each extinguished star thickens the texture of night until the booklet reconstitutes its gold into a navigable void. The “second-to-last star” beat delivers the required tightening; the map’s glowing lines provide visible cost and Charged Poise. Orientation is clean within 120 words; causality is lyrical but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the violin dissolves into snow, reweighting the loop as chosen ritual; cost is legible in “the timeline prepared to loop again…this Unit-7…had found peace.” Accumulative lens holds: each spiral adds density until the bowing crystallizes the archive. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“three hundred years of sweeping”) and anchors hold. No causal break—every return is motivated by the Program’s failure and Unit-7’s accrued consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, single POV, orientation locked by line 4; causal lens holds: because language died, Mira clings to ritual; because she observes Theo, they exchange objects; therefore their stances reconfigure. Closure is Earned Stasis: the lens transfer forecloses Mira’s protective distance and Theo’s isolation, cost felt in the crystalline echo that “spread the moment.” No teleporting props; every object (lens, ticket, pen) is introduced, handled, and transformed on stage. Persistent constraint—wordless world—shapes every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal arc: desire (prove sideways time) → twilight window → scanner set-up → anomaly capture → quiet closure with chip pressed to chest. Orientation is clean by line 8; no teleporting props; the magnetic nexus is set up, returned, and reweighted at the end. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the data irrevocably reweights her life and the station’s worldview—cost is the solitude she must keep nursing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s extraction of the confession reweights history and her own identity under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is coherent—each water-stain revelation is anchored to prior physical logic—but the late introduction of oilcloth that “should have dissolved” edges toward convenient durability. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by line 3. The single-scene default is met with no seams. Cost is felt in the final image: she seals the documents inside the cello case, literally carrying the price of disclosure into dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost, aurora, and smudged lily accrete to reweight silence as weapon. Closure is Charged Poise—Cassandra tucking the imperfect illustration into her coat—where the cost is the burden of unspoken extinction she will now carry alone. No orientation debt; mountain station anchored by word 50. One hairline slip: “she would give them nothing” telegraphs the final refusal a beat early.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because Clara’s calls exist → Marcus interprets → finds valve room → bead count reweights reality. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing—thirty-seven beads make the ghost shift undeniable and Marcus’s life-task legible. Cost is visible in the exhausted sit-down and the new weight he chooses to carry out.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts her eventual dissolution into the archive with visible cost—“she would become part of the accumulated silence.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; the final paragraph reweights the premise under the same regenerative silence that opened the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locket passage crystallizes “lifelong wonder” as chosen stance, with conceptual cost—Elena relinquishes the relic of infant-Maya to future-Maya. Accumulative lens holds: eclipse, sage scent, and root-network imagery tighten the mother-to-daughter hand-off. One soft spot: the eclipse mechanics are external backdrop rather than causal pivot; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Still, the final image reweights prior material with undeniable emotional cost under a coherent lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tapestry proves the axis tilt predates the Silence, reframing Maren’s quest. Causal linkage holds—diary → tapestry → map—but the decisive turn is summarized (“understood her purpose with sudden clarity”) rather than played beat-by-beat, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: she rewrites herself from hidden spy to public eccentric, price = surrender of secret archive. Causal chain—each fortune batch is a micro-act that accumulates to the final release of the specs—holds under Accumulative lens. Transition from past to present is legible at ~90 words; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening: the journalist’s imminent arrival collapses her options to “reveal or stay ghost.”

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elena’s yellow eyes clear, the entity dissolves, the anchor holds—earned reconfiguration with conceptual cost (“questions weren’t meant to be answered”). Causality is causal-loop tight: each rhetorical question physically weakens the possession, the pedal layers literally weave the silence weaponized. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no seams break, so the piece meets its lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored horizon, shell chambers, fortune fragments all spiral into the final dawn image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses to become conduit rather than author, with conceptual cost: she surrenders her lifetime craft. Transition from urban fortune-factory to Siberian spire is elliptical but legible; pattern of “listening for unheard frequencies” is taught early and paid off in the humming glass. Minor causality gap: no on-page reason she locates the exact spire beyond “grandmother’s envelope,” but the lyric contract accepts inherited fate.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the tablet’s release and her upward flight reweight the premise—no center, no escape, only perpetual self-creation. The causal chain holds: each procedural rune-shift she witnesses tightens the paradox until acceptance becomes the only on-page option. Cost is palpable: “for the first time, she felt not fragmented but whole” is legible only because she abandons the quest for unity. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and intact at the final image of spiraling timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crystalline Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken needle in pocket + “spring would come” image reweights silence from void to potential with felt cost (tears, unsteady legs). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each drum vibration thickens the pattern until the cadence shift lands. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One meaningful tightening suffices: the moment needle + large-drum vibration fuses touch and emotion, foreclosing permanent numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to “carry the message forward” reweights her earlier solitude into purposeful subversion, with the visible cost of endangering her quiet life. Causal linkage holds: message → pattern recognition → revised tactic; the brass tube recurs as constraint. One minor scaffold: “She would need to hide her journals…” forecasts instead of dramatizing, but the final image of “steady patience of storms” crystallizes options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/lyric lens taught early: each scent “ghost” layers density until the Silphium bloom and vial release re-weight all prior grief. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren stands in dawn light, vial against heart, options reconfigured—she is no longer afraid yet carries the price of permanent melancholy. Cost is legible in “one fewer extinction to mourn” and her swollen eyes. Pattern holds without causality breaks; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rope reweights “time accumulates” from thesis to lived cost, felt when the woman whispers “alive.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of object-readings thickens until the final grotto layer reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by line 10; no lens ambiguity. Minor causality dip: the woman’s arrival is lightly coincidental, but her entrance complicates rather than solves, so allowed under Situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is re-priced from suffocation to "space between notes," cost felt in the copper-glow image. Causal chain is slim—choice is internal listening—but sufficient under Accumulative lens; pattern taught early with smoke-settled quiet and intensifies via orchard/glass/water density. Orientation clean by line 5; no props teleport. Persistent constraint (hush) shapes every tactical note she plays; price visible when she accepts imperfection publicly tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grotto darkness, tucked petal, and new professional stance reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. Causal chain (stolen inhale → crack → grotto return → petal gift) holds; no plot amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 60; single transition inside continuous scene. Persistent constraint—her electrical sensitivity—shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the cycle of debt is re-weighted when Marina begins the next list—visible cost is legible. Causal chain holds: misdelivery → archives → plaque → new list. Single time-skip at midpoint is clean; orientation is anchored by word 80. Reflection blocks stay under 20 % and each cues a present-tilt action. Lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout—each reed sculpture is a deliberate tactic that summons response; the tag accumulates meaning until Senna steps forward, delivering a decisive change with cost (her solitary identity dissolves into communal risk). Closure lands under the obsidian arbor with visible communal cost: Veren’s circle of reeds is incomplete alone, crystallizing the new kinship rule. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within first 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the completed echo lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—her unknown truncated lifespan—under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The interrupted-cadence motif tightens across every beat, re-weighted in the final sketch image. Causality holds: pendant → borrow → cage dissolution → echo return. Orientation is clean; who/where/when are anchored by line 3 and reinforced by body-in-courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “the mathematics of emotion wasn’t about locating the lost… but mapping the shape loss carved.” This reweights every earlier equation and drip-tally; the cost is the irreversible acceptance of a living hollow. Causal chain holds—each mosaic gap → variable assignment → conjured composite—and ends in earned stasis rather than fake resurrection. Lens stays accumulative/textural throughout; the final cadence shift (“green shoot of optimism”) is the pattern break that crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s decision to place the letter re-weights her invisible role into gift-giver, felt cost the endangering of her hidden life. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of scavenged memory-objects accrues until the single, charged act of release. Sapphire hush → silver light cadence shift marks the tightening. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settled by line 3. Causality intact: tape fragment triggers memory → caches → final gift.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dissolved linden leaf plus rain-washed boundaries reweight her humanity and charge the closing image with undeniable cost. Orientation is clean by 50 words; causal lens holds: because the leaf appears / therefore she confronts the change → because she surrenders / therefore the leaf dissolves. No prop teleporting; reflection (dream-veins) is anchored to present stimuli and pays off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the joined walk and shared amber light reweight Mira’s sleeplessness from punishment to purpose, cost legible in “for the first time… witness.” Causal chain—rain trails → causeway → museum → exchange—holds without gaps; each step narrows options. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One minor slack: Theo’s appearance is pure coincidence, but the piece lets coincidence complicate, not resolve, so lens remains situational and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pearl reweights Vera’s vocation from future-fixation to present-awe, with unmistakable cost—“dawn breaking in colors she had never truly noticed.” Causal chain holds: pilgrim’s death → map → descent → pearl → present-sight. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final lamplight image reweights the premise—absence becomes navigable—at visible cost (lifelong vigil). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each salvaged fragment tightens the pattern. Orientation is clean by 120 words. The −0.2 non-closure cap reflects one minor scaffold: “Day after day” telescopes the decisive intensification instead of letting a single archival session crystallize the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain holds: because the cracks appear, therefore she follows; because the punch bites real metal, therefore the door opens; because she enters, therefore she meets the father. Closure lands cleanly under a Causal lens—her mapper identity is literally overwritten by her own contour lines on the door, a visible, irreversible cost. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (vault, mist, midnight), but the fortress rule-set is revealed only at the threshold; the early absence of any constraint or stakes beyond "disappearance" weakens propulsion until the door appears.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the journal’s seventeen pages of symbols reweight the premise, making the cost of refusal visible. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each starlit tile, whale note, and ink stroke accumulates until the final image reconfigures meaning. The tower’s purpose reframed as “sculpting space” delivers conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the map-curse inverts into a door, immortality itself revalued. The lens is Accumulative: boredom → storm → mutiny → release, each beat densifying the same stake. Causality holds: the storm physically rewrites the fragment, that rewrite enables her conspiracy, the conspiracy collapses the prison. A residual micro-gap: the exact moment the others obey her is elided, but the cost is legible in Aldric’s scream and Thessaly’s tears.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ink pot’s transfer re-weights three generations of debt into “even,” and Maya’s mathematics is rewritten from balance to transformation; causality holds under a single Causal lens, with every beat (asylum-for-theft, dying-for-return) tightening the ethical screw until the final image liquefies rigid ledgers.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mei tracing the worn spine reweights every prior dawn into embodied capital she can never spend, only carry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each numbered hum layers density until the catalogue itself becomes the irreversible cost. Orientation is swift (gilded-leaf stationer, mountain path, pre-dawn) and causality remains intact; no prop or rule is broken. The only bar to 9.0 is that the cost is felt conceptually, not viscerally—no blood, no broken lamp, no missed sunrise—so the repricing is elegant but not yet wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rising tide covers the erased maze while she waits “with the patience of the presumed dead,” a charged poise that reweights every prior erasure into unkillable testimony. Causality is clean—overheard fragment → poison label recognition → tomorrow’s confrontation—each because/therefore tightening the noose. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits re-entry into sanctioned life; the certificate’s nullification is irreversible. Lens (Causal) is taught early and held to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses pure debunking, keeps the shell, chooses wonder with a visible forfeiture of certainty; lens holds Accumulative/Textural—density of voices reweights her stance. Causality inside the cello beat is soft (why unfinished cello works is elided), but pattern is taught early and closure coherent. Spatial anchors (cliff, dome, stairs) clear by 100 words—no orientation debt. One micro-turn: bow drawn ⇒ voices dissolve armor; suffices for 800-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mosaic of graffiti breadcrumbs teaches its pattern early, transitions are legible, and the final symbol delivers a Charged Poise reweighting with felt cost (“unity in resistance” crystallizes the before/after). Causality is lightly elliptical—Mira’s persuasions are offstage—but the lens stays accumulative/textural and lands cleanly. Orientation is secure by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers another vanishing (darkness, father, film) until the satellite’s running lights break the pattern. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photo preserves what is already gone, reweighting progress with palpable cultural cost. Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The single beat of escalation suffices under this lens, cost visible in “It was enough.”

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single causal chain: seized drone → merchant’s noon deadline → Elara’s tactile diagnosis → patch → flight test → anchor lifts. Closure is Earned Stasis: she returns to shop, calm intact, with the felt cost of time spent and mist still pressing. Orientation locked by line 10. No reversals, but one meaningful tightening: harbor bells move closer. Stake stays local—one ship’s voyage—yet reweights her night-long labor.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Situational lens: accumulating environmental pressure (falcon, ice window, ticking freeze) crystallizes into a single stance—keep walking. Closure is Charged Poise: “the silence held. Maren kept walking” reconfigures stakes without thawing danger; conceptual cost (possible death for truth) is undeniable. Causality intact: falcon’s return → confirms passage → triggers departure; no teleport or luck. Orientation anchored by 75 words; no debt. One causal micro-turn inside the scene suffices at 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first cadenced footstep to final cobblestone hum; each repetition tightens the pattern until the town’s graceful fold feels inevitable. The closing image of the granddaughter re-primes the resonance, charging all prior beats with conceptual cost—Veradhen must die so memory can germinate. Closure lands with undeniable reconfiguration and no causal drift.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she ascends with an empty vial that now holds only her own witness, reconfiguring the premise from “capture” to “carry.” Causality holds: because she un-snags the tangle, therefore the vial can be ethically taken yet remains scientifically worthless—felt cost is legible in the final image pressed to her heart. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no orientation debt. One minor causality fuzz: the exact mechanism by which “overriding instinct” lets her succeed where the skeleton failed is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (inherited shame, scuffed door, copperlight repetition) and lets the lattice/screen become the tangible closure object; the final shatter of the hush-thing is the Decisive Change that reweights “belief” from abstract hope to material proof. Causality is coherent: letters → lighthouse → lattice → naming → creature destabilized. The only minor slack is the off-stage warden atrocity—usable as ticking clock, but feels outline-adjacent rather than on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: each bead is payment → resonance builds → dawn breaks, all foreshadowed by Maren’s intensifying solidity. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s rule-set flips from eternal night to sunrise, the price paid in generations of servitude. The 120-word orientation test is passed by line 6—glass cathedral, endless night, Elias as caretaker. Final image of the veil floating upward reconfigures stakes forever; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth is re-imagined from prison to garden, cost paid by seventeen years of secret mapping and the invisible surrender of ancestral cruelty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake—though the causal chain of “sewing paths that sleepwalkers can later walk” remains slightly magical rather than mechanically evidenced. Orientation is secure within 120 words; transitions are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain intact: diaspora skepticism → orchard discovery → dial repair → light generation → vow to replant. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing apples re-price time itself as faith-made, not solar, and Mira shoulders continuous, unpaid custodianship. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. The flashback block (mother’s retreat) is safely under 20 % and cues present choice—she places the gnomon to finish what her mother fled.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a CR: the mail-slot swallow reweights the entire premise—slow magic beats instant tech, and Vera’s life is foreclosed to repetition. Causal chain (chalk → transcription → letter → future escape) is airtight; 37-day clock is a persistent constraint. No orientation debt; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first image to final amber line.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: whisper-clusters, thread galaxies, and flame-flickers accrue until pattern-break (red stitch = Queen) reweights stakes. Orientation anchored by word 60; causality is thematic collation rather than consecutive events, acceptable under lens. Closure is Charged Poise—Mira’s new panel crystallizes risk—but cost is conceptual (empire may burn) not personal; still, price is legible under rule-set. No meaningful escalation beat after the red stitch; tension plateaus, preventing 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unsent letter becomes spoken apology, reconfiguring both filial guilt and medium’s vocation. Causal chain holds—moonlight → condensation → legible text → spoken word—each step narrowing options. The shard’s final pulse supplies persistent constraint and felt cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the coral fragment becomes discardable, the shrapnel is about to be removed, and “healing was just another form of translation” reweights the whole premise with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the smudged cast builds pattern, density increases as each word is reclaimed, and the final image crystallizes when Marina decides to let the tides take the coral. No orientation debt; who/where/when land within 70 words. Persistent constraint—linguistic guilt—shapes every micro-choice and the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared early (“within the fold of a daydream”) and held: each sensory layer of fog, crumbling wall, and projected light thickens the stake of artistic reclamation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragment warms, fusing ancient pigment to modern beam—knowledge network whispers old techniques, options re-weighted. Closure is Charged Poise: perpetual mist will keep her secret, the glowing mural a private covenant. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—she chooses perpetual twilight labor over daylight success.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: taxed thoughts → gourd-seed dead-drop → decoded garden plot → joint resolve. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair crystallize a covert future whose social cost is legible (“thoughts would be free again” vs. Bureau surveillance). Time remains free is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics; the notebook choreography page supplies the visible price. All orientation anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the galaxy postcard’s spiral is re-interpreted as the shell’s architecture and the poems themselves, paying off the mother’s injunction with conceptual cost—beauty is built, not found. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each stanza adds a layer of bioluminescent text that literalizes the transformation of grief into sustenance. Time-span is handled by patterned returns (300 yrs, 100 yrs, “tonight”) and a single continuous present-tense scene at the aperture, so orientation remains stable. No causal break; the lullabies’ pacifying effect is shown first, then accepted as the reef’s reality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural design taught early: orchid-name library, extinct feelings, spiral corridors. Escalation arrives via the echo of the lullaby gathering extinct phonemes; closure lands when the bamboo reseals and orchids bloom with recovered names—visible, sonic, charged. Causality is metaphorical but coherent under the lens of resonance; rhythm of listing extinct emotions builds density that the final cadence releases. No orientation issues; time/space anchors float but are legible by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered artifacts and confessions until the final “new symphony” reweights their shared silence. Closure is a Charged Poise—the empty inkwell charged with possibility—whose conceptual cost (they must now live the promises) is undeniable. Causality is clean: her invitation → his arrival → reciprocal unsnarling → joint translation; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the archive’s rules remain consistent; the single dusk-to-dawn window is respected.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira reseals the truth, accepting the same silence Elara endured, but now as a conscious tactic awaiting alliance. The cost is legible—she walks back into daylight carrying the chain and the burden of postponed justice. Causal lens holds throughout: because Elara hid, Mira decodes, therefore she chooses strategic silence. No orientation drift; amphitheater breathing teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Track B mosaic (four shards) taught by 25 % and lands a clean CR: the meteorite reweights “falling, forgetting, finding” for both bird-stone-self. Transitions (newspaper wrap → skylight ritual → Mira’s arrival) are legible; each shard adds density rather than causal plot, satisfying Accumulative lens. Closure image—“dust settled into darkness, waiting for tomorrow’s sun”—carries conceptual cost: she accepts perpetual vulnerability of trust. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the prism terrace stops, the threshold opens, Wren steps through clutching the logbook—cost is the exile itself, now ended. Causal lens holds: because she deciphers the codes as prayers and accepts “necessary distances,” the drift halts and the architect’s search restarts. Orientation is taught early by disorienting refractions that payoff at the sacred edge. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shared exhale re-weights belonging from performance to witness. Causality is intact: the burnt-feather reading leads to the joint observation that earns the invitation to return. Orientation is anchored by moon-pool descent + geodesic dome within 120 words; no penalty. Cost is felt: she leaves with “strange, quiet certainty” that the path back to people now runs through this depth and this person—an opportunity still unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of transliteration → seed conjecture → transliteration re-weighted. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira plants seeds while holding the glass, crystallizing a new stance whose cost is the permanent not-finding. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3). No causal break; every beat adds density or cadence shift. Minor slack: the bird vector is late-revealed, not seeded earlier, a hairline nick in pattern coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single continuous scene, one POV; orientation (who/where/when) anchored within first 80 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each calculated detail (bishop placement, tide schedule, acoustic map) thickens the texture until the final reverb of coins and distorted star-ripples reweights the premise—wonder can be engineered yet remain wild. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bishop back in pocket, the arcade’s geometry already eroding, her smile disappearing between columns—options reconfigured, cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the dancers’ dawn rechristens them permanently exiled yet cosmically anchored—cost felt in “never belong to the provinces again.” Causal chain holds: nostalgia ban → Selene’s exile → secret garden → Kira’s arrival → inscription → shared outlaw dance. One-shard default met; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Persistent constraint (moonstone ink, irreversible script) shapes tactics and final image. No orientation or lens ambiguity; the tide-and-moon rule-set reweights at the end with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the atrium’s slow refractions, the widening ripples, and the shifting mist layer density until the council’s demolition date becomes conceptually re-priced as irrelevant. Closure earns Charged Poise: Elena’s realization that “value was not fixed in objects but in the attention we bring” reweights the stake on the page, and the image of colored fingers gilding the boat makes the cost legible without exposition. Causality is associative rather than because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5, well inside the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the ashes reweights the rule that “pain must be translated,” proving translation unnecessary—an undeniable conceptual cost. The porcelain box returns in the final image, its emptiness and crack now the “truest memorial,” cleanly reconfiguring meaning. Causal lens holds: because he accepts the crack, he can descend; therefore the bargain myth is renounced. Cost is visible in the last two sentences—an empty, broken object carried toward “ordinary cruelties.” No orientation or lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (bargain myth) pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: triangle → Geneva trial reweights hope from diffuse to single direction with real opportunity cost (time, money, Elise’s fragility). Causal chain intact: grief → grotto discovery → bead experiment → Hoffman signal; no teleporting props. One shard, single POV, orientation anchored by ~120 words. Cost is felt but off-page; no constraint or price is dramatized at exit to foreclose alternatives, holding the beat below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a CR: the final sentence—“they dreamed of exactly this moment”—reprices the entire premise, making the walls’ consciousness undeniable and charging Mira’s future labor with conceptual cost. The Accumulative lens is taught by the repeating gesture (hand on stone) and holds to the last line; orientation is anchored by word 80 (“ivy-veiled passage”). One meaningful tightening occurs when she swaps live mapping for salvaged diaries, narrowing her agency from explorer to inheritor. No causal break; cost is legible in the weight she now shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the painting propped against the parapet becomes a mirror of possibility, reweighting the premise that reflection can be revolution. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light, rain, heartbeat layers accrue until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is swift (terrace, spring dusk, vespers bell) and the prism parapet’s rule is taught early and paid off at the end, so no penalty applies. The only hairline slip is that the “cost” is more conceptual than physically tasted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the handshake and Elara’s descent reconfigure meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens—ink on paper plus celestial movement re-weight decades of grief. Causality holds: the ritual alignment she orchestrates forces the simultaneous signatures, and the exhausted “tomorrow” stance forecloses rest. Orientation is anchored by line 3; transitions are seamless within the single terrace scene. Cost is legible in her throat-clench and the heavy clipboard at the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal track: drought → exposed lakebed → map of cracks → cavern → burial of song. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the egg and speaker left behind reweight her lifetime of “terrible bargains” into one unpaid gift; cost is the irreversibility of her exit across white nothing—felt in salt skin she never brushes off. Orientation locked by 50 wds; no prop teleport. One tightening: the instant she presses PLAY, the option to keep the egg is foreclosed. Lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism dims, the threads are gone, and Meridia’s solitude is permanently rewired into collectivity. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each untangled thread thickens the ancestral texture until the final inhale reweights her identity. The orientation is immediate (snow, courtyard, naked shoulders), and the lens holds. Cost is unmistakable in the final image: she is warm despite the snow, carrying voices that will now speak through her.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: argument → silence → puppet show → reversed certainties → dust marks that foreclose old stances. Closure is a Charged Poise: the question mark beside 聽 charges every prior ethical claim with mutual, visible cost. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Meteor-hush metaphor is earned, not imposed. Cost is legible in the final image—no further exposition needed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the butterflies pause, acknowledge, move on—an undeniable reconfiguration of Vera’s witness. Causality is accumulative/textural: each knotted frame intensifies the density of memory until the final spiral of wings reweights the stake. The cost is the moth wing itself—relinquished to the wind—and the grotto’s impermanence, both legible in the last line. No orientation debt; pattern is taught by 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the rope’s new pattern sings the names, the aurora answers, and Elin becomes “mold and metal both.” The final image reweights the premise—permanence through release—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each braid adjustment accumulates density until the cadence shift of the first sung name.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sky “she had never seen in any dream” reconfigures all prior phantom timelines with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because she breaks the seal, she inherits witness-duty; therefore she refuses ownership. The decaying directive and storm tighten options until the final image. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by word 52. Persistent constraint: lifelong uncertainty as path-servant.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers pattern (magic square, stellar translation, tile) until the final image crystallizes the covenant. Orientation is secure by l. 60; the 17-year orbital payoff is the Conceptual Repricing beat that makes the cost legible—Mira will spend the rest of her career waiting. The only hairline slip is a mild explanatory lull midsentence (“she understood the absurdity…”) that slightly blunts the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Thorne’s stance crystallizes when he cups the mute box—silence itself becomes the chord of release. Causal chain holds: broken cylinder → tactile memory → cellular recall → unclench; each beat tightens options. The 0-word orientation at the threshold is deliberate disorientation that later pays off when “sound refused to exist” re-enters as thematic cost. Time and space remain liminal but legible; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—peace can live inside a weapon-carrier’s marrow.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the dream fled → mirrors forged → sextant rebuilt → breath sync → boundary thins → she refuses now yet keeps the way open. One continuous scene anchored by ~70 words; no orientation debt. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the fog felt different now—invitation,” re-weighting all prior toil with future possibility; cost is the deferred dream and continued exile. Persistent constraint—tomorrow she must begin again—shapes next mirror, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon transfer reweights the generational pact, cost is felt (“teach you instead”). Causal chain holds: breach → abandoned hall → letter → orchard → bag → recommit. Orientation anchored by word 40; no disorientation persists. Drive lens is Causal; because/therefore links tighten options until the final vow renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mosaic shard structure (journal-portal → orchard → bathroom → grove) is taught by 25 %, transitions are legible, and the ending lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: Maren realizes she must perpetuate the loop. Causality is nonlinear yet coherent; the bathroom beat satisfyingly pays off the tile clue with felt cost—“she left changed.”

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Mira deciphers the diary’s chlorophyll map, therefore she reaches the mountain; because she realizes the mountain rescues rather than traps, therefore she offers to teach instead of steal, and Thessaly is released. The Library’s relocation rule is taught early and pays off when Mira’s offer—reconfiguring the rescue premise—literally brings Thessaly up the stairs. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the mountain keeps its shame-shelves, Mira leaves pledged to a lifelong pedagogy she may never finish. Minor time-traveler convenience (seventeen loops off-page) is the only causal shortcut, not enough to ding the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sisters choose remembrance, fog thins, sun breaks—on-page cost is the sister’s solidity nearly lost. Causal chain holds: emerald cue → poster recognition → carousel confrontation → invented narrative → corporeal return. One soft spot: the ship’s “gentle rocking” is declared but never shown affecting movement or balance, a micro teleport. Orientation is fixed by line 5; no debt. Lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: seal discovery → door appearance → braid repair → bell tone, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the tower’s lost ceremonial function is restored, Mira’s worldview permanently widened, signaled by the “tone it hadn’t produced in two hundred years.” No orientation or telegraph issues.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the hush-bloom reconfigures meaning when the echo-stone’s total absorption becomes an on-page image of reclaimed silence. Causal chain holds—ice-crack reading → draft discovery → chamber entry → silence tool activation—each step foreclosing prior options. Cost is visible in her “earned exhaustion” and the foregone reliability of her body’s knowledge. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off in final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: prism vision → date recognition → beacon relight → visible signal. Orientation is clean by line 4; the single transition from pavilion to tower is sign-posted. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beam ignites exactly as stars align, reweighting prior coincidences into cosmic grammar with felt conceptual cost—survivors will migrate toward her light, foreclosing her solitude. The lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn smoke drifting through blooming vines crystallizes the before/after—Elara re-enters world bearing usable ash, path foreclosed of despair. Causal lens holds: mosaic message → ascent → ignition; each beat narrows options until “ignite or retreat.” Cost is legible on-page: the singed knot’s soot on palms, grandmother’s admitted cruelty, Elara’s dawn departure with burden of next audience. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) secured by line 10; no lapses; transitions cleanly two-shard (courtyard → tower).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“time moved like the tides”) and held: every tidal image adds density until the final “space between heartbeats” reweights the stake. The grotto’s starlight and pools serve as repeating texture that makes the final silence legible as Charged Poise. Closure lands with conceptual cost: Mira’s life-work insight is exactly what she must trade for her daughter. The slight deduction is for a single causal elision—how Elena’s “teach me” emerges from silence is not micro-motivated beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: gravity re-normalizes, options reconfigure, and the unspoken price—her body’s memory of bunker walls—remains palpable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each silence layer, vine growth, and inversion moment thickens the texture until the final hush reweights freedom itself. Orientation is taught early; the trellis and inversion rules are learned through act and image, never dump. The only hairline slip is the late explicit tag “the original wound,” which briefly lectures what the image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terrace’s silence is permanently rewired by the dissolved crystals, and the cost—final loss of the relic—hits on-page. Causal chain is spare but complete: monitor → locate pocket → open vial → silence transformed. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; the helix image teaches the pattern early and re-weights at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lattice holds: each peeled mural is a because/therefore trigger that narrows the path toward the tree. Closure is a Decisive Change—she steps onto the first immaterial stair—paid for by the dissolved heirloom and the dawn-clock. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation inside the kaleidoscopic waterfall is taught early and pays off when the tree turns translucent. Lens purity intact: every image reconfigures options under Causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the threshold reforms as a thinner membrane, re-weighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain is tight—scar-link summons Sera, ritual ring-tending makes the admission possible, the doorway image repays the bridge-burning rule. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“the ashen charcoal sanctuary…”) and the lens (Hybrid→Causal at end) is legible throughout. Only the thinnest waver: Sera’s sudden arrival is accepted without on-page resistance that might have sharpened the cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts via density of glowing fungi, glitch texts, and concept-manifest until Vera crystallizes it into diamonds. Closure is a Charged Poise—she gathers the stones, future tactics re-weighted, cost legible in trembling fingers and the snapped-shut porthole bolt. Orientation is clean by word 60 (bunker, 3:47 AM). No meaningful escalation errors; each fungal pulse and scrambled message thickens the same stake. Persistent constraint—dimensional thinning returns—shapes her vow to volunteer again.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty’s value is inverted on-page when Margaret chooses the moth-gray manual over fortune, felt cost in the “warm paths” of tears. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: amber→purple dusk, slowing platter, and silence itself accrete until meaning reweights. No causality breaks; every beat is linked by “listening” pressure. Persistent constraint established: the standing-wave room will henceforth demand truthful silence from her.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: each glowing fruit / pattern repetition deepens the stake until the star-birth image reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: empty-handed knight becomes conduit, cost legible in irrevocable “withdrawn-but-present” stance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dust pattern → button discovery → database vow; each layer adds density without causal reversals, landing in Charged Poise—“she would also never stop looking”—with felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalties. Closure effect is present and reweights earlier material. Missing one tightening turn that forecloses an option on-page keeps it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single causal track (Vault → upload → reappearance) is coherent and lands a clean Charged Poise: her daily smile now carries the secret knowledge that truths are leaking worldwide. Stakes tighten only once—midnight raid alert—so escalation is thin; nevertheless, the lens holds. Closure cost is conceptual (global doubt seeded) rather than personal, fulfilling the Hybrid lens judged at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy shatters inside her, felt cost is legible in the dawn-lit dew, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Causality is interior—because she rehearses negative-space melodies every morning, the coded words finally lose purchase—so the tightening is pattern-based rather than external reversal. One transition (shift from present playing to generational flashback) is handled cleanly; no orientation debt. The ending image refracts prior motifs without explanatory filler.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moonstone dissolving into skin reweights her world-rule—“she could finally, fully comprehend.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises via leaf monuments → pattern break at hush → cadence shift when messages become invitations. Cost is visible—“her edges blur,” a price paid in identity. Only micro-slippage: orientation is complete before 120 words, but the causal hinge (why this particular hush triggers transformation) is slightly under-cued.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass that “doesn’t point north” reweights her entire philosophy of time and certainty. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each artifact (ashes, greenhouse, logbook) thickens the pattern until the final image of “magnificently imprecise” water reconfigures meaning. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the trade that defined her life. Causality holds: every discovery is tethered to the dead client’s breadcrumb trail.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the metal’s “imperfect sheen” reweights the father’s name from poison to golden seam—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the cracks remain). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: rain, furnace glow, and coin rub layer density until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words), but the single-scene default is stretched by a fifteen-year ellipses that is told, not shown; because the lens is accumulative this does not break causality, yet it slightly weakens the tightening moment. No meaningful escalation inside the scene—pressure is atmospheric, not tactical—so the beat qualifies as one deepening rather than a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: slack harp strings tighten the pattern of forgotten laughter-memories that avalanche back in distorted chords, reweighting her purpose. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the ache remained, but now it glowed” crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation anchor (“who/where/when”) arrives by line 3; no ambiguity. Cost is irrefutable—she leaves the gorge transformed, carrying a changed internal temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elena’s burial of the mask strap reweights the colony’s algorithmic cruelty into her own “warmer equation.” Cost is legible in the final image—“a seed of her own transformation”—and the persistent constraint of hyper-proprioception that will keep every memory tactile. Causal lens holds: escape → forest decoding → rewriting mercy. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) reach reader by ~100 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each stall and painting adds density to the erased-history pattern until the hidden stitch is revealed. The lighthouse lens fragment acts as the charged poise beat—its light reweights the city’s visible/ invisible strata. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: she now sees the ghost layers she must spend her life translating. The thirty-year wait pays off grandmother’s set-up without talkiness.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Miriam’s decision to deliver the mainspring to the historical society is a Decisive Change that costs her professional neutrality. Causal chain holds—dust pattern → ghost cue → hidden panel → choice—without convenient amnesia. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 120 words; condemned 1987 circus office is clear. The reflective block (grandmother ghost) is one substantial block ~18% and tilts present stance, so BRR obeyed.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns → bottled whisper → library’s laughter form a density wave that reweights the stake from stasis to descent. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystalline architecture cracks, the library exhales, and the page-snow reseeds reality—cost is felt in the simultaneous loss of perfection and Maren’s press. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but each image accretes meaning without contradiction; the final image of “slow descent” crystallizes the new grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the asteroid becomes doorway, not tomb, and Maren’s passage re-weights the entire premise. Causal chain holds: shard as key is set up → mirror ritual → temporal sight → stepping through. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 4; no debt. One causality bump: “the vase shard wasn’t a fragment… it was a key” is declared, not discovered through action, but the image is paid off immediately. Cost is legible—she vanishes from the academic frame, notes scattered—so Earned Stasis is satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chip’s light is not restored to Elias’s past but dispersed into future songs—cost is the vanishing stone and his acceptance of mortality. Causal chain holds: dishonesty detected → music stops → confession → transmutation. Orientation is swift; “tonight, the chamber felt different” anchors time and place by line 3. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights all prior mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the compass whirls, categories collapse, and Maren’s stance crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost—“she was simply no longer looking for the way back.” Causal chain holds: silence above → descent → compass psychometry → vision → threshold → renunciation. No teleporting props, no retroactive patches. The lens shifts from causal search to accumulative/textural revelation, taught early by the “resonant hush” and paid off in the final breath of petrichor.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lightning layer reweights the slide’s meaning, tightening until the final image of “bridge-shadow” reconfigures her path; cost is the foreclosure of solitary art-for-art’s-sake. Orientation clean by line 5; closure lands with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered glass images, postcard echoes, and mural coats build density until the final “midnight congregation” reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—inside 50 words we have who (Mira), where (amber pavilion), when (last snow melting). The meaningful tightening happens at the fourth glass layer—human figure replaces bloom, forcing her pivot from observation to gift-making. Cost is visible: annual returns, perpetual additions, the pavilion forever open to others’ grief—she trades private answer for public stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a classic Earned Stasis: Celeste gains testimony but forfeits scholarly neutrality; the cost is felt when she climbs back “carrying the weight of voices.” Causal chain holds: diary → visions → map coordinates → physical journey → testimony recorded; each because/therefore link narrows her options until only exposure remains. No teleporting data; the tube, cipher, and debris language all pay off on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the stone crumbled → the village fled → Mira acts; because she communes rather than opens → she crystallizes lanterns → the people return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “amber light” reweights the premise—home is now self-lit, not wish-lit—and the cost is felt in her imminent departure. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props; every beat advances knowledge or option.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final cuneiform glow crystallizes her shift from recorder to living oath, cost felt in “velvet disquiet.” Causality holds—field-trip memory seeds ability, shaving triggers prophecy, apples confirm coordinates. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“Meridian Tower…3:47 AM”). One micro-turn: archival passivity → accidental prophet. No meaningful escalation under causal lens, but accumulative density reweights stake at end; lens ambiguity waived because pattern taught and closure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atrium stays frozen but is re-categorized as living archive, cost paid by the vortex now “in her blood.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory layer (starlight ribbons, molecular song) tightens the stakes until the cap-on-fountain act crystallizes options. Orientation is clean—who/where/when fixed by word 80. One minor loop: “frozen and somehow more alive” repeats the alive/dead toggle three times, dulling the final reconfiguration by anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is pristine: the rope’s first pull becomes the Decisive Change, shifting the sanctuary from perpetual silence to acknowledged equilibrium. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—every microclimate reading layers toward zero hour, then the bell’s frequency reweights the stakes without violence. Cost is legible in the final sentence: the sanctuary settles into “its next season of patient silence,” meaning Mira has spent her one audible currency. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stardust sweep and amber-glass observation layers density until the dawn image reweights “stillness” as active survival. Closure is a Charged Poise: the captured sunrise in yellow glass crystallizes her lifelong bargain—lonely vigil for cosmic intimacy— with undeniable conceptual cost; the station “waits for a world that had forgotten how to look up” foregrounds the price of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each ghost visit layers another “stone” of silence into the box, tightening the density of preserved muteness until the final charged poise—Maren cradling the still-closed box—reweights the stakes. Closure lands cleanly: the box stays shut, the cost is the perpetual custodianship she accepts in the dying light. No loops or missing anchors; orientation is fixed by word 50. The persistent constraint (custodian silence) shapes every tactical choice and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the capsule seals, Vera’s role flips from borrowed to essential, and the cost is the irrevocable commitment of her remaining years. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each garage-sale listing adds density until the pattern snaps into purpose. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored within 50 words. No lens ambiguity; final image reweights premise (“time collects like dust on forgotten shelves”) with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the kite’s wobble then steady climb reweights the “incomplete” motif with visible cost—the feather’s torn barb glints as it ascends, foreclosing a return to unblemished beauty. Causality is accumulative: each fragment (rain-stopped lagoon, found feather, snapped kite) layers texture until pattern crystallizes in the final image. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens holds without ambiguity. No orientation or lens cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s humming pillars reweight death into slower time, cost felt in Maren’s last smile. Causal chain holds—diagnosis → copper circuits → teaching → final surrender—each beat tightening options under mortal clock. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 3; no disorientation persists. Persistent constraint (six-month timer) shapes every tactic; final image crystallizes new conversational order.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens teaches its pattern early—each coordinate a preserved shard—and tightens when Mira sees the fly as “a bridge between worlds,” landing on a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her entire academic stance; the cost is palpable in her quiet “yes” that forecloses the safety of pure skepticism. All causality is coherent under the inferred lens; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each beat layers reef-to-flower chemistry, bird-message density, and seed-release ritual toward the final glowing image. Closure is a Charged Poise: future garden crystallizes as inevitable possibility while Erasmus stands in poignantly legible stasis. Anchors (who/where/when) signalled by line 3; no orientation debt. Cost is conceptual—reef’s dissolution forever alters sea and self—made legible in “garden that existed mostly in the future.”

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean CR: the map and leaf reprice “distance” into “steps,” felt in the final image of walking. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is a because/therefore of scent–cue → memory → new physical action. The phonograph groove trick is foreshadowed by Ven’s tactile study, paying off when the leaf-box mechanics prove Sera’s alive-signal. Single orientation dip: “the eastern wastelands” is vague geography, but the emotional GPS is so sharp the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira presses the compass rose back onto the journal, renouncing rescue-as-salvation while the ship still inches across the glass. The cost is legible—“true north was never a fixed destination” now means solitary continuance—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each yearly sketch tightens the pattern until the final image reweights solitude as chosen exploration. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. One tiny hairline: the shutdown’s exact timeline is back-loaded, but it never perturbs causality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: sky-wrong → lid retrieval → chess swap → vault opens → cure + letter, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is earned stasis: he accepts lifelong guardianship, foreclosing the thief path with visible cost (weep-laugh, new duties). Orientation clean by 75 words; time-fold rule is taught early and repaid when secrets echo across folded time. Minor loop: “wonder demanded both” and “sacredly playful reverence” are adjacent near-synonyms; does not break causality but dulls final image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each circuit of the gallery thickens the density of memory until the restored pawns reweight the chessboard from symbol of erasure to memorial. Orientation locked by sentence 5; no causality breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: the board is “made whole and strange,” a CR that conceptually reprices the monarchy’s original erasure. Cost is legible—she walks out of paid purgatory into unfinanced witness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lost language is not retrieved into mind but inscribed into mercury flesh, a Charged Poise that reweights “home” from place to fluency. Causal linkage holds: each nightly failure (bleeding dawn) forces the tactile workaround that ultimately lets her speak. The persistent constraint—memory loss at sunrise—shapes every tactic and is visible in the final image of climbing “mercury and memory.” Cost is legible in the phrase “finally whole enough to hurt.”

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the knight’s absorption into the platinum rewrites the rule-set—“guilt was a labyrinth with no exit until one stops walking.” Cost is visible in the moment flour dust finally moves. Causal lens dominates: because he decodes the tapestry, therefore he can cede the knight and accept stasis. Orientation is secure by line 4; no prop or knowledge teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bone tower now holds a “spectrum of humanity,” reweighting the ritual’s rule-set with undeniable social cost—Elders’ authority dissolved in their own canyon. Causal chain holds: childhood acoustics → refract plan → dawn execution → tower hums. Orientation anchored by word 30; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the moment the spire “hummed” and Elders’ commands became indistinguishable poetry.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new pockmark match tightens the density of memory and stakes until the pattern itself becomes the crucible. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“acid sea hissed against copper pontoons”), so no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s gold-veined cracks crystallize her stance; the cost is the irreversible loss of both charm and daughter, felt on-page (“I couldn’t save you”). Persistent constraint: the floating workshop now literally depends on the gold tracery she created, tying future survival to her remembered pain.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mirror crack → wrong turn → cave discovery → painted merger of shell-sunset is a clean because-therefore chain that lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: fragmentation reframed as generative. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3 and are re-anchored after the spatial transition to the cave. Persistent constraint—the shell’s faded colors—literally shapes the final canvas, charging the image with cost. No lens ambiguity; causality holds through the final “colors finally ran out.”

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Mira holding both cork and boy reweights the rule-set—tending the living and the lost is now one job. Causality is lyric-accumulative: scent→arrival→hand→descent; each beat deepens the central stake of listening as rescue. The cost is felt in the lingering scent’s fade and the boy’s still-flickering edges, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure grows through pattern thickening (calls, mirror positions, lunar alignment) rather than causal chains. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—star-beams become a “path for loss itself,” reweighting grief into service; the cost is the lifelong watch she accepts. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no orientation debt. The winter-solstice deadline and final self-call provide the decisive cadence shift required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: storm → loss → isolation → relic arrival → lie test → decision to share. Each “therefore” tightens options until the final beat reconfigures meaning: she can now choose silence, a decisive change with felt cost. The glass-eye reveal is perfectly timed at the golden 25 % mark; closure image of “almost whole” crystallizes the new stance. No orientation debt; anchoring of ravine, platform, and storm is complete by line 60.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the empty page becomes a communal space where stranger, woman, and keeper coexist, reconfiguring Elias’s isolation at undeniable emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the skipped-logbook pattern taught early (every seventh day) accumulates into the final handwriting act. Causality is present but subordinate—he acts *because* the gaps invited him—fitting the lyric design. Cost proof: “The sea took his body, but his love stayed stubborn…” makes the price legible in one sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that swaps fantasy for knowledge, leaving her absent shop as visible cost. Causal chain holds: chip→arch→visions→decision, each step because/therefore. One minor pressure droplet: the creek-as-clock is declared but never forces a mid-scene tactical change; the rising water stays backdrop rather than narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change: the queen exits the grotto knowing she will act, price attached—she lets mist “hide her until she was ready,” a charged poise that reweights the premise. The causal lens holds: each beat (climb, oracle truth, firefly sign) tightens options toward unavoidable regicide. Orientation is firm within 120 words; no teleporting props. The cost—memory reclaimed, innocence surrendered—is legible on the final page (“bleeding starlight had taught her…that some truths…become weapons”), satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira re-weights her premise from “trap time” to “pay attention,” with felt cost—she relinquishes the shell and the protective illusion of objectivity. Causal lens holds: pocket-sun flare → shell surrender → parting mandate; each beat narrows her option set. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (ember nexus, twilight, two bodies). No teleporting props; shell and sun track cleanly. One hairline slip: “palette of resolve” is named once without prior setup, but the image is immediately re-practiced on-page, so lens integrity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: scroll entries, grave, flight memory layer into a pattern break—she stops fearing the end and writes toward it. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the chaos was the narrative” reweights premise without tidy fix; cost is the perpetual temporal vertigo she accepts. Orientation clean by 120 words; no causal reversals needed under this lens. Minor slip: “three weeks / eleven years / decades” timeline could feel outline-like, but density of sensory anchors keeps beat-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed screw reweights the clamp from shame-object to lineage-instrument under an accumulative/textural lens—each water drop counts emotional debt. Causality is clean: improper cleaning (Margaret’s mother) → corrosion → Elena’s precision rescue → Margaret’s tearful reclaiming; no off-stage fixes. Persistent constraint—Elena’s permanent anosmia—shapes her tactics and is reiterated in the final image of water clocks she will never smell. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; fog lifting parallels internal shift, paying off disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore links—memory triggers frost → breath held → tea traced → frost sheds → scar remade. Orientation anchors within 120 words: floating rock, amber twilight, solitary apprentice. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scar’s iridescence re-weights her premise from curse to alphabet. Cost is legible in the lightning-branch now publicly legible—she forecloses anonymity. Slight drag: the “tomorrow she would return” future-tell edges toward summarised aftermath; cost is felt but not yet socially paid, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: because he failed thirty years ago, he now rigs copper coils to finish the symphony and trap the demon. Orientation is swift (who/where/by ~80 words). Closure is Earned Stasis: he ends kneeling among dead scores, carrying both demon and dream—cost visible in the double weight. Minor slack: the electromagnetic method is sprung late, so the beat feels slightly conjured, not seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank dictionary she chooses to write in reweights language itself from static archive to open vessel—cost is the erasure of every human word, felt in the hush that follows. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of spiral imagery and layered illusions intensifies until the final image crystallizes meaning without causal reversals. Structure is single-scene, single-POV, within length; orientation is deliberately cosmic but anchored early by tactile feet on stone and the dictionary prop. No meaningful tightening or trade-off mid-arc; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing, so the repricing is elegant but not preceded by sacrificed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the inverted count snaps the lattice open and Einar steps into a realm that re-weights every prior drip as a doorway; the cost is the absolute erasure of his presence (key spinning unattended). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetition of drip, fjord quiet, and backward numerals accumulates until the pattern breaks reality. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“cliff’s edge”) and reinforced by brass instruments aimed at sea-sky interface; no penalty. Causality holds: each backward number tightens the lattice, creating the razor edge that literally slices him out of the world. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the key’s hidden placement beneath the floorboard is paid off when it keeps spinning after he vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the red laser dissolving into impossible glow reweights “letting go” from rupture to permeability. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cluster of mushrooms thickens the emotional substrate until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible in the line “she finally let herself weep” after the ghost-mushroom epiphany. One hairline slip: the Estate/property legalities are skimmed; no constraint from that quarter shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine holds: father’s marginal note → subway rides → discovery of Seat 14 → library archive → closure of acceptance. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition from subway to library is telegraphed by the GPS coordinates. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the candle’s cracked mica reweighting the rule that damage and function coexist—so cost is visible. A micro-teleport of the notebook (it appears in her hands without immediate cue) barely nicks the linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each call layer thickens Vera’s role as grief conduit until the glass refracts a new pattern for the caller. Closure is a Charged Poise—Vera’s quiet readiness for the next ring—whose conceptual cost (lifelong surrogate exile) is palpable in the final image. Causality within the magical premise is tight: the booth exists only at lamp-shift, the disc refracts only under vibration, and advice loops back to Vera’s first lesson. Orientation, stakes, and timeline are anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: handing over the locket crystallizes her new covenant with felt cost—she loses the last tangible face of her grandmother. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: every catalogued scrap → Keeper appears → covenant renews. Beat 1–4 teach pattern early; no orientation debt. One soft spot: “covenant regenerated around them like spring warmth” tells the change instead of dramatizing a visible shift; still, the locket transfer keeps the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s offer to “help distribute” reweights her lifetime rule of detachment, cost signaled by “gentle chains of reciprocity” that “felt… like freedom.” Causal lens holds: every favor she accepted (Nepal→Bangladesh→Honduras→Philippines) tightens the noose of debt that finally binds her. Orientation is clean by line 10; single-scene default met. One micro-turn (fox returns with companion) prefigures her own acceptance, tightening without overt coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she charts the stillpoint, then renounces it, paying with permanent exile from that neutrality. Causal chain holds: ring → branch → musical trail → silence → choice; no teleporting props or retroactive rules. Orientation is late (commission revealed ~⅔ in) but the delay is functional—it mirrors her own delayed understanding of the gift—so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the Kepler sun brightens in real time, rewriting genocide into possibility. The causal lattice holds: anomaly folds time → future question arrives before past genocide → present edit broadcasts → star rebrightens. Cost is on-page: “she would never be entirely certain” and the pen set down “carefully” (a quiet stasis that forecloses the old guilt). Lens (Causal) is unbroken; the cross-cap for 9+ is met; no orientation debt; no artifact touches the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each silence Mira catalogs thickens the port’s atmospheric stake until Elena’s request detonates it into action. Orientation lands cleanly by line 40 (who/where/when). Closure—Elena walking toward chambers with “silence like a torch”—is a Charged Poise that reweights meaning; the conceptual cost is legible: the harbor’s future now hinges on a language of gaps, not words. Causality is intact: because Mira taught, therefore Elena can attempt disruption, and Mira’s invisibility is the persistent price that shaped tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Miriam beneath the vandalized portrait, weeping with a grief that “could have melted stone,” reconfigures her exile into homecoming and her criminal act into rescue. The causal lens holds throughout: arson → flight → descent → genetic revelation. A persistent constraint (she can never resurface) is cemented in the final line. Cost is unmistakable and emotionally scaled to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each percussive layer adds density until the garden itself “breathes” the fused dream. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias diffuses into the sound lattice, Mira accepts eternal surveillance as price. Cost is visible: “the loneliness felt different now… space left after completing something.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks; pattern taught early (quantum-fiber haunt) pays off in final shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is lean: storm → compass failure → sonic tracking → stranger → key-as-template → hidden archive. One micro-turn (key = map crease template) rewrites route and lands the pair at the father’s cache. Closure is an earned stasis: Celia accepts her role as keeper of whispered knowledge; the cost is the tacit covenant to keep hiding, felt in the final auroral hush.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy walks away alive, guardian’s silence charged with new meaning—darkness taught to hold stars—felt cost is the ongoing vigil she must keep. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: because she keeps weaving patterns, therefore the canal’s menace is re-weighted for the boy and for us. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“junction where old waterway met newer concrete”); no debt. No causality break; every beat grows from prior light-weave. Cost is legible in “she remained at her post…spiralingly calm,” foreclosing any prospect of her own release.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: gift → silent hearings → tutoring → Marcus → window plot; each step is legible under a Causal lens. The single orientation anchor arrives at word 123 (“Eleanor Chen climbed its steps at precisely seven-fifteen”), just inside the waiver window, and the disorientation (mist, bruise) later pays off in the charged poise of the final image. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: she walks away, board abandoned, path foreclosed; cost is conceptual—she surrenders her private sanctuary to public uncertainty—but still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the island’s fade reweights the premise that surrendering violence also surrenders the surface world, and Mira’s crossing carries the visible cost of never returning. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—whale-song and glowing scrimshaw lines tighten the texture until the cadence shift of “Then she dove” detaches the old life. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“sublittoral fringe”) and the Treaty’s timeline is cued before transformation; no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the last line re-weights the whole performance/hush dialectic, leaving the cost of perpetual blankness legible. Accumulative lens holds—each narrated chore, new carving, and drone pass thickens the texture until the final image detonates. Causality is tight: because she stays, because she narrates, because she carves, the hush becomes weaponized compliance. The 120-word orientation anchor is met cleanly; no disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of quartz-hum, light-shift, and lake-crack layers density until cobalt glow and moth arrival reconfigure meaning. Closure—Charged Poise—arrives when lantern-moths circle the self-lit atrium: sacred redefined as approachable, cost felt in irreversible exposure. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Single transition (memory shard ≤20 %) is cued by concrete quartz touch. Persistent constraint: poetry ban residual; her voice could still be re-criminalized, a price kept alive in the humming after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is clean: the brass strip’s hot vibration on her eyelids delivers a Decisive Change with unmistakable sensory cost. Causal chain is tight—reed tongue → Theo’s condition → kneel → sight—each beat because/therefore. Orientation locked by line 3; no lens drift. One soft spot: the reed’s “single mournful note” is auditory sleight-of-hand that doesn’t alter tactics; it ornaments rather than tightens. Still, the final image of cracked flames reweights the premise and satisfies the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“she would travel by listening”) and held: each recording station layers density until the lens reweights the stake at the final silence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 and is re-anchored at every shard jump; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell-rings become an infinite, unpaid offering whose cost is felt in her aching arms and the city’s unanswering dark. Persistent constraint—the carbide lens as literal focus—shapes every listening choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the image of Elara descending with fresh vellum while starlight pours through the cracked dome reconfigures meaning—healing is “genuinely artificial” until it becomes real—at visible cost (she still aches, still folds). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane adds density, the stencil’s pattern re-weights at the end. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (observatory, cracked dome, twilight). No meaningful escalation break; the single deepening (teaching others) is sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Marcus’s unscripted draw of the Moon reweights the entire dataset—Vera’s grand taxonomy suddenly includes the very surrender she sought to isolate. Causal lens holds: every measurement is a because/therefore link revealing cultural scripts; the final card is the therefore that cracks her premise. Cost is palpable—her ledger now encodes the failure of control myths she herself exploits. No orientation drift; rain, loft, and body remain spatially stable.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mira walking into night with unfiltered nostalgia re-weights the whole premise—knowledge now means irretrievable transformation. Cost is tangible: archive collapses behind her, its rule-set lost. Causal lens holds: because she embraces chaos-method, therefore she gains unmuted memory and loses the right to return. One microscopic scaffold—“the precise emotion the Netharans had sought to preserve”—is forgivable at this brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the shadow’s metamorphose from devourer to river-keeper reweights the entire premise, cost paid in the stone’s surrender. Causal chain holds throughout: comparison footage → confirms shadow’s autonomy → prompts offering → transforms threat into guardian. Orientation locked by line 10; no lens drift. Final image of darkness “flowing between preserved dreams” crystallizes options and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stripped board and color-shift of the tail shard thickens the betrayal’s weight until the rebuilt frame re-prices her vocation. Closure is a Charged Poise—she pockets the vial, stars fading, future cost palpable. Causality is intact: the detective’s call (off-stage catalyst) triggers the overnight teardown; every splinter removed is a because/therefore response. No orientation debt; mist-skylight-starlight triad is anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: failed surgery → flight → tunnel choice; hourglass sand finally dropping supplies Decisive Change with felt cost (no going back to doctors). Coffee-ring map and plant intel are seeded early; orientation anchors inside 120 words (tower, dawn, hourglass). One causality bump: “the plants know” is asserted rather than demonstrated once, but it pays off when ivy guides the tunnel, so minor.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera realizes the booth is a place to plant, not harvest, and the last image of love “incubating in the dark” crystallizes before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held—density of remembered films, cork-swallowed whispers, hanging strips—until the final cadence shift. Causality is internal but coherent: because each object remembers, therefore the letters must be returned to matter, not taken from it. No orientation debt; spatial and psychic stakes remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: hears stolen dreams → finds collector → releases stardust → village re-awakens. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rusted instrument and falling “first new star” make the cost of her solitude legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal linkage is lyric-loose rather than tight: the anomaly child appears by "wave functions bent wrong," not through Mira’s prior action, so the inciting incident is coincidence, not because/therefore. The midpoint folding scene supplies a decisive micro-turn—Mira actively charms the field—but the mechanism is hand-waved in poetic formula. Closure lands on Earned Stasis: she keeps walking, now carrying the extra branch of possibility; cost is the dune’s dimming flowers, felt but not personal. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pattern break rather than plot-gear turn.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bronze sequoia’s pure note reconfigures Mira’s neural map with undeniable conceptual cost—she will keep translocating without buffer. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift (single sustained note) reweights the dominant stake. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (“translocated again”) pays off at closure. Minor causality gap: the tree’s dying state is intuited instantly with no cue, but the false note is forgivable under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira’s star-punch reclaims deferred courage-flames, reconfiguring her future with undeniable conceptual cost—“no longer leashed, no longer lost.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each star-punch beat deepens the pattern rather than reverses plot, and the final image crystallizes options under twilight vigil rules. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“veiled ridgeway”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the piece teaches its elliptical logic early and pays it off in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is pristine: synesthetic pain → discovery of REMAIN → realization that piano = voice-prison → bolt removal = breach pact; each because/therefore linkage tightens options while the fortress rule remains a persistent constraint. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the instant the bolt begins to turn, silence itself is re-priced—cost shifts from “death by storm” to “death-by-wall if caught,” a felt, legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the genealogy packet placed in the alcove is a Conceptual Repricing that will collapse a dynasty with ink, not war. Causal chain (message → evidence → library drop) holds; the Orientation Test is waived because the library’s folded-time architecture is taught early and pays off in the descent scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the transmitted coordinates rewrite scientific and personal history at visible emotional cost—“trembling hands,” “whatever reckoning it would bring.” The Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of returns, resurfacing data) holds; final image of the fluttering torn atlas page reweights all prior graphs. Causality is tight: grandmother’s hidden barrels → Marina’s misread bleaching → night transmission; no retro-fixes. Orientation anchored by word 78; disorientation serves the emerging oceanic palimpsest.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stones reframe the lull as “breath held before the next note,” making the rebellion’s continuance feel inevitable and costly. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptor layer (rusted cranes, starlight through holes, barefoot cold) deepens the stake until the final image reweights it. Cost is unmistakable—“the cold metal grating beneath her feet no longer felt like discomfort but like connection”—a tangible price paid for the new stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causal breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality holds: because chemical war awakened plant communion, therefore moss→kite→song→seed; the glass dissolving into mineral powder is the visible Decisive Change with conceptual cost—tradition now grafted onto reconstruction concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of coastal garden imagery and trauma callbacks tighten around the final “pearl of stillness.” Closure is Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost felt in the photograph tucked away and the vow to return. Orientation anchored by line 6 (“cliffside gardens…Pacific”). No causality breaks; trauma memory is cued by watering can and hawk, not teleported. Persistent constraint: freeze response remains live, shapes tomorrow’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism-portrait refracts rather than unifies, reweighting her entire artistic rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—she abandons the lucrative single-image market. Accumulative lens holds: salt-light, contracting walls, and layered fragments intensify pattern until the cadence shifts at “prism” declaration. Orientation anchored by word 86 (“Eleanor climbed its spiral staircase anyway”). Persistent constraint—walls that literally tighten—shapes her tactical turn to collage; cost is legible in the final lantern flare that accepts incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the ink’s erasure snaps time back to normal while Seren strides on, hunter now predator of time itself. The “before” (stuck observer) / “after” (active tracker) is legible with felt cost—she forfeits any normal future. Causal linkage is tight: spilled ink → time warp → brother’s death → eleven-year quest → today’s fade-out validates her theory and deepens her trap. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern (ink-recall, wind-erasure) tightens to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens dominates: found letter → secret repair → upload → confrontation. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—“the data packet fragmenting… irreversible” and Vance’s painful grip—so price is on-page. Orientation is clean by sentence 4; timeline tension (“within the blink”) tightens options. One causality seam: Mira’s six-month off-stage repair is told, not shown, but it is motivated and does not break linkage. Closure effect reverberates outward, satisfying RR test.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens: each rose-tending beat thickens the pattern of refusal until the final image crystallizes. Orientation anchored by word 20; no lens drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dome’s “blazing tranquilly” reweights all prior violence, cost legible in the kneeling-on-badge scar and the knife left sheathed. Persistent constraint—the dome’s glass and the sandbag pouch—shape every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the goddess’s whisper re-weights water, stars, and Maren’s vocation in one bone-set line. Causality holds—stillness earned at sea enables the silence that calls the echo; spike translates cost in visible amber grief. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (boots on humming gravel). No teleporting props; zigzag path straightens under cosmic signal, tightening options exactly once. Cost is unmistakable: “I was trying to reach a star” re-prices every future cast of her net.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because the journalist’s call raises doubt, Margaret assumes contradiction, therefore searches, finds the asteroid miss distance, and so decides to soft-lie. Orientation is clean by line 8; the copper dome above clouds is instant anchor. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost—she commits to inherited secrecy, foreclosing full disclosure. Persistent constraint: the burgundy nib she lifts at start is the same tool she writes with at end, making the choice tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the amber cools, the dissonance quiets, and the dawn tastes of forgiveness—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but each added texture (amber warmth, meteor hush, folded hour) intensifies the stake until the final cadence shift releases it. The orientation anchors (who=Vera, where=laboratory, when=the fold) appear within the first 90 words and are re-evoked at the payoff. No plot artifact obscures the emotional causality; the cost is the cooling amber itself—ancient firmware forever still.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative lens holds: mandala, tile, grotto whispers layer density until the silence itself re-weights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mira’s “silence as invitation” reframes the unlearning with felt cost. Orientation is swift: mist, flaking tile, grotto acoustic rules taught by line 6. One causal micro-turn: the tile’s warmth reorients whispers toward her pattern, tightening options without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the renamed stone reweights history itself, social cost unmistakable. Causal chain holds—every vision is triggered by concrete touch, each carving stroke pays forward the soldier’s mercy. Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via repeating object-memory pattern; final image crystallizes options under fractured sky with persistent constraint (regime still rules, stone now waits). No orientation debt, no lens ambiguity; cost legible in the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fractured-timeline device is taught early and pays off in a clear Conceptual Repricing: the orchard becomes a looping stage where every sorrow can be rewound into hope. Closure lands when Madeline accepts perpetual performance as her cost, crystallized in the final sentence “But this… was close enough,” a Charged Poise that reframes centuries of repetition as chosen service. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each echo tightens the emotional stakes until the present woman’s posture shift reweights the ghost’s own eternal script.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The recalled pill, the static shock, and Daniel’s disappearance braid into a single causal spine: the shock rewires the drug, Daniel maps the workaround, Maya follows. Each beat obeys a clear because/therefore: static → somatic markers → hidden wall compartment → journal → proof Daniel lives. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost—she pockets the slivers, paints his name in fire, and forecloses the option to return to ignorance. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“darkened studio”) and never loosens; lens is causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: fossil lifted toward bioluminescent spheres reweights her task and humanity’s place, undeniable cost felt in the hush. Causal chain—fossil warmth → deeper descent → encounter → mutual mapping—holds under inferred Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught by rising thermal/emotional strata. One clean shard; anchors clear by line 3. No meaningful tightening or price after midpoint keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: prophecy flips to seed-manual, cost felt in “steady legs” carrying extinction-level stakes. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of buttons, amber, echoes tightens meaning until constellation pattern reconfigures world-rule. One causal micro-gap: why button constellation = usable map is asserted, not tested, but lyric mode tolerates the leap. Orientation crystal-clear by word 40; no temporal teleporting; single-scene default met.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: snow-melt cipher → dawn walk → sanatorium → acceptance of file, each step a because/therefore linkage. Closure is Earned Stasis: she refuses forgiveness yet carries the betrayal forward, cost legible in the final image of her “carrying the weight.” Orientation is clean by line 6; no teleporting props. The missing beat is the instant she pivots from vengeance to stewardship—summarized, not dramatized, blunting the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the coachman gifts the needle, crystallizing a before/after in their unstated covenant; cost is the relinquished heirloom and the girl’s unknowable future risk. Causality is causal-lite but intact: gutters ceasing → final pull → dock emerges → transfer. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no disorientation. One continuous scene, single POV, one meaningful tightening (gutters silence) satisfies scope default. No lens ambiguity; drive is situational-pressure crystallized into emblematic act.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the disc’s endless kindness-selection re-weights Serin’s craft and life, with cost visible in her laughter that ‘cuts’ the silence. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each sun-pattern, shard of timeline, and clay coil adds density until the final image crystallizes. One micro-turn suffices. The lantern glass is introduced early and paid off cleanly at the climax, satisfying setup obligations.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the reciprocal wave reconfigures both solitude and stewardship with felt vulnerability. Causal chain intact—petal drop → memory → beam → returned gesture—each beat tightens options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; harbor, floor, and midnight are anchored before 120 words. Cost is visible in the held breath and the promise of harder pruning next spring.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine holds: reincarnation memory triggers descent → sundial activates stones → creatures birth → Mira rewrites purpose. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: isolation is reframed as bridge-building with tangible cost (the new manuscript she begins, the sleeping bodies she guards). Orientation is swift—who/where/when fixed by line 3. A modest elasticity: the sundial’s mechanics are stated rather than demonstrated, so the moment of “push” is slightly abstract, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the self-addressed letter dissolves among others, crystallizing her altered stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (lotus, spheres, spiral) reweights the stake of connection. Anchors (who/where/when) are legible within 120 words; no orientation penalty. Cost is legible in the final image; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because she decoded the pattern she could build the counter-transmitter; because she broadcast dissonance the cult falters and the signal fractures. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the “most human sound” of silence reweights all prior static and sets a permanent watch. Cost is felt in the welded door, the 11:58 breaching, and her reflection “not quite earthbound.” No orientation debt; stakes telegraph by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: organ chord sequence → stone panel opens → compass point fits lock → archives open. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: dawn light and distant bells reweight grandmother’s lost years. Persistent constraint—claustrophobia—shapes every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon, once mute evidence, becomes a silent accusation that reweights justice outside statute. Causal chain holds: because Clara cannot recognise, therefore she measures; because she measures, she unifies contradictory witness descriptions; because she unifies, Marcus’s face emerges. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“Clara descended…”), no debt. Lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in the final line: “She had already seen everything she needed to see”—the quarry keeps its silence, but Clara forfeits the luxury of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the satellite-phone image crystallizes a new future with undeniable social cost. Causal lens holds: because Elena coded the truth, because Mira decoded it, therefore Torres acts. One micro-turn—Torres’s face shifting from “skepticism to dread”—tightens stakes without breaking continuity. The 14-month ticking clock is declared, not dramatized, a soft escalation that keeps this from 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the Decisive Change is Margaret’s first physical step off the pullout onto the impossible trail, glass flake warm in palm—an irreversible fork with visible forfeit of her bridge life. Causal chain (question → gift → map → step) holds; scaffold-wrap map is taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the laugh that severs her from the bridge, capping the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: stacked images—circus train, foreign bills, stone markers—accrete until the final quiet re-configuration. Causality is loose (startup fails off-stage) yet pattern holds because the collapse returns Elias to territorial "ground that holds us," delivering a Charged-Poise closure with conceptual cost ("these should travel even if we don't"). Anchor deficit: "Highway 47" appears before place-time is fixed, but the deferral serves the lyrical design, so Orientation Test is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure delivers a crisp Conceptual Repricing—the inscription’s communal burden reweights every prior image—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is legible in Mira’s dawn exhale. One soft patch: the telegram’s “temple inscriptions” cue is unpacked only in exposition blocks, so the causal trigger arrives after the reflective lag, not inside the telescope action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: seed-creates-path → face-melts → reflection returns. The 120-word anchor is clean (island, vortex, seed in hand). Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the mirror now shows her face because she finished the sentence that fear had truncated; the cost is the three years of lifespan already paid and the vortex’s lingering quiet. No teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the door of overlapping shadows crystallizes options—cross collectively or stay rooted—while the price (Mira’s permanent anchoring) is felt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scar-mapping and hedge-rebuilding thickens until the maze reconfigures reality. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cobalt glade at dusk”), well inside the 120-word allowance. Causality is intact: clipping → root growth → maze re-formation → door appearance, each step because/therefore linked.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (descent → offer → acceptance → emergence) links by because/therefore, tightening until the final image reweights “possibility.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—uncertainty becomes the price of self-ownership—and the cost is on-page in the Gardener’s warning and her smile in darkness. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or retro-patches. One meaningful deepening suffices at 735 words.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: viral humiliation → flight to quarry → cloth trigger → recognition of transformed purpose; the Orientation Test is met by word 80; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—‘purpose doesn’t disappear, it transforms’—with the quarry now re-weighted from void to resonant vessel, cost legible in Marcus’s surrendered grip.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the seed-grown fruit makes the physics of transition felt in her mouth, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as pattern—clay, seed, magnetic soil—deepens to cadence shift; orientation is anchored by rung 120; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the eternal present is accepted with conceptual cost (“today held infinite space for wonder”). However, the causal chain is thin—no concrete beat shows smelting altering her next action; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern is legible, but no persistent price (tool damage, social credit, energy drain) shapes the final image. Orientation is clear by line 5; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: shells removed, text sent, option space reconfigured between ex-spouses with the cave’s latent radiance now reframed as possibility rather than dread. Causal chain holds: inspection → discovery → inscription → transmission → reciprocal admission. No orientation drift; transitions tight under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: river/ivy imagery thickens until the final cadence reweights the stake. Anchors (who/when/where) are clear within 50 words; no orientation debt. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: Maren stands on the abandoned platform, accordion exhaling a wounded breath, no longer demanding absolution from outside forces. Cost is felt in the image of taped bellows and the phrase “raw solace,” which crystallizes the new equilibrium. One minor causality fuzz: the graffiti directions are accepted without question, but this does not disturb the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the watch ticks forward, the library accepts her first spoken truth, path foreclosed to silence. Causal chain holds: watch → cipher → shelf → own blank book; propagation-delay rule is taught early and paid off. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“corridors of luminescent shelves”). One soft patch: the “seventeen years” wait is asserted, not dramatized, creating a mild ellipsis that the library immediately justifies; under the accumulative lens this is acceptable, but it keeps the piece from 8+ because the cost is felt conceptually rather than through a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the melted ice-dust constellation reweights ownership itself, felt cost is the forsworn glow and hunted future. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of stain-prophecy, fern-memory, violin-song layers until the dome burst reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and velvet observatory rules stay consistent. No causal breaks; every beat (reading stains, fern counsel, propagate choice) is tethered to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the emerald becomes a portable afterlife, reweighting Mira’s work from cosmetic to sacramental. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each auroral pulse thickens the static until pattern recognition is possible, then the pattern vanishes, leaving the stone as charged residue. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“skyborne grotto suspended among the clouds”) and the dream logic is taught early, waiving any penalty. The final image—“bearing her mother home”—pays the persistent constraint: she must now live carrying the captured frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “receive soul → tend → release → feel warmth” tightens through density, not overt causality. Orientation anchored by line 4; single transition (grotto interior) is legible. Closure is Charged Poise: the final pin-to-heart image reweights the premise—contentment is cyclical tending—and the cost is the unending responsibility she embraces. Persistent constraint: the pin keeps warming, so her labour never ends; that price shapes the final image and is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dawn-to-morning light gradient, chime density, and mirror hollowness accumulate until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “emptiness isn’t always absence… space waiting to be filled differently” conceptually re-prices Sera’s guilt and the keeper’s vocation in one breath. Orientation anchored by word 32 (“the breezy lighthouse at dawn”), causality intact—keeper’s method creates the only “turn” needed. Cost is visible: keeper’s smile is “sincerely insincere,” a performative mask she must keep wearing; the wind-chime quiet after Sera leaves is the unpaid invoice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Elowen delays the revelation, Vara learns the interference pattern; therefore she grasps that a second wave can re-manifest her people. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—Vara sees the cost of reversal encoded in Elowen’s own vanishing youth, and the final image (“she would throw the second stone”) forecloses the path of passive studenthood. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of dust, echo, and bird-flight thickens until the final cadence reweights stillness itself as the decisive change. Orientation is immediate: highest bone tower, dawn, cross-legged woman. Closure—”stop climbing forever”—crystallizes options with undeniable cost; the arrowhead’s transfer is the visible price. No causal breaks; even the wanderer’s arrival is earned by song-echo mechanics seeded early.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each chamber adds density of impossibility until the garden crystallizes the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3 and never loosens. Closure is a Charged Poise—she forgoes extraction and the world reframes value; the cost is the forfeiture of proof in a world that only credits proof. No causal break; ellipsis between stairwell and garden is taught by prior “mist walking” cue.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lantern sky reweights the premise, color-sound synesthesia now forever visible to Marcus alone, cost felt in his isolation. Causal chain holds: key → journal → vial → irreversible perception shift. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Minor ellipsis (how algae keeps air pocket dry) is accepted SF-given; it never resolves the conflict, only decorates. Final image reprises “meteor hush” with new, synesthetic light, satisfying both lens and cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the impossible coins-on-edge crystallize the cost of accepting un-becoming. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each casting thickens pattern until the amber itself re-illuminates. One causality gap: the prophecy’s first arrival is off-stage, so the stakes’ origin is told, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystallized grief array reweights her eternal vocation under a new rule—she will ferry souls while finishing their silences. Causal chain intact: atlas page → scattered sunset → naming ritual → literal crystallization → changed reaper. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Cost is on-page: “she would carry this with her now.” Persistent constraint: glass menagerie she must protect while reaping.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the single drop of sound re-weights cosmic drip rules, felt cost is the lifetime marginalization crystallized in “lukewarm” label now vindicated. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence-density → hairline mapping → drip-cadence shift. Causality intact—bell warmth arises from prolonged handling, not miracle. Orientation anchored by word 60 (viaduct, dawn, Corin center); no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored hush reweights every prior image once Martha says “He left.” Cost is felt—37 yrs of myth dissolve. Causal chain intact: silent chime → photo trail → ticket-window reveal → renunciation of myth. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. No artifact touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty chain and new sight reconfigure stakes with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—pattern density (starlings, crystal, orchard) tightens to a cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. One soft spot: the actual moment of fusion is summarized, not dramatized, slightly blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: mother’s parachute death → Vera’s epistemic humility → refusal to lie → partial evacuation → dawn validation. Closure is Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual doubt as the watcher’s price, re-clasping the buckle only to archive it. Cost is legible in the sunrise line where the parachute metal is held “toward the sunrise” then set aside, foreclosing the comfort of inherited certainty. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: anonymous seed → recognition of titanum identity → symbolic planting → strategic decision to build an “unwinnable” room that bankrupts the buy-out offer. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Vera commits to a slow, immeasurable bloom, accepting financial uncertainty for creative sovereignty; the cost is the surrender of immediate wealth and the acceptance of years of obscurity. One lens (Causal) holds; no orientation debt; the only minor slack is that the actual planting beat is emotionally undersold relative to its symbolic freight.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tunnel converts off-key grief into a charged poise that lets Victor re-enter the world carrying a new silence—one that now has room for future sound. Causal chain holds: because the tunnel macerates song → therefore silence softens → therefore he can phone Margaret; the persistent constraint is the frayed cord he still clutches, its vibration an objective reminder the process is real. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“beneath the abandoned estate”) and the hourglass image signals time. Cost is legible in the final line: “something that had been clenched began to loosen”—physical, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring mist, frost, and whispered books until the pendant’s arrival reframes the garden’s stasis as shared possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maren’s invitation sits in the mist “where light learned to end and begin again,” re-weighting seventeen years of waiting into active guardianship-of-connection. Cost is felt: she risks the only stability she has. Orientation is anchored by sentence 5; no causality gaps; one clean transition from solitude to company.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lattice is immaculate: failed transmutations → distillation of creative-destruction principle → approximation formula → life-essence payment → contract-severing key. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the “frozen bloom” blade crystallizes both option and cost in one image, reweighting empire law without exposition. Orientation anchor (“ember nexus… twilight”) lands at word 18; no debt. The single reflective block (grandfather) is tethered to present object and tilts her risk calculation, satisfying BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she discards filters, the array pulls the cosmic silence inward; therefore she weeps in a reconfigured stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallized in the image of towers that “had finally learned to listen.” Cost is legible in the irrevocable shift from broadcaster to receiver and in the fragment’s warming anonymity. A hairline slip: the phrase “she would find the beginning” projects future certainty, slightly softening the on-page finality required for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: ferry solidifies, Mara remains aboard holding now-star-filled hourglass—her refusal to disembark prices her with eternal repair duty. Lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of phosphorescence / radio voices / stellar reflections accrete until the “up-end” reweights reality. Orientation is taught by word 17 (“the ferry had been vanishing”) and pays off; no penalty. Persistent constraint established: she is the only whole survivor and must repeat the ritual; cost is legible in the closing image. Minor slip: the divergence moment (“choosing left instead of right”) is told in summary rather than shown, preventing a perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Marina ties the last knot and the gallery “settle[s] around her,” reconfiguring both space and identity under her web of sinew. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern repetition of thread, mirror, fever—culminating in a cadence shift where stillness is earned. Cost is palpable: she forfeits the original monumental gallery for a fragile thread-bound micro-cosmos. One minor causality fuzz: the exact mechanism by which thread “negotiates peace” with a sentient building is implied rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chain abandoned under star-geometry re-weights her worldview with undeniable cost. Drive lens is Accumulative—star patterns tighten texture until cadence flips. Orientation is clean by line 5; no caps triggered. Micro-turn at ‘horizons unfold’ narrows options—earned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a credible Earned Stasis: Ruth’s pulse quiets after Margaret’s confession, peace achieved with felt cost (decades of insomnia). Causality is light but coherent under an Accumulative lens—each pulse-strengthening moment follows Margaret’s revealed truth. Orientation anchors within 120 words; single-scene default met. The lens holds, yet the decisive change is Margaret’s, not Vera’s, so the protagonist’s causal footprint remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira surfaces with the codex, but the true gain is the list of names she will carry; the ocean’s “endless hush” makes the cost audible. Causal lattice holds—every body found is a because/therefore payoff to the cable hunt. One tiny orientation waver: “twelve hours between one tidal change and the next” is dropped before we know we’re underwater, but the later image of the tidal window reimburses the debt.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink map and uncounted heartbeats crystallize a before/after with felt cost—she forfeits the numeric shield that kept panic at bay. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ink patterns and heartbeat cadence tighten until silence reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. The only soft spot is the off-stage erasure of the ghost—an external dissolve rather than a final action—but the persistent constraint (she must carry failures as lanterns) is legible in the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (copper pulse, bird algorithm, echo tunnel) deepens the same existential stake—language death—until the final cadence shift reweights it to life. Closure is a Charged Poise: she stands in resonant silence, the cost (shattered diamond, embodied lexicon) legible without exposition. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“entrance to the towers of bone”); no disorientation. One minor causality fuzz: how the copper “intercepts” the curse is stated, not shown, but the image still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of bioluminescent garden, cordless confessions, floating objects tighten the concept of transformation-without-bitterness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren’s ascent carries the arrowhead plus the new editorial stance—visible conceptual cost is the lifelong ridicule she now shoulders. Causality intact: arrowhead warmth → realization Samuel became the cryptid → her alternative metamorphosis into patient witness. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no teleporting props; final image reweights earlier moonpetal levitation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the upward-falling blossoms rewire the orchard’s gravity of control, and the cost is legible in the cracked bridge and the crumbled shell. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via heartbeat code, blossom inversion, statue fracture—until the final image crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. The persistent constraint (soft-volume survival) shapes every tactic and is finally shed on-page, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: “a ghost made of promises” reweights the premise and leaves the cost—perpetual erasure—in the reader’s mind. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of “gaps” and “absences” tightens through recurrence rather than causal chain. One soft spot: the Orientation Test is waived because the twilight/arcade disorientation serves the final ghost-image, yet the phrase “neither the Eastern Authority nor the Western Coalition officially claimed” is the only geopolitical anchor and arrives late (~word 80). No因果 break, but the world-rule for drone sensors is told, not tested on Marcus’s body.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken song becomes continuous practice, the fragment becomes compass, the train becomes home—cost is the open desert left behind. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust, chime, starlight) deepens the stake until silence flips from absence to medium. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“wrong turn off the highway”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the recording cylinder is set before it is used.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical repetitions, wax cylinders humming, spatial “wrongness” deepen the stake until the garden-sky room lands as Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 50; no drift. Closure beat—“began writing in her grandmother’s notebook”—makes conceptual cost legible, though persistent constraint (what she forfeits) is only faintly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sunrise attempt layers density until the fog-morning pattern-break yields the first readable image. Closure is a Charged Poise—Miriam gains a sustainable ritual and teachable stance, foreclosing the option of ever “catching” the dream whole; cost is the permanent distance the photograph confirms. Causality holds: palette → experiments → fog-break → teachable moment. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon’s silvering and Elena’s first word reweight the premise with undeniable social/emotional cost; causal chain (lock of hair ➔ star hint ➔ stone pattern ➔ mother’s rewrite) holds without gaps; persistent price—Mira now carries the terrible secret home—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a charged poise: the new tree rekindles fading colors and Marek forecloses personal rest to keep pruning, cost visible in the mirrored “radiant and hush.” Causal chain—seed needs essence → gathered by witnessing → sapling feeds garden—holds without gaps under a lyrical accumulative lens. Orientation is swift: “verdant parapet beside a waterfall” by ~60 words. Slight reservation: if read strictly under causal rules, the external antagonist (“worlds forgetting how to dream”) stays off-page, nudging it below 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s hands steady as she chooses visible cracks and gold stitching, a visible cost that reconfigures her vocation. The causal chain—shattered masks → silence accrued → net-unravelling as exchange economy → steady hands—remains intact under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of “interlaced hush” inside her chest is the charged poise that makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chapel “begins to whisper” reweights all prior silence and stakes the decision to recommend opening or sealing—cost is the unspoken responsibility Elena now carries. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain/time erosion → pigment loss → map tear → perceptual shift → final poised stance. One scaffold line (“she had come here to interpret silence with empathy”) states motive already shown; otherwise no plot breaks. Orientation is clean by 120 words; transitions are smooth within the single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each artifact (drowned shelves, coral-inked pages, snow-globe storm) layers density until the captain’s pages reweight Eleanor’s premise—letting go is not loss but navigation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the globe sits in her palm, its eternal tempest now re-valued as buoyant, not anchoring. Cost is legible in the final image—“ready to break through”—where surfacing equals exposure to a world that will demand reports, yet she will withhold the private physics she learned. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mosaic of four shards (courtyard → bridge warehouse → monastery stones → descent) is taught by the 25% mark and lands a clean Charged Poise closure: ghost dispersed into her song, Mira committed to covert murals. Causal logic holds: each graffiti find is a because/therefore breadcrumb that narrows her options to “sing or let the code die.” The cost is palpable—she descends alone, voice now encoded into walls nobody is required to read. The bolt-plate reprise in the last paragraph is the visible constraint that forecloses direct speech forever.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is tight: diary → goggles → decrypted instruction → jar release; each step depends on the previous. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by elevator shaft and floor counter within 120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the instant light scatters across Vesper’s face, grief is re-valued as something that must circulate, not be embalmed. Cost is legible: Mira forfeits her anonymous safety and Vesper forfeits her frozen stasis; both pay in exposed vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each newly named cloud adds density until the closing nacreous image reweights the premise—wholeness is solitude completed, not connection restored. The broken tether is the single causal rupture; everything else is pattern-building that pays off when Elena closes her notebook and “speaks back,” a CR with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the phrase “had proven it” claims rather than shows the atmospheric-archive thesis, a micro-tell that keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the condemned oak “finally released” reweights the scholars’ failure as liberation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via nested hollows, carved constellations, and the tactile coin—until the cadence shift at dawn. Causality is present but soft: the coin’s indentations lead her to the book, yet the manuscript’s insight is received, not wrenched. Cost is felt in the “heightened stillness” awaiting demolition, a Charged Poise that forecloses preservation and licenses new sight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery (hopscotch → cipher → coordinates → Luminance) triggers the next action under her agency. Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration—her notes reweight the ship’s purpose—cost is the sleepless night and future debt to proof. Minor waiver: the “someone once believed” backstory is 21 % of word-count, but it tilts her present choice and is repaid at climax, so BRR passes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost, mirrors, gears, and note layer into a cadence shift that reweights “repair” from restoration to transformation. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—mirrors stop fragmenting and reflect only present-wholeness—charged by the sustained note that makes the cost audible. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“Mira pressed her palm…”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. One soft spot: the prophecy scraps arrive late (~550 words) as an expository shortcut, but because they merely corroborate rather than enable the final choice, causality is not broken.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each chalk message layers communal habit until the final exchange crystallizes belonging. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—“I have you. That is enough.”—a quiet renunciation with conceptual cost for the ghost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4. Pressure tightens once: the eastern-grove thirst catalyzes cooperative action. No causal reversals are needed; the pattern’s density reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the clock frozen at 00:00:01 and the inward-beam re-weight the entire premise, showing the cost is her life/epoch. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal, taught early by the nested-patterns talk and paid off when resonance carries the lullaby backward. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are inside 120 words and serve the final image. No lens ambiguity; the hush-pane makes the cost legible on the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal lens is clear: because the blueprint revealed the broken bird-nut link, therefore Maren reactivates it, and the travelers escape. Closure is a Charged Poise—she turns homeward knowing the curse will keep summoning her; the cost is felt in the birds’ first true song and the valley’s “graceless beauty.” Orientation anchors (who, where, frost clock) arrive within 50 words. No teleporting props; the nut’s luminescent mark is foreshadowed by the earlier cellar discovery of the blueprint.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the patent filing crystallizes her new stance—temporary bridges, not cages—with undeniable social cost (she relinquishes the fantasy of undoing loss). Causal lens holds throughout: river-foam epiphany → polymer redesign → patent; no retroactive fixes. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the braided ravine anchors who-where-when and feeds the final image. Persistent constraint (chrysalis on desk) shapes the closing gesture, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of the child writing reconfigures meaning so that “the place where stories begin” becomes the human act, not a location. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is a because/therefore of Vera preparing slates → child appears → story ignites → bracelet dims. Orientation anchored by 120 words (glass orchard library, parole bracelet, Sea of Sorrowing Mist). Cost is legible on the page: the bracelet’s measurable dimming and Vera’s relinquishing of anonymity to welcome the child.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: curse → quest → map-reading → pavilion → selective transfer → restored touch, each step a because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis: she refuses total amnesia, pays with perpetual partial ache yet regains human contact—cost legible in “hands that no longer tremble.” Orientation anchor (fortress courtyard, post-rain, knife) lands by line 4; no penalty. One tightening beat: coral contact shows emptiness risk, forcing surgical second touch that forecloses full abdication.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: a Charged Poise—the elevators now hum in chorus, the town will wake to an acoustic bridge it did not ask for, and Elena’s stance is crystallized with undeniable social cost (she may be dismissed as the “silos’ mad conductor”). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each new language layer thickens the texture until the chord modulates into communal resonance. Orientation is swift (tower, midnight, starlight by line 2); no teleporting props or retroactive rules. One minor causality wobble: we never learn how the municipal power grid or harbor authority allows all-night amplified broadcasts—yet the fabulist contract is taught early enough that the omission does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure intensifies through density of orphaned memories rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 60; spatial logic holds. Closure is a Charged Poise: Vera crystallizes into a lifelong "keeper" of abandoned dreams, cost felt in the image of moon-set mirror still gleaming—an open-ended stasis that reweights all prior strata. No meaningful escalation flaw; accumulation peaks exactly at the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: gravity reasserts, Elara descends, and the new guardian mark is planted—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (she now carries dangerous keys). Causal chain is intact: doodle → phosphorescent ink → grotto → inversion → combinations → guardian seed. Orientation is secured by word 80 (“serpentine grotto,” “seventeen minutes”). No lens ambiguity; the story holds an Accumulative/Textural drive, tightening through pattern reveal rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new bone-conducted music reconfigures community possibility while the silence persists—cost is the permanent privatization of sound. Causal chain (porcelain → crack-reading → inward instrument) holds without gaps; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by word 40. One reflective block stays under 20 % and tilts present action. No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens once when cracks become channels, not endings.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory fragment layers magnetic tension and historical echo until the final Charged Poise—her smile into darkness reconfigures exile from wound to torch. Causality is interior and cumulative rather than event-plot, but the closure beat ("carrying beauty born from exile like a torch against the dark") makes the cost undeniable. No orientation debt; anchors land by line 3 and payoff is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp opens, but the diary is dust, so the Decisive Change is conceptual—Vera’s reframing of secrecy as teacher. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each fork’s hum thickens the texture of silence until forgiveness becomes the only frequency left. Orientation is swift—“the workshop hunched beneath the open sky” anchors who/where in the first sentence; fireworks deadline appears by ~100 words. Closure carries undeniable cost: she pockets the empty clasp, accepting permanent epistemic loss; this persistent constraint shapes her future practice of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: scent-sketches and platform spiral imagery tighten toward the seed transfer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira’s refusal reweights “serenity within motion” with conceptual cost (she leaves the green quiet she coveted). Orientation is clean by word 120. However, the seed itself is causally inert after discovery; no tactic is shaped by it, so cost feels abstract rather than prop-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: water-current navigation → uncharted arch → artifact contact → gravity inversion → knowledge re-pricing. Orientation anchored by 120 wds (who: orchard pilot; where: subterranean river under arch; when: 12-min countdown). Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the grove’s resilience is “grown from what breaks,” reweighting the premise so extraction becomes theft, not salvation. Cost is undeniable—she forfeits the promised cure and leaves her mother’s legacy to an alien soil—rendered in the final image of her seed joining the chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: her refusal to quit is foreclosed by the port’s “breathing” labyrinth and the promise to Vasquez’s children; cost is legible in the final image of her walking alone “before the next silence becomes permanent.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of nightly surveys tightens stakes without causal plot reversals. Minor slip: orientation is complete by line 5, well under the 120-word allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bell’s first toll reweights silence from masterpiece to partnership, and the cost is the amber sheet’s dissolution plus perpetual exile from the pure hush she once worshipped. Causal chain holds: synesthetic gift → read aurora → strike bell → unfetter world, each step because/therefore. Orientation is clean by 120 words (who, where, stakes). One micro-transition (descent) is allowed in a two-shard lyric design; pattern is taught early (“she climbed”) and closure returns to stair descent, completing loop. No teleporting props or knowledge leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the new rule “discord that held worlds apart” reweights every prior keeper song with irrevocable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—because she saw the flaw, she now embraces the forbidden flute and the solitary path. The persistent constraint (she alone must sing dissonance) is legible in the final paragraph. One scaffold only: “She returned the flute… began the long walk down” could compress, but it does not dull the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-loss thickens atmosphere, halo pulses accumulate meaning, and the final page reweights the core equation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mira rewrites her life’s formula into “harmony discovered,” a genuine before/after. A minor orientation wobble: “between vanishing stars” is poetry first, spatial anchor second; still, the pattern pays off when the last star’s blink synchronizes with the press’s cadence, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pendant’s glow and Maren’s steadied steps reconfigure her identity from courier to vessel, cost paid in years of trembling and the absent mentor she’ll never see again. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each monastery stay layers density until the aurora-lit final image crystallizes meaning. The reflective blocks (≈28 %) are anchored to present stimuli (pendant pulse, sky) and tilt her next choice to slow down, satisfying BRR exception. No orientation debt; who/where/when are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the melting frost becomes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her mission from external proof to internal communion, with the felt cost of irreversible evanescence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of frost patterns and prism refractions tighten until meaning crystallizes. Causality is intact: parking in the cold overnight → frost encodes emotion → prism decodes → renunciation of prior goal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mei’s disappearance reweights the premise—family love is literally woven across time—at visible cost (her body gone, only moss letters remain). Causal lens holds: amber bead + puzzle frame + humming edges cause the portal; sacrifice sends the message. Orientation is taught early (bamboo-apple collision, loom lineage by word 80) and pays off in the final image of golden thread vanishing into bead.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blue-forge fire and “neither did he” re-weight the premise—value lies in iterative grafting, not miracle cures. Causal chain (silk → descent → knowledge → blue forge) is tight; each step limits future options and exacts years of labor. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“Veridian-7… floating islands of apple trees”). The only minor drag is a two-sentence paraphrase loop about patience/momentum, but it misses the final beat, leaving closure intact and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: shard glow → locates mother’s footprint → flashback reveals filter purpose → Mira chooses continuation. Orientation clean by word 80. Closure lands with conceptual cost—“anchor...as she learned to fly”—a Resonant Reconfiguration under Causal lens. No prop teleport or knowledge cheats. One minor softness: the mother’s two-decade-earlier timeline isn’t signaled until inside the vision; a quick cue would lock causality earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the sea glass atop the rebuilt cairn crystallizes both literal task (protect) and metaphysical duty (remember), reconfiguring Maren’s identity with undeniable cost—she leaves the lighthouse changed, no longer merely the ferrywoman but the chain’s new vessel. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each letter read thickens the emotional density until the dark lantern room becomes a pressure chamber of shared humanities. Causality is intact: the cairn’s unknown spiral pattern triggers her deduction, which in turn triggers her voice and the final sealing of the envelope. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3 and re-anchored each sensory pass up the stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each descriptive layer thickens the beacon’s charge until the final emerald sweep reconfigures the sky’s relation to land. Closure is a Charged Poise—the beam’s silent covenant with storms—felt cost is the solitude she’ll re-enter at dawn. Orientation anchored by line 5; no causality break. One reflective block (~22 %) stays tethered to present action. Meets 9- gate but minor looseness in middle paragraph keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Senna’s whispered confession reconfigures the meaning of the transplant from mere survival to inherited vocation, and the cost—public exposure of her worst memory—is on the page. Causal linkage holds: the morpho wing → dye master’s recognition → light beam → involuntary confession → decision to stay. Orientation is anchored by word 42 (“The tea house drifted…”) and the floating-stone rules are taught early and paid off at closure. No lens ambiguity; the final image of drifting toward “whatever stories waited” crystallizes the new epistemic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief units accrue, the sextant reassembles, and the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s “thank you” releases fourteen units and crystallizes her new vocation. Cost is on-page: she forfeits the illusion of private grief and accepts perpetual custodianship of shared memory. Orientation is clean by line 5; no因果 turns are required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the price—“she would remember nothing of herself and everything of her people”—is legible, irreversible, and charged by the accumulative pattern of song→mica→web. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and held; the single shard escalates via density shift rather than causal turns, ending in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “absence-as-presence” accrues through catalogued lives and returns in Miriam’s own file. Orientation is swift—Clement Street door, 11:43, no disorientation. Closure is Charged Poise: midnight bell crystallizes her paradox—still hiding, now located; cost is the irreversible visibility inside the Society. Causality inside library remains lightly magical rather than causal, but the effect is taught early and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mei plants the wheat, accepts the burden of memory, and the path forecloses with felt cost (“she only expected to keep asking”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of vanishings intensifies until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by ~120 words; no teleporting props or causality breaks. One reflective block stays under 20 % and tilts present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the library’s total loss is accepted, the slide’s warm pulse against her hip reweights “preservation” into “carried forward memory.” Causal linkage holds: because the star dies, vows dissolve; therefore Elara must measure and choose. The lantern slide’s earlier gift and her remembered warning pay off in the final image, satisfying the persistent-constraint test. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) crystalline library above cloud sea, star collapsing—are clear by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: because father died → truce fragile → must stop recording → intercepts courier → seizes cylinder → drowns it. The sunrise deadline is stated early and honored; spatial choreography across the market is clean. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses the war path by destroying the sound—but the cost is more asserted (“heavy in her pocket”) than felt in a crystallized image. Orientation is secured by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (taste, scent, magnetic taste) thickens the pattern until the empty ring reframes purpose. The brother reveal is causally motivated via forest-weather symbiosis and lands as conceptual repricing—she redefines disappearance as distributed merger. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) secure within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is felt when she tastes “petrichor and possibility,” foreclosing the old search.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two new drawings beside the abandoned canvas visibly reconfigure meaning and carry felt generational cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through repeated sensory returns to violet crystal light and locked-away art until the pattern breaks with the first charcoal stroke. Causality is interior but coherent: grandmother’s lock → father’s prohibition → Maren’s surrender, each cause a psychic inheritance. Orientation is secure by line 4; no ambiguity past midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mei Lin does not confront her dead parents, but her final act re-weights the premise—truth is no longer absolute but curated for mercy. The causal lens holds because every prior breadcrumb (fragmented map, intolerance for lies, father’s recorded plea) renders this acceptance inevitable. Cost is legible in the depleted archive and her trembling hand setting the gold into stone. No teleporting props; the postal fragment’s partial address motivates the floorboard search and the playback station delivers the withheld truth exactly when she is strong enough to bear it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bell’s first truthful peal reconfigures the monks’ seven-year silence and Maren’s vocation into one crystallized image—“the vibrations traveling through her bones”—with the conceptual cost of her permanent voicelessness foreclosed. Causal linkage holds: the iceberg fragment must melt to teach the bronze, so her success is inseparable from its loss. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density tightens once via the kinetic sculpture that refracts frequency, and the final cadence shift from lyrical exposition to wordless vibration lands the RR with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the grain of compressed trauma buried beneath the oldest rose becomes the new before/after, magnetic north restored, static quieted. Causal linkage holds—magnetic shift → sensory migraine → box ignition → miniaturize—but the “why now” of initiating the burn protocol could be one beat sharper. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of iterative tending and containment pays off in the final image of roses breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the hidden key’s reveal re-weights seventeen years of silence into speakable grief under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: locket → Mrs. O → key → mailbox; each step narrows options until dawn listening becomes inevitable. Cost is felt—“she kept the letters”—and constraints (locked box, dawn bench) shape tactics. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 15.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dice click ascent reweights all prior coding, undeniable conceptual cost—stories once encrypted will now surface into uncertain political light. Accumulative lens holds: each danced phrase deepens density until the final image reconfigures stakes. One transition (descent/ascent) is clean; orientation anchors by line 4. No causality breaks, but the missing beat of possible failure keeps it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern’s unnameable colors rewrite the rules of Mira’s universe and her mother’s erasure. Causal chain is tight—coffee pattern → chamber breach → salt key → lantern ignition—each step a because/therefore linkage. One minor bobble: “gravity fluctuated mysteriously” twice in four lines is a loop artifact, but not at closure. Cost is undeniable: the lighthouse door seals behind her, excising her from the town’s ledger exactly as her mother was.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical shard layers silence-density until the final Charged Poise re-weights the prophecy from certainty to possibility. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 10; the 120-word test passes. Closure lands with conceptual cost—millions wake from nightmare into uncertainty—visible in the softened paper wing. However, the cost to Mira herself is only lightly hinted (trembling fingers); a sharper personal price would secure 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the narrator assumes the tutor mantle with the same opening line Elara used, crystallizing the before/after of inheritance. Cost is felt in the image of sugar stocks “no reasonable person needs” and the building’s expectant sigh—conceptual price of eternal custodianship. Accumulative lens holds: patterned tea/meteor/sugar cadence deepens to final reprise. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 4. Causality intact: because narrator listened, therefore building chose; because Elara faded, narrator remains—no reversals needed under lyric-accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: steal shell → speak memories → wild resonance broadcast → Elena’s voice returns. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Mirabel relinquishes the need to be remembered, accepting she may never receive reciprocity. The “velvet garden” and shell mechanics are taught early enough; spatial orientation is secure. One minor causality gap: how the stolen half-shell can “receive” Mirabel’s new memories is asserted, not grounded in the established tech rule-set, but the lyric leap is acceptable under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: the key’s impossible lock is taught as metaphor; its crumbling at the exact beat the treaty is completed is a Decisive Change that unlinks Aldric from failure. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“marble sanctuary,” “aurora,” “Veren dipped”). Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost: the forger’s life’s work dissolves into dust, peace is retroactively declared, and the stalactites keep dripping—earned stasis with felt price. No timeline or prop drift; every object (thorn, ink, key) is present and tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: silence chosen, path foreclosed, canyon’s hunger denied. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sung echo extracts another sliver of self, and the final withholding reweights the pattern. Cost is legible in the final two sentences (“the serpentine nexus groaned… she did not look back”), though the earlier teleport from revelation to decision remains abrupt. Orientation is anchored by word 80, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira steps “into the waiting dark” cradling the globe, Elise steps through behind her—an irreversible reconfiguration of the veil. Causal chain holds: snow globe residue → dream pattern decode → harbormaster guilt → public exposure decision, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation anchored by line 3, no debt. The single soft spot: the lighthouse sabotage is inferred rather than dramatized, so the social cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on-page—barely short of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rain-soft return confirms her covenant with unseen labor, reweighting her decades of secrecy. Causality is accumulative/textural: the whisk, whistle, and moon paths layer until the final conducting image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean by line 9; no lens ambiguity. Minor drag: the “demure audacity” label arrives late and slightly summarizes the beat that should externalize the contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: orchard survival → shredded letters → stillpoint → diamond → departure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; the orchard’s impossibility is the inciting image. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she exits the safe stillpoint to broadcast proof—paid off in the final line “watch what grew.” One causality hiccup: the Geiger counter “falling silent” is told, not shown as a sensory beat, slightly dulling the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: because she hoards extinction signals, therefore she denies blessing and redirects followers upward, narrowing her solitude into communal risk. Closure is resonant reconfiguration—her reflection re-seen as “woman made of weather and regret” now welcomes ascent; cost is foreclosed seclusion. Orientation clean by line 3; portico, storm, radio anchor who/where/when. No teleporting props; transmitter choice logically follows archive of ghost broadcasts. Single tightening beat: assault call → refusal → invitation; escalation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus returns Samuel to the wind, re-weighting the stake from possession to release. Causality is intact across the two shards (loft → beach walk) and orientation anchors arrive by line 5; the only mild slippage is the off-stage grandson promise acting as initial catalyst without on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: discovery ➔ skiff commandeer ➔ resonance entry ➔ molecular unmaking, each step a therefore linkage. Orientation anchors—who (engineer Vera), where (drift-ice marina), when (twenty-minute sunset window)—arrive before 120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the Tone’s global release reweights the premise—absolution is now atmospheric and un-commodifiable, paid for by her corporeal erasure. Persistent constraint: only her key + lineage can open, only her body can become conduit; both shape tactics to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed maps foreclose her exile and crystallize the coming blindness of the Empire. Causal chain—measurements → storm → unyoking—is legible and goal-driven; the viaduct amplification is set up and paid off. One soft spot: the “three-month” storm timing is told, not shown, slightly blunting cost immediacy, but the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: David’s notes → sealed tunnel → lantern → contraband → resolution to expose. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—Margaret’s silent promise to the lantern reweights every prior beat with conceptual cost. The only drag is a 150-word reflective block that stalls forward pressure just before the alcove discovery; a micro-ellipsis would have tightened the ascent to the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the repaired music box begins to play off-stage while Marcus composes a letter about unearnable grace, reweighting the premise that forgiveness must be “earned.” The cost is the ghost-note inside the melody and the visible price of a week-long wait with a letter that can never reach Elias. The causal chain (testimony → imprisonment → gift → repair → letter) holds without gaps; the storm-cloud light break is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: kaleidoscope visions → transliterating → launch. Closure is a clean CR: the bell, once unheard, is now “listening,” reweighting the world-rule with conceptual cost. Orientation rock-solid by 50 words, no prop teleport. Minor: off-page acid physics could tighten, but it doesn’t breach causality or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: 7-14 pings → Helena breaches vault → warehouse clue → midnight run, each beat foreclosing safer paths. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her sprint crystallizes new hunter/hunted stance; cost is felt—“she began to run.” Minor scaffold (“numbers started appearing…”) and a late patch reveal qualify but don’t sabotage the last image; the before/after pivot is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens: mirrored glimpses build density until the crystal reconstitutes, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kira’s inclusion in her own circle of care. Causality holds: fragment warms → mirrors show → crystal fuses → stance shifts. Keeper’s off-stage knowledge is the one soft pivot, but the final image (“shadows trailing like loyal hounds”) crystallizes cost under the inferred lens. Closure is on-page and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each frozen detail layers patience until the final “fold between intentions” crystallizes the reconfiguration. The lacework tip’s return in the last paragraph reweights the premise without causal reversal. No orientation debt; place, time, and POV anchor within 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cost is the suspended future, felt in the body leaning into the marina’s groan.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sharing of burned fragments crystallizes a new intersubjective stance under Accumulative/Textural lens—leaf-fall density and amber light reweight stakes rather than causal plot. Orientation clear by line 8; no penalties. Persistent constraint: eleven-year vigil and empty buses visibly shape tactics and final image. Cost is felt in Marcus’s admission “waiting for buses that stopped carrying anyone I recognized.” The ending image of “fragments between them” reconfigures meaning without sentimentality; lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: prophet’s threat → descent to parapet → transfer → consecration → safe murmurs. The conjured clearing is foreshadowed by the humming marble and kinetic parapet, so the final sealing lands as earned Decisive Change with conceptual cost (ancestral voices now exiled to an invisible sanctuary). One minor loop: “the line walker understood” restates keeper’s stakes without new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: because/therefore linkage runs through each photograph session, tightening communal stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sweeping mosaic reconfigures what “reaching” means for the entire village, cost felt in the unspoken absence of the one future photo still waiting. Persistent constraint—the map case always traveling—shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; time/place anchors arrive early and cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each crystal echo thickens the texture of linguistic loss; the final image of nameless spectrum colors re-weights the premise with conceptual cost—dictionaries are obsolete yet meaning can still branch. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara stays, options crystallize, cost legible in the “solitary faith” scattering across notebooks. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored within 60 words; no ambiguity at payoff. Pattern is taught early and paid off; no loops or telegraphing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chalk map of future partings reweights the premise—knowledge itself becomes unbearable—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. The driftwood trail and dissolving fog teach the pattern early; orientation is never in doubt. Cost is legible in the final image of the phone photo already corrupting, proving the rule that prophecy erases itself. No causal break or soft reset mars the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative lens holds: each image (spinning hand, trembling foundations, silver leaf) layers density until the final stillness reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“stillness isn’t death, it’s arrival”—with visible cost: Mira accepts her father’s perpetual absence and relinquishes the need to fix the hand. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the final image crystallizes the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each lyrical catalog and shard-fitting beat thickens the stake of “how to face death” until the golden-veined record crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift—hospice above clouds, blood-work pending—within 60 words. Causality is lyrically associative rather than plot-reversing, but the final image of joined hands plus scented hope reweights options with undeniable cost, satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is legible: bent reality → key found → automaton awakened → sealing runes performed → shadows return. Orientation lands within 80 words and telescopes are pointed at “spaces between stars,” a quick, world-defining image. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Mira now shoulders a guardian role—but the price is asserted (“she would be ready”) rather than dramatized in a beat of forfeiture or fear. One minor causality fuzz: automaton claims “timing requires precision,” yet no on-page mis-timing risk or deadline ever constrains her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: Eleanor buries her skepticism and takes the path of search, with the felt price of never again enjoying the safety of disbelief. Causal chain holds: tooth → dig → hollow bones → vow; each step narrows options. Lens is Causal; “because/therefore” linkage is intact and rewarded at the end when the garden’s laughter confirms the world-rule she has just accepted. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“the hedge maze had grown wild…”), well inside the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each polished piece adds refractive density until the spiral becomes a communal beacon; the grotto’s mist is the textural carrier that multiplies light. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—when Maren sees “cold light, gentle as a zephyr bloom,” the rule-set flips from fire-based sharing to glass-based sharing; the cost is her acceptance of perpetual gentleness instead of consuming blaze. Orientation inside 120 words: serpentine grotto / forty years later / dusk. No lens ambiguity; all prior beats feed the final reweighting. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves the spiral behind, exits “into the darkening world,” surrendering sole custodianship of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pendant hand-off crystallizes forgiveness inside the moss garden, reconfiguring their stance with felt quiet cost. Causal lens holds—Mira’s earlier pattern noticing motivates the offering, and Thea’s presence is the because/therefore result of viral fallout. Orientation is clean by word 80. Minor slip: “the honeyed hush absorbed their words” is abstract; the beat would sharpen if the space physically constrained them (echo, dampness). Still, the image reweights prior motifs and meets the 9− gate for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the mist recedes only after Elena whispers into the shell, making the act’s cost legible. Causal chain holds—each cameo delivers a because/therefore rebuke that narrows her options until she accepts vulnerability. Orientation is complete by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end. One transition (mist → desk) is signalled by “When she opened her eyes,” keeping mosaic legible.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vine pulses green, Mira accepts incremental cost, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of song/light reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no causal breaks. The persistent constraint (“next harvest, she would bring others”) is legible in the final image. The -0.4 gap to 9.0 owes to modest escalation: one intensification rather than a tightening sequence that forecloses a second path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens holds: each discarded fragment added to the spiral tightens the ritual density until starlight drop becomes the inevitable cadence shift. Orientation is swift—crater, frost, skeletal trees by word 30—and the final image (warm copper, distant heart redirecting) delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. No causal reversals are required; the pattern’s saturation is the escalation. Closure beat is the warm plate against her palm—tactile repricing that makes the map real.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the timer expires, the marble sings, Elena records the harvest—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration of her available wonder. Causality is intact: every gear she files and angle she maps feeds the final alignment of light, stone, and sound. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of observation and pattern-break of the first audible harvest carry the stakes. Cost is legible in the "returning silence" and the notebook of transcriptions that will forever separate her from pure mystery; no slips touch the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the exchange of accumulated burdens for a self-boundary is legible and charged. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of echoed griefs increases until the cadence shifts at dawn. Causality holds: because she absorbs each sorrow-thread, therefore the fractal gains weight and she gains edges. The single-scene orientation is anchored by word 70; no debt is triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return (kettle pitch, rain code, wood grain) thickens the same dominant stake—how to contain absence—until the final cup-steam image crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: options narrow to “enough,” cost felt in the ache of joints, the rough unfinished lion. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words. Micro-turn at “Perhaps this was enough” re-weights prior repetitions without causal break.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s spoken admission dissolves the ghost and reweights her future options while the frozen carousel persists as visible cost. Causal linkage holds: because she finally voices the fear-driven erosion, the ghost can relinquish its claim. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words (who, where, when). No lens ambiguity; the piece ends under a causal lens. One minor loop: “perpetual motion” is repeated twice in close succession, but it does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, dripping water, frozen boards accrete until the 30% viability equation breaks the pattern and reweights possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks toward the transport with “next equation” in mind; the terminal’s dark patience is the felt cost. One micro-drag: “functionally creative decision” repeats twice in 50 words; trimming one would tighten the cadence and push 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of quiet imagery (rain, crystals, sunrise) builds until the silence-break decision lands as Charged Poise. Closure beat—“notes would remain silent for now, but not forever”—is on-page, legible cost (half-life spent, vulnerability reopened). No causality break; ellipsis between Silencing news and dawn choice is motivated by her prior ritual visits. Orientation clean: who/where/when planted by word 40.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each artifact salvaged tightens the pattern until the letter reweights the father’s mythology with criminal evidence, the final image of the dark dial crystallizing conceptual cost. Anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 7 and again at engine cut, comfortably inside the 120-word window, so no orientation penalty applies. One shard (twilight canal) flows continuously to closure; no mosaic pattern is taught, so single-scene default is met. The closing beat satisfies CR: the useless dial’s extinction re-prices “time reveals what intention conceals,” making silence itself the inherited instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative lens holds: each knot adds density until the final pattern crystallizes an invitation, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—the hidden weavers endure only if a new listener keeps decoding. Causality is clean (rope → knowledge → next step) and orientation is swift; the only minor slack is the off-stage “test” that never jeopardizes her path, so the tightening is intellectual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pages placed beneath the stone plus the thread in the braid reconfigure absence as artifact, not wound, with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory fragment—maple leaves “the color of dried blood,” loosening weft—intensifies the dominant stake until the final object reprices it. No causal break; every beat is a therefore/because of ritual repetition narrowing to this last obituary. Cost is legible in the finger-groove the thread has cut, paid on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: forbidden archives → egg → Resonance Reconstruction → flawed birth; each “because” tightens options until copper birds stutter. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—palace sways, citizens scream-laugh, Aldric tastes salt. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The final image of “living heart finally remembering rhythm” reweights the rule-set, meeting Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/texture lens holds: black sand, coin, obsidian, and cloud migration accrete until the final image reweights “fire” from wound to song. One legible shard-transition (lagoon → city apartment) is cued by “Tonight she would graft…” Closure is Charged Poise: the jar click reconfigures her options, cost legible in the warmth against her hip. No orientation debt; early anchors (radio silent, obsidian lagoon, cloud season) land by line 60.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain is clear: frozen geese → breadcrumb crystals → key → laughter solvent → fountains restored. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: communal memory regained at the price of Mira’s private relic, signaled by the empty box. Orientation anchors arrive by line 4; no penalty. One meaningful tightening at the amber spiral suffices, though escalation is gentle rather than fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: gear encodes resonance → sonar teaches reception → Veloris transmits → garden re-broadcasts; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (light without fire now possible) with cosmic-scale cost. One soft spot: the “pattern-break” moment is compressed into a single paragraph rather than a dramatized beat, so the tightening feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dusk visit layers sensory and emotional density until the final sketch reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—constellation sketch + ribbon tie—that makes collective grief visible without tidy resolution; cost is the forfeiture of solo names. One transition (greenhouse → home) is legible; pattern of dusk returns taught early. External causality is loose but permissible under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the pendulum resumes, the rake handle leaves, and Maren’s stance is crystallized—she will keep winding, the cost is perpetual vigilance. Causality is flawless: the late chime caused deaths → guilt → nightly climb → found handle → inscription → release → restored temporal duty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each accurate chime adds a grain to the moral balance. The broken rake handle’s return is set up by tide pools and earlier “mirrors of seawater,” so no teleport. Cost is felt in the final line—“seventeen seconds resting lighter” shows the weight she still carries.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the coordinates rewire the past fifteen years of gardening into an active next move, a conceptual repricing with felt legacy-cost. Causal chain holds—letter → tapestry → decoding → cemetery—each step contiguous; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (cobalt silo ladder) and the single transition (climb → platform) is legible. The story’s slight lack of pressure or risk keeps it shy of 9.0, but the reconfiguration is undeniably on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because she maps ignorance, she dreads authoring truth; therefore she writes invitation, not prophecy. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses certainty, carries maps down spire; cost is the weight of “humility enough” on the final line. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the moment quill meets page narrows infinite possibility to committed lines.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each broadcast thickens the communal “dust” layer until the final crystallization that “the story famine was ending.” Closure is a Charged Poise: dawn reveals no seized equipment, yet the invisible network now exists, reweighting Helena’s solitude with irrevocable responsibility. Cost is legible in the blanket-drawn vigil and tomorrow’s already-forming script—an ongoing endangerment rather than a single sacrifice. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no temporal or spatial ambiguity persists.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mingled ashes settling into the floorboards reweights the gallery’s impossible horizon, making grandmother part of the vanishing point itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (dust motes, mask warmth, rocking-chair rhythm) deepens the stake until the final scatter crystallizes the new state with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sedimentary layer adds a competing epistemic frame until the final cache-seal reweights the whole cultural archive. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus’s empty satchel and forbidden calendar date visibly foreclose the path of public argument, leaving only subterranean memory-work. Cost is legible in the same beat. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no ambiguity at end, so lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because the program is silenced, therefore Margaret sits in resigned stillness; because Darius enters with reclaimed memory, therefore the silence is broken. Closure is a Decisive Change—the first sounded note—with felt cost: the imperfection acknowledges ongoing fragility. Orientation anchored by word 60; no set-up violations. One tautening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harvested fruits and neuron-etched tastes crystallize a future path with palpable regime risk. Causal chain holds: seed → moonlight → synaptic bloom → harvest → city-bound insurgency; each step tightens stakes under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by ~120 w (“rusted greenhouse stood…”). The “because” of memory-fruit growth is lyrical, but moon-alignment rule is taught early and paid off; cost is legible in dawn’s inevitable crackdown.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bees re-sync while Mira accepts the matchbox’s transfer, proving wonder can outlive power. Causality holds under an accumulative lens—each storm-echo in the tower’s memory literally re-weights the present stakes. The only drag is a 150-word expository pocket that slows ascent to the climax; trimming it would tighten the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the house’s “exhale” reweights the premise—attention, not ritual, sanctifies. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of displaced objects and accumulating hush tightens once, then crystallizes in the final image. Causality is intact, cost is felt in the shard’s mingled scent, and the ending reconfigures meaning without tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the ampoule's light reweights "death" from tragedy to reunion, crystallizing the new rule-set on-page ("death was not an ending but a returning") with undeniable conceptual cost for the living. The causal spine holds: brother extracted → Veris waits → Mira arrives → knowledge transferred → choice foreclosed. Orientation is anchored within 30 words and the single transition is legible. Cost is visible in Veris's stone grinding and Mira's vertigo; no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crack seals with her on the “other side,” grief-engine now internalized, cost felt in the warmer stone and smoother die. Causal chain holds: dice roll → 8th step → crack → chalk-proof → rupture → sealed passage. Infinite-stair rule-set stays consistent; no teleporting props. Orientation anchor (who/where) is clear by line 3; the mild initial disorientation (time has no meaning) is taught and pays off thematically, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: moonlight and brushstrokes accrue a density of proof that reweights the premise. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed within the first 60 words; orientation is never in debt. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the moon-tipped brush glowing “steady and sure” reconfigures insomnia from curse to gift and makes the conceptual cost undeniable. No meaningful escalation flaws; causality is maintained through moon-timed painting sessions and email arrival without coincidence resolving the core want.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the bread-letters become sacred relics, the waterfall’s song reconfigured from prison to guardian. Causality holds—because the beekeeper stays away, therefore Mira re-casts the custom as resistance, and the lens re-weights its meaning in the final beat. The lens ambiguity test is passed; the accumulative pattern (absence → bread → lens → laughter) is taught by 25 % and lands with felt cost. A hairline slip: “three seasons since his last visit” is the first temporal anchor, arriving after the 120-word orientation window, but the disorientation is later paid off by the thaw metaphor, so only a −0.1 internal deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands clean: the counter-clockwise beam drags him bodily through a door that forecloses return, a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—each backward gear in the yoyo pays forward to the lighthouse lens reversal—so the lens (Causal) holds. The missing orientation debt is waived because disorientation (“spiraled wrong”) is the pattern taught early and paid off at exit. Only nit: the seventeen-year corpse is never inspected or causal, a faint Chekhov-dust bunny that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: drowning → fear nest → advisor’s paradoxical method → dream confrontation → consumption. The opera clasp and dictionary are seeded early and return reweighted: clasp gleams post-victory, mirrors add one more smiling face. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Vera’s chest is emptied but her mouth tastes of ash, the funhouse gains her triumph—so cost is on-page. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Single-scene default met; transition is internal dream logic, taught by the dictionary instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers sensory refrains (clouds, salt-creak, struck wood) until the final “one note at a time” crystallizes the reframing of wreckage into music. Orientation is swift and anchored in the body at the orchard’s edge; transitions are unnecessary in this single drifting shard. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, cost felt in the perpetual drift—earned by the iterative dubbing pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: because the gate is corroded shut, escape is impossible until Mira’s body-and-shell leverage cracks it open; because the watchers tilt, the whistle-note is proved efficacious, justifying the boat. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—she is physically outside the gate, city shrinking behind, cost paid in blood-on-rust and permanent exile. The “crack in the world” foreshadowing pays off conceptually rather than literally, acceptable under lyric-causal hybrid lens. Orientation is anchored within five lines (who, where, when), so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snow-covered tracks reweight her irreversible act with solemn cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact: petal drop → upload → truth release. One minor scaffold: “comfortable fiction continued its comfortable work” is a paraphrase loop, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact layers absence until the photograph-letter convergence reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—Marina’s archive now contains E.M.’s split story, cost felt in “almost unbearable” negative space. One soft spot: causality nevertests her surveyor skills; the floods stay scenic. Still, the final image of moon-set wade home crystallizes stakes with elegiac cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: blackout → silence → hidden compartment → ledger discovery → identity recognition → new index entry. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stamp’s meaning flips, giving Maren a new genealogical self-definition and a public act (updating registry) that costs her prior neutrality. The ledger reveal is the visible cost—handling centuries-old proof that implicates her own profession—but the price feels intellectual rather than visceral. Orientation is secure; lens holds; minor slack in that the ledger coincidence could have been seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: cranes → lantern design → basilica theft → midnight capture. The lantern’s activation beat delivers a decisive change with visible cost (Mei on knees, lantern glowing with “luminous torment”). One reflective block (Lin’s fall) is anchored to present paper cue and tilts the next choice; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the spike on the readout reconfigures meaning—her map of unspent futures is growing, the price being perpetual pursuit. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds; each cooling cycle and failed overload is a because/therefore stitch pressuring her to keep computing. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. The only drag is a 23-word reflective block (lines 29-32) that summarises therapist language already shown through embodied memory; it does not break escalation but does keep the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the dome-crack lens projects a living map, conceptually repricing the quest from finding a person to joining a network; the cost is the open road she now must walk. Causal chain is intact: chip fit → lever pull → star-beam map → next coordinates. Orientation is swift: who/where/when locked by line 12. The lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the broken watch hand in wooden fingers reweights the entire premise under an Accumulative lens. Causality is intact—every driftwood fragment she fingers is a because leading to the therefore of public confession. The reflective block is anchored to present stimuli (the tide line, the carving) and tilts her stance via micro-choice (speaking aloud). No orientation debt; cobalt terrace and dusk are fixed by line 3, letter trigger by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: brother’s error → negotiation → synchronized moonlit exchange → earned silence on the stairs. Orientation is secured within 120 words (who, where, when). Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drawer-pull returned to pocket, the mist erasing footprints—cost legible in the final image. One minor slack: Varen’s “grave error” line restates stakes already known, but it doesn’t break escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the utility-pole map, fog-softened shoreline, and broken compass accrete into a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena’s Charged Poise on the eighth pole where “home” is re-defined as forward motion, not safe harbor. Causality holds: each pole is a micro-beat that visibly tightens her stance; the compass’s uselessness is re-priced as “beloved” rather than discarded, paying off the engraved North Star cue. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable: the eternal uncertainty about Marcus’s death is accepted on-page (“the cruellest part”) and carried forward.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: breadcrumb newspaper code → lake → baseball → tunnel choice, each “therefore” narrowing options. Closure is Charged Poise: algae glow confirms inner truth, foreclosing retreat while future promise hangs undecided; cost is legible in cold water and irrevocable first step. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; 2089 date is the sole causal perturbation but is later justified by time-travel rule. No loops, no soft resets—pressure compounds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s new wings crystallize the cost of reunion while the fortune paper dissolves, charging the final image. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—scent density, moonlight pattern, and feather cadence tighten until options reweight. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“The orchard had bloomed…”), satisfying the single-scene window. Persistent constraint (loss of humanness) shapes the final stance, meeting the 9+ quick test, but a hairline slip of fortune-cookie “prophecy” telos keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the card-door swings, she drinks the firefly moments, and the cracked saucer glows—cost is the visible cord she forever surrenders. Causal linkage holds: because she climbs → finds glade → breathes on cards → unfastens lock → recovers time. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One transition (dawn descent) is legible; mosaic pattern taught early via card ritual. Accum/Textural lens holds; density tightens once when moments pour back into her.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hundredth tear opens a dimension whose possibility is reweighted by Mei Lin’s integrated shadow, not by machinery. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each crystalline tear adds density until the pattern ruptures—and the final image of the dissolving door crystallizes that cadence shift with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“recycled spaceship drifted”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. No causal break: the tears’ power is established through successive beats, not retroactive rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellation disperses, re-weighting the premise from capture to surrender with undeniable felt cost (heat-drained sand, vanished trail). Accumulative lens holds: each jar cracked open tightens the pattern toward release rather than causal reversal. Orientation is swift—black sand, volcano whisper, Jupiter-Saturn dance anchor by line 4. No plot amnesia; the geologist’s detour reroutes but does not resolve the ritual—agency remains Miriam’s.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is crisp: quill-holder numbers → sundial angles → evidence packets → engineered blackout → messengers galloping through gates Maren unlocked. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the revolution is now unstoppable yet her own life is frozen in renewed servitude; the cost is felt in the image of her returning to post with keys that no longer protect the Duke. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (Eastern Gate, twilight, Maren on duty). The only mild lag is a mid-section expository block (~160 words) that summarizes three months of decoding; because it feeds directly into the causal payoff, the lag is tolerable and does not break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starlit cataloguing sessions accrue density until the final image reweights the stake—“the resistance blooms in fractures.” Causality is present (coffee-tin smuggling enables the library’s survival) but the primary drive is pattern-deepening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: options crystallize in the last paragraph where patrols seek threats, not poetry, and the cost—perpetual vulnerability while preserving literature—is unmistakable. The orientation anchor arrives early (“Mira discovered this place three years ago”) and the single time-skip to present night keeps temporal footing clear.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens: projector → hidden frames → tonal beacon → airship arrival forms a clean because/therefore chain. The closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (broken clock face cracks, time restarts). Orientation anchored by 50 words; no causality breaks.

Dream mechanics are seeded early (“another method…predated reality checking”) and paid off in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lace tableau crystallizes reconciliation with felt cost—the years lost cannot be undone. Causal lens holds: because grandmother wove the lace, therefore Mei can now read it; because Mei reads it, therefore silence cracks. Cost is visible in the “raw and relieved” collapse. No orientation drift; timeline anchored by tide post-storm.
