  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Aris's shift from observer to participant carries visible cost in abandoning his detached worldview. The butterfly dust lens device effectively structures the accumulative revelation, and orientation anchors (greenhouse, post-flood, scientist) establish clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelen seals the ledger in glass, transforming both terror and wisdom into art—a clear before/after with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres as frost patterns reveal the smugglers' cipher. Slight dock for the smugglers' arrival feeling underdeveloped, but the lens holds and closure lands powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through color-emotion synesthesia that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where trauma transforms into beauty. The cost is legible in "deep exhaustion settling into her bones" and the emotional price of confronting the capsize memory. Orientation anchors (conservatory, post-silence world) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from package to library to resolution, with the lens serving as the crucial linking device. The closure lands as a Decisive Change - Elias transforms from tormented receiver to active resolver of spiritual distress, with clear cost (his life's exhaustion). The "occupying impossible spaces" ability feels slightly convenient but is adequately costly ("immense cost").

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building from anonymous donations through bell discovery to public declaration and garden creation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the community transforms from passive recipients to active builders. The bell functions as the critical turning point that reweights all prior gifts from charity to solidarity. Cost is visible in the risk of exposure and the physical labor of breaking hard ground after decades of decline.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where unused love transforms into "the light for other things to grow by," with felt emotional cost in Elara's tears. The accumulative breathing pattern builds coherently toward this revelation. The piece teaches its lyric mode early and pays it off through the kwan yin's tear's luminescence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Elias breaks the fragment's hold but pays with total memory loss, creating a clear before/after. The accumulative pattern of memory dissolution builds through concrete images (mother's hand, drafting pen, wife's laughter) toward the final crystallized moment where "every memory perfectly clear, sharp, and whole. Then, they all vanished at once." The cost is unmistakable in "He felt no memories, no past, no name."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as mechanical details and sensory chaos build toward Elara's Earned Stasis—accepting continued bondage while achieving her true purpose of protecting future life. The closure lands with felt cost ("Her body was bound, but her purpose was now free") as she forecloses personal freedom for collective survival. Who/where/when anchored early through the chain, prize center, and falling Divider Wall.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias creates the hearing aid that contains not the pain itself but "the shape of its absence," fundamentally reweighting his relationship to trauma. The accumulative structure coheres as collected silences compress into the crystal, with clear cost in "the sonic signature of a human heart cleaving in two."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Silas's entire worldview reweights from capturing past to holding future, with clear cost ("he did not know if he could ever believe his eyes again"). The accumulative structure coheres through light imagery (golden-hour to moonlight) and the flower code system establishes causality early. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where abandoning the glass sphere and fleeing with only Leo's bookmark fundamentally reweights her relationship to grief—from frozen preservation to flowing acceptance. The structural integrity failure creates genuine urgency that forces this choice, with clear cost in leaving her unfinished lens behind.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Decisive Change closure where Leo transforms from victim to victor using the failsafe code, with clear cost (accepting his constructed nature). Causal chain holds: shell whispers → library search → cast discovery → decryption → trap. Minor orientation delay but pays off. The "architect of his downfall" reversal lands with Julian's terror as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Kaelen completes his ritual cycle with "his quiet obsession sated for another cycle," accepting the endless nature of his task. The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through layered descriptions of silence types. Deduction for the relatively low dramatic cost; while philosophical weight exists, the emotional or physical price remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Unit 734's discovery reweights its entire existence—thoughts aren't logical constructs but emotional echoes. The causal chain from observation to hypothesis to direct interface is clear, with visible cost in the system warnings bypassed. The temporal loop mechanics are well-established early and pay off through the "ghost impressions" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the lens exchange - a crystallized moment where understanding replaces mistrust with visible cost (tears, vulnerability). The accumulative pattern of tickets-to-understanding holds throughout. Slight deduction for the explanatory line about "confessions of a grief" which tells rather than trusts the image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the butterflies' arrival proves Elias's thesis with visible cost (his tenure at stake). The causal lens holds throughout with strong because/therefore linkage from secret healing to present method. The final marble-cracking crystallizes victory's price and reweights the collection's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens building to a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's worldview fundamentally shifts from linear to lateral time. The cost is existential vertigo and the loss of singular identity ("multitudes"), landing with genuine conceptual weight in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where water transforms the program into readable music, paying off the setup perfectly. The cost is visible—the "ruined, transformed artifact" that Elias must preserve in a sleeve. The accumulative lens holds as water imagery builds from "dark mirror" to "water damage creating images" to final dissolution that reveals the ghost's message.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's acceptance of ambiguity becomes "the atmosphere she now breathed." The cost is palpable: she must forever hold two incompatible versions of Liam, unable to grieve either fully. The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and the final image of "equal and opposing pressures."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure as protagonist transforms from passive guilt to active intervention, earning self-knowledge through helping ghosts. Causal chain holds: confession → seeking weight in abandoned places → hearing sounds → investigating → solving spectral crisis. Cost is visible in "bone-deep, earned exhaustion" and the acknowledged burden that remains but can now be carried.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the narrator accepts the temporary nature of peace while knowing "the peace would crumble again." The origami swan serves as a consistent mechanism for the transition. The cost is felt in the acknowledgment of inevitable return to duty. Slight deduction for the transition sequence being somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the eclipse's stages paralleling Lena's emotional journey. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena sees the curl "not just as what she lost, but as proof of what she'd had," with the cost visible in her "tear-streaked face" and sixty years of defining sorrow. The eclipse functions as both literal event and structural device that enables the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's discovery that humanity's loss of imagination stemmed from Earth's axial displacement severing the "tether to the dreaming-well." The accumulative structure builds through diary fragments toward the revelation that Elara deliberately burned evidence of this loss as "intellectual mercy," with Kaelen accepting his limited role. Cost is legible in the "profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze" and his inability to restore what was lost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with fortune cookies accumulating toward the exchange and Elias's departure as Resonant Reconfiguration—his leaving reweights his entire orchestration role with felt cost of abandoning his life's work. The microdot specs cleverly embedded in cookie glaze provides strong causality. Slight deduction for the exchange scene being observed at distance rather than dramatized with full immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with sonic layering building to conceptual repricing—the entity retreats when its philosophy is "refuted by perspective." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Cost is conceptual but legible in the entity's forced retreat and Elara's return.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Kaelen's homesickness transforms from pain to foundational note - he learns time's music rather than conquering it, with visible cost in his exhaustion. The accumulative structure coheres through memory-mapping toward the dawn's mirrored horizon payoff. Deduction for slightly abstract middle section that delays concrete anchoring of the method's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Kael accepts the source memory and becomes whole again, with the cost being his unique ability to defy gravity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through pattern recognition and deepening understanding rather than causal events, culminating in a reweighting of his fractured existence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where shared vibration transforms collective numbness into "resonant heart of the earth itself," with visible emotional cost paid through tears and physical responses. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through vibration descriptions toward final reconfiguration. The transformation from "mirrored hush" to filled, warm silence shows legible before/after with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain from feeling watched → finding injured pigeon → decoding weather data → recognizing underground route creates solid because/therefore linkage. The closure achieves Charged Poise as Elias commits to investigating "the storm-that-wasn't," with cost implied through abandoning his safe solitude. The piece teaches its conceit early (weather data as navigation) and pays it off through the ventilation shaft revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design builds through sensory details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts grief rather than resisting it. The UV revelation of "Somniflora" creates causal linkage between Elara's secret perfume and the extinct flower, paying off the setup cleanly. Cost is unmistakable in the final tears as "tribute" and "acceptance," with the transformation metaphor linking flower and emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern observation building to Elias's conceptual repricing of the Lumin's binary choice. The closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias crystallizes his stance to "remain the poet" and "stand in the doorway," with the cost being perpetual threshold existence. The rope functions as a persistent constraint linking past escape to present choice, and orientation anchors establish clearly by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: "The hush was not broken; it had been given a voice" transforms the chronic silence from absence to presence, with the water drop in the bowl as tangible proof of completion. The accumulative structure coheres as each musical interaction builds toward this reconfigured relationship with silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered sensory detail toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael accepting the emotional residue as his burden. Cost is explicit: "leaving the sorrow behind as a residue in his own soul." Orientation anchors (amber grotto, Kael, fragrance work) establish by ~50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong causal closure with Elias's grant establishment as a Decisive Change that pays visible emotional cost through Alina's "stunned, radiant gratitude." The because/therefore chain from mistaken envelope to correspondence to meeting to revelation to action is exemplary. The "cycle of compassion" conceptually reweights all prior material with clear cost - David's death inspiring ongoing support.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Kaelen moves from separation to integration, with visible cost in his abandonment of solitary art for communal service. The accumulative structure builds through crystalline orchard → search → discovery → offering → acceptance, each beat deepening his connection. The polishing cloth invitation crystallizes his transformation with felt cost as "the two halves of his world become one."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern break (three-beat waltz disrupted) driving escalation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias learns "the echo's birthplace was the brief, terrifying silence." The pendant's revelation as "a tuning fork for time" enables the resolution causally. Cost is visible through the city's near-destruction and the Chronovore's dissolution. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay regarding the giant's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the light projection transforms grief from "formless specter" to nameable structure. The cost is felt through the "jagged edges" being "slowly smoothed" and the acceptance that loss is "not gone" but given "context and definition." The accumulative lens holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Anya's moment of "profound and bewildered gratitude"—a Resonant Reconfiguration where hope replaces despair with visible cost (her academic ruin transformed). The tape fragment accumulates meaning from obsolete trash to family lifeline, with Elias's invisibility as the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's shift from forcing repair to clearing wreckage, with visible cost in releasing his identity as controller. The accumulative lens holds as pattern recognition builds from storm damage through vine behavior to personal application.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias shifts from extracting meaning from landscape to receiving it through human exchange—"holding the grain, not the chaff." The accumulative lens holds as details layer (roots/drone/amber) toward the exchange that reweights his artistic purpose. Cost is visible in giving up the found object for intangible story.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Lyra accepts her "obsolescence" and loses her clairvoyance, with cost visible in "for the first time, she felt no need to know what would happen next." The accumulative/textural lens holds through shadow communications and crystalline disruptions building to transformation. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through tide rhythms and fragment accumulation toward the resonant reconfiguration when the woman recognizes her husband's valve. Cost is visible in her "trembling finger" and the "failed heroism" revelation, though the closure could land harder. The piece teaches its pattern early through Kaelen's methodical collecting and pays it off when a single object transforms into human story.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from dare to discovery to transformation, with the phantom punch as persistent constraint. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias becoming keeper) with visible cost (giving up his cartographer life). Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence in the fortress - truths appear conveniently organized rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Elias experiences his grandmother's memories and creates "the very thing he'd set out to build: a sanctuary of memory." The cost is visible in his transformation from skeptic to someone who accepts connection beyond rational explanation. The accumulative structure coheres as whale songs, storm patterns, and the magic square converge to unlock the memories.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Xylos crosses the threshold into absolute unknowing, with clear cost in abandoning his sanctuary to be "unmade by the storm." The accumulative build from boredom through spatial manipulation to final crossing coheres well. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain from father's past crime through Elara's atonement plan to successful escape, with cycloid diagram confirming closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost - Elara commits fraud to balance fraud. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the final paper that *becomes* the story rather than telling it. The cost is palpable—Elara's solitary work against three years of silence, creating histories for a world that may never read them. The piece teaches its pattern early (lamp harmonics → texture capture) and pays it off through the transformed paper.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with density increase through layered stories culminating in the phantom memory formation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the layered emotions briefly coalesce around the poison label, creating "a memory, textured and sharp." Cost is felt in the immediate dissolution ("shattering the illusion") and the return to solitude. Orientation anchors (port, containers, narrator's status) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change when the ephemeral compass manifests and points to the floor, revealing Thorne's true discovery. The cost is legible - Elias faces a "possibly lifelong" task with no public validation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure lands with visible cost under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's intervention reweights the Revel's chaos into hidden order, with clear cost ("hadn't saved the Revel from changing"). The causal chain from problem through graffiti-encoded reorganization to inspector confusion lands cleanly. Slight deduction for marginally late orientation of the Consortium threat's specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through ritual preparation, chemical timing, and photographic documentation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where beauty and extinction converge. The Silene Flora's sublimation under sunlight delivers visible cost—"The magic was gone"—while Kaelen's internalized "beautiful ache" provides felt cost that reweights his purposeful curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the repaired drone enables the ship's departure, with cost implied through the urgency and precision required. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor dock for cost being more implied than visceral at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively when the frost map appears and Elias realizes the convergence is "not a place to be found, but a phenomenon to be witnessed." The accumulative structure builds through layered details toward this crystallized moment. Cost is conceptual—his life's work as a static mapper becomes "a joke told by the universe."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through rhythmic layering of footsteps that resurrect spectral echoes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence transforms from empty to "filled with promise." The ebony tuning fork anchoring the town's "true pitch" into the ground creates visible cost through permanent commitment. Structure coheres around the single walking circuit with clear who/where/when anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts death as companion to achievement, with unmistakable cost (life itself). The accumulative lens holds as sensory/psychic density increases toward the crystallized final moment. The "who/where/when" anchors establish clearly by line 3. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "gathered hush" concept early on.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from inherited disbelief through discovery to accepted martyrdom. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—breaking the seal transforms the suspended moment into mundane death while cementing the narrator's role as truth-teller who won't be believed. Cost is visible in the final paragraph's acceptance of disbelief. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph 2 to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from glimpses to full manifestation. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration as the knowledge transfer completes and Lyra dissolves, with clear cost in their "lost life." The orientation anchors (greenhouse, winter, Elian) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the labyrinth transforms from "tomb" to "cradle" through collective unconscious weaving made permanent by Kaelen's conscious intervention. The cost is visible (bleeding hands, risk of erasure) but the causality between sleepwalking discovery and conscious action could be tighter. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through wandering, discovery, and reconstruction to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ship carving reweights the journey metaphor with felt cost. The "hollow space inside her begin to fill" and acceptance of questions over answers delivers closure with emotional price paid through generational loss.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure through Charged Poise - the sealed letter represents crystallized options with felt cost ("the faint taste of adhesive on his tongue a grounding, human sensation"). The accumulative structure coheres as chalk codes build toward the letter's physical manifestation. Slight weakness in cost visibility - while the stakes are clear, the personal price Kaelen pays remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates as details cohere into conspiracy recognition, with closure landing as Charged Poise—message sent, outcome uncertain, cost visible in waiting. The orientation anchors clearly (observatory, Elara, autumn), and causality holds through pattern recognition rather than event chains, though the cost could be more visceral at the transmission moment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Kael achieves "shattering understanding of why he had taken it" with clear emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres as spirit voices, condensation messages, and memory fragments build toward the revelation "a surplus of fear" that reframes his past choice. Orientation anchors established early (mangrove labyrinth, stilt-hut, Elara as medium).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the General's recognition of shared vulnerability forecloses his armored stance, with cost visible in his swallow and gesture shift. The accumulative lens holds as Elias builds meaning through translating symbols into emotional truths that reweight the conflict's scale. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the coral fragment effectively anchors Elias's motivation without excess backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with clear cost—"not the boisterous glee of the past, but the gentle, bittersweet warmth of holding it close for just a moment" makes the before/after legible. The accumulative structure builds effectively through the light-painting process. Deduction for the slightly mechanical transition from daydream to reality in the final paragraph, though the cost remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each nested awakening deepening Elias's understanding until the Conceptual Repricing at closure—his choice to abandon certainty for "something that rings." The hobo nickel's transformation from skeletal landscape to perfect mirror tracks this journey, and the cost is legible in his rejection of "predictable cerulean" for the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from wilting sunflower discovery → greenhouse meeting → seed deployment with clear Decisive Change at closure. The psychic network buckling creates visible cost through the "profound and glorious silence." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early through garden setting and Synaptic Census worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's relationship to pain transforms, creating new art that affects distant listeners. The closure lands with felt cost as she enshrines the postcard "in the very heart" of her shell, foreclosing her pattern of hiding poems. The transformation is legible and paid for through centuries of vigil, though the middle section's reflection on pain's texture shifting "like sand grinding into a pearl" could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where lighting the orchid crystallizes the cost of preservation - "another piece of the world below lost forever." The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and the "beautiful, toxic sadness" that builds to the final act. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the symphony of truth transforms silence into "fragile, resonant chord of hope" with visible cost (blood-ink binding, risk of shattering). The glass ink well's transformation from "cruel joke" to "transparent promise finally fulfilled" charges the ending. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the extinct language's binding properties.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: envelope adhesive → chain cipher → hidden letters → transformed understanding. The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing where "Duty and love were not conflicting values" reweights the entire premise with visible emotional cost. The revelation that his father chose apparent coldness to protect his family creates a clear before/after with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's gift to Anna crystallizes his shift from guarding to sharing, with visible emotional cost in "his voice raw." The accumulative structure coheres through repeated rituals (balancing, tea visits, storytelling) that reweight at the end. The orientation anchors (bookshop attic, courier pigeon trainer) land within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building to Charged Poise closure—Elian choosing the terms of his distance. The wooden grain analysis reveals spatial sheer symbols that predict the threshold's formation, creating causal linkage. Cost is felt through the "fundamental rule" vibration and acceptance of permanent separation. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchoring of the fractured reality concept.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward the light-jelly revelation that reconfigures both characters' relationship to the dying station. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Kaelen finds belonging through shared wonder, with the cost being acceptance of loss rather than replacement. The orientation anchors (deep-sea facility, Kaelen as landscape astrologer, transport deadline) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - a Conceptual Repricing where Kael's understanding shifts from "interrupted journey" to "purposeful destination." The revelation that the traveler chose transformation carries conceptual cost (becoming glass). The because/therefore chain from glass to seeds to vines to final understanding is clean. Minor deduction for the traveler's story being somewhat abstracted rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mural's illumination reweights the entire arcade space through orchestrated physics. The cost is subtly felt through Kael's ephemeral art that dissolves immediately, leaving only phantom warmth. The chain of causality from channel to coin-pusher to light beam is meticulously traced.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - the permanent cosmic verse on skin represents irreversible transformation from remembering to being. The accumulative lens holds as patterns (gaps, silence, dance) build toward the charged final image where "obsidian grace was no longer just in his motion, but etched into his very skin."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Silas's understanding shifts from capturing light in "static form" to embracing "ceaseless, elegant flow." The cost is palpable - losing his life's work - and the accumulative lens holds throughout. The stone-throwing divination scene effectively bridges reflection to revelation, though the transition could be slightly tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the box's transformation from rescued object to "fractured relic of a price willingly paid," with visible cost in Elias's scars. The accumulative lens holds as the box accumulates meaning through reflection. Slight dock for heavy reliance on backstory (~25%) though it actively charges the present frame.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the gauge settling at a "significantly and stably higher" reading after Elara's pattern succeeds. The cost is legible in the "equation had been spent" and the implication of repeated failures ("last attempt, which had caused a brief, violent spike"). The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains causality as the tide activates her pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Decisive Change: Kaelen reverses his artistic trajectory, choosing to create a response piece that offers "the possibility that an ending is never truly the end." The cost is his abandonment of pure artistic detachment. However, the change feels slightly intellectual rather than viscerally dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when the last butterfly passes through.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory fragments and dream-visions build pressure toward Kael's transformation. The closure—gaining present awareness by consuming the seal just as the bunker collapses—delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost: he loses his fractured sight to gain true presence while drowning. The "path grows its walker" revelation reweights the entire custodian lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kavi's discovery of the hidden star-cloud, with clear cost in his "lifetime of thrift...spent in a single, glorious act."

The cost manifests in his transformed state: "disquiet...now illuminated by the stark beauty," showing he cannot unknow this burden.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from absence-research through botanical discovery to successful negotiation, with the Curators' acceptance creating a Resonant Reconfiguration. The "unheard symphony swelled... rising to a grand, hopeful crescendo" charges the closure with felt cost ("weight of all possible futures on her shoulders").

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from entry to resolution, with the ruby placement creating a Decisive Change that cancels the purge. Cost is visible (millennium of cultural memory at stake). The revelation that the throne needs its "heart" not a ruler lands with conceptual weight. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical exposition of the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Liam's ability to breathe again marks a decisive internal shift with felt cost (his weeks of suffocation, her six months of isolation). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from ash to starlight to shared memory to breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias shifts from trying to understand broken systems to witnessing the "ultimate broken clock." The accumulative lens holds as cogs build to discovery to philosophical transformation. Cost is legible in his abandonment of his life's purpose. Slight deduction for the philosophical abstraction in "become part of the question" rather than more concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens builds density through layered imagery (lighthouse/lens/painting/ship) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the painting's correction releases the trapped history. Cost lands explicitly: "the long moment between their then and my now had finally, mercifully, come to an end" shows temporal and emotional weight. The lens fragment's transformation from "heavy" to "lighter" physicalizes the change.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Leo repairs "a crack in the veil" with visible cost (the ghost's release). The causal lens holds throughout with strong because/therefore linkage from power cut → ghost appearance → ceiling investigation → mainspring discovery. The "moment of choice" fulcrum and the ghost's tethering to an incomplete task create meaningful pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the frost-patterns building toward a Conceptual Repricing where "perfect system" dissolves into "potential." The rupture sequence delivers visible cost through the library's transformation from static perfection to uncertain possibility, with the new glass trees bearing "closed buds pulsing with soft, internal light" marking irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara leaves the compass and walks away empty-handed, her relationship to collection "fundamentally, and beautifully, rearranged." The cost is palpable—she abandons her defining practice. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain: found slide → projection reveals covenant → pattern saves her from wave. The closure (Decisive Change from artist to custodian of ancient knowledge) lands with clear cost - she must rebuild a disconnected world. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the convenient timing of the wave's arrival just as she finishes viewing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's understanding reweights her artistic practice and inherited passion.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Kaelen shifts from passive grief to active creation, with clear cost in his exhaustion ("profound exhaustion of a god on the second day"). The accumulative structure builds through memory fragments to lantern illuminations. However, the Djinn backstory remains slightly abstract, and the calamity's specifics could strengthen the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Elian's discovery leads to his decision to "make a whole city forget how to feel," a Decisive Change that forecloses his life's purpose with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara discovers borrowed time's texture as "cool, living water flowing over ancient, unmoving stone" with clear cost (the egg's hatching threatens erasure).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through resonance tracking that pays off when Elian diverts power to harmonize rather than suppress.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elias creates a "silent, cerulean guardian" for his first protected truth. The accumulative texture—from truffle hunting through storm-battered orchard to the glass eye ritual—coheres perfectly at closure when "It is peaceful here" becomes both true and incomplete. Cost is unmistakable: three kilos of truffles and accepting permanent isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas's act of preserving the boutonnière transforms both men's isolation into "witnessed and shared" connection—clear before/after with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Aris lighting the lantern and understanding her father—"she had widened her perspective, not by abandoning her logic, but by learning where it had to end." The accumulative structure coheres as each scrawl builds toward this crystallized understanding. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the caller's understanding shifts from ending to beginning, with clear emotional cost in his initial despair. The accumulative structure builds through repeated loops and the glass harmonica's punctuation, teaching its pattern early and paying off when the caller adopts Silas's framework. The orientation anchors (subway tunnel, phone booth operator) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building from walnut-stained fingers through chemical restoration to phosphorescent blooms, with each detail reweighting the central discovery. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the restored photo transforms both archivists' understanding and the jetty literally blooms in response, making the cost of "generations who had lived and died by a lie" undeniable. The miraculous blooming strains credibility slightly but functions within the story's lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas shifts from puppeteer to participant, with visible cost in his acknowledgment "still lonely, but for the first time in a long time, he was not alone." The causal chain from rumor-seeding to community formation holds, though the transition from hesitant strangers to collaborative builders feels slightly compressed. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the station gathering density of human connection.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—Kaelen discovers the Stillpoint isn't absence but unification, transforming his understanding of both grief and silence. The cost is felt in "its sharp edges smoothed into a bearable, known shape." The accumulative structure builds through collected musical notes to this crystallized moment of reconfigured meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelen's unbending represents acceptance with visible cost—the permanent loss of those lives he cannot save. The temporal anomaly discovery escalates meaningfully through testing edits that reveal cascading disasters. Minor deduction for the orientation taking slightly long to establish the gravitational anomaly's specific nature.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through mapping different silences until the climactic disruption at the ferry landing creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—the harbor's silence transforms into "unending song." The cost is felt in "the sorrow of their loss and the joy of their music resting together in his heart." The orientation anchors (who, where, when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through layered discoveries (tapestry, carvings, constellation, vandalized portrait) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen's purpose transforms from revenge to creation. The cost is legible in his shift from "arsonist who had destroyed" to "curator of a true one," though the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with drumming patterns building to create the visual manifestation of their shared dream—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in "the space beside her where Leo should have been." The closure lands powerfully with "playing a duet for one" crystallizing both achievement and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage from storm-disabled systems to manual navigation to cipher-key solution. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Silas proves his methods' superiority, with social/professional cost visible in Kaelen's deflation. Orientation anchored cleanly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for cost being primarily external rather than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the darkness acknowledges the light with "soft luminescence" - a genuine exchange with felt cost (loneliness eased). The pattern-teaching through shutter manipulation coheres well. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya's thought "I can draw that" crystallizes the shift from resignation to curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with Kaelen raising Aethelburg and accepting separation from Elara - a Decisive Change with visible cost in her "tender, aching acceptance." The scrimshaw-as-key setup pays off cleanly when its vibration severs the island's tethers. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final beat mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through performed narration, whittling, and the final placement of the bird in Mara's bouquet—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The piece teaches its pattern early (theatrical narration as shield) and pays it off when the performance ends. Slight deduction for the marginally abstract phrasing of "remade hush" which could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Kael's understanding transforms from seeking to decode chaos into recognizing kinship with the colonnade as "fellow creator." The cost is subtly present in his physical shivering and the implicit risk of the banned space. Who/where/when anchored clearly by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra awakens after the perfect sound is offered, with visible cost (Elian's recognition that helping create life, not painting it, is his masterpiece). Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from Elian's perception to solution to sacrifice. Orientation anchored early (painter, post-phoenix world, glassblower's courtyard).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final bell's transformation from sound to light reweights the entire carillon's purpose with clear cost—the abandonment of traditional sonic connection. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this conceptual shift. The "golden shadows of loss" becoming "golden light of rediscovered truth" provides visible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres well through the origami-message pattern building to shared constellation projection - a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (Anya's death transformed into teaching). Minor orientation weakness: the woman's arrival context could be clearer earlier, though the pattern teaches itself effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through the card-by-card mapping to Julian's recognition of being "a single data point in a vast, cyclical equation"—a clear Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The father's revelation deepens stakes midway. Slight deduction as the cost could be more viscerally embodied in Julian's final response.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage from discovery of "purify" command through unpatterned ritual to absorption of the An-Korin. The closure lands with unmistakable cost - Elara becomes "both resurrected and entombed" with the civilization inside her. The revelation about the An-Korin's fate (perfecting nostalgia until they ceased) directly causes and explains Elara's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong causal chain from discovery of corruption through diagnosis to integration, with clear closure as Kael successfully restores Elara's archive by accepting rather than erasing her trauma. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - "The regret was a permanent resident in his heart" - though the transformation could be more viscerally dramatized. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's reformed convictions, with visible cost in his betrayal and loss. The accumulative structure coheres well through the shedding metaphor. Deduction for the cost being more told than dramatized—we hear about the "ransacked nursery" but don't see the immediate stakes of his choice to help rather than pursue justice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands clearly: Elias realizes his search for closure perpetuates wounds, reframing himself as archivist rather than healer. The cost is palpable in the "heavier" meteor hush and his lonely acceptance, though the coffee-ring tunneling sequence briefly strains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure: unused love isn't stored but absorbed into place itself. The psychometric vision builds causally from touch to scent to full reconstruction. Cost is felt in Arthur's unrequited devotion and the "melancholic melody" that persists. The accumulative lens holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing when Elara reconceptualizes human suffering as "lament of forgotten stardust," transforming her relationship to her affliction with clear cost—years of isolation. The accumulative structure builds through astronomical observation to cosmic insight, though the revelation paragraph relies slightly on telling rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the crystalline pine tree synthesizes past and present with clear cost - the violation of Kaelen's dreamless state. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the final transformation, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the protagonist reframes his condition from curse to participation in "a grand, logical process." The cost is accepting loss of control over his physical location. The accumulative lens holds as sensory patterns (wind sounds, the hum) build toward this insight. Slight deduction for abstract phrasing around the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's understanding of courage transforms from something to be found to something to be enacted, with the cost visible in "every step that followed." The accumulative structure builds through the vigil, the guides' arrival, the journey, and the threshold moment. The orientation anchors (twilight, stone, morning's severing) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands powerfully through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias places the bolt beside the teacup, making his culpability visible with clear emotional cost ("something fragile had begun to thaw").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael and library dissolve after fulfilling their purpose, with visible cost (his existence ends). The accumulative structure builds coherently through cryptic messages → gathered energy → iron pellet → rune activation → unraveling. Who/where/when anchored immediately ("Kael, a titan... Athenaeum of Lost Moments").

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration: the reef's temporal return transforms Aris from drifting to moored-with-purpose, with visible cost (years of isolation). The accumulative structure coheres through rhythmic patterns building to the revelation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed cost articulation—the "periodically eternal" concept could land harder in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the hum transforms from personal discovery to planetary signal, with clear cost ("The lull was over"). The hybrid lens holds as causal discovery shifts to accumulative resonance, and orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: finding the kite script leads to understanding via plant telepathy, which enables the unsealing ritual. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when the embryo transforms from stasis to active growth, with the cost being permanent alteration of the reconstruction's foundation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis—Anya's choice to continue caring for the trees despite triggered trauma forecloses the path of surrender with clear cost. The accumulative build from present calm through triggered memory to grounded return works cohesively. The final image of giving "just enough" water resonates as both literal care and metaphor for measured hope.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the lighthouse's circular compression and culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms breakdown into method. The closure lands with felt cost ("years" of quiet, the "luminescent ache" transformed but not erased) and the final image of climbing "back up into the light" reweights his descent as necessary navigation rather than collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through sensory intensification and pattern-based magic culminating in Kael's disappearance—a Decisive Change with clear cost (abandoning his kin during crisis). The disappearing ink sequence builds density through fractal geometry and quantum threading. Minor deduction for slight ambiguity in the "between" space description at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Decisive Change through Elara's irreversible act of releasing the letter, with clear causal linkage from discovery to decision to action. Cost is visible in her "profound betrayal" and the violent story "about to be written" on the peaceful world, though the closure could be strengthened by showing more immediate consequence beyond waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis through the sheathing - a refusal that forecloses violence with visible cost ("coffin for a future she would not entertain"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from tending roses to confronting legacy, with the final image of the "perfect, living testament" reweighting all prior cultivation as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when Kaelen voices silence through the rail spike, creating "a form made of starlight and absence" - a Charged Poise moment with clear conceptual cost ("the world's frantic patterns began to heal themselves"). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation could anchor "when" more precisely early on.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from journalist's accusation through Celeste's systematic proof by contradiction to the revelation about the uncle. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—her father's lifelong sacrifice now legible. The "painful orbit complete" effectively reweights the opening's astronomical metaphor with earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where guilt transforms to "memorial, not of guilt, but of a connection finally made peaceful" with visible cost paid through the etching ritual. The accumulative structure coheres as memory fragments build toward the laboratory confrontation. Slight opacity in the timeline between past tragedy and present, but the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the mandala's creation shifting the grotto's atmosphere from isolation to "fragile, shared focus." The cost is legible in the surrender of verbal communication for visual expression. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the final beat could sharpen the precise nature of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's systematic erasure and rebuilding of identity, with clear cost in both the Retro's lost memories and Kaelen's accumulated burden. The causal lens holds as each action—finding the tessera, activating the stone, channeling energy, renaming—builds toward the transformation, though the world-building mechanics could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Julian layering sensory echoes (1958 sunlight, 1980s laughter, 1962 Moon-Blossoms, his own applause) to transform Elara's despair. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara pockets the coin without flipping it and walks "purposefully" away, with the Chronos blossom marking Julian's satisfied "encore." Cost is visible in the "spectral energy" Julian pours out and Elara's transformation from "crying softly" to newfound purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through two light-painting experiments that reweight the central question of connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when they "devise their own perfect, irrefutable language" with visible emotional cost ("willowglass hope"). The static shock memory and grandfather's funeral create causal linkage that narrows Elias's skepticism into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara literally becomes the cave's voice through levitation and consciousness merger. The cost is felt through physical transformation and the weight of becoming "first speaker" of an ancient language. The elm fossil effectively bridges analytical/mystical states throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story delivers a Decisive Change when Kaelen chooses not to turn the hourglass, breaking the cycle with clear cost—the city's time has run out. The accumulative/textural lens holds as each catalogued button unscrambles the prophecy's voices, building to the revelation that changes Kaelen's understanding from inevitability to choice. The closure lands with felt weight as he steps "out from beneath the cliffs and into the dawn" carrying the map of possibilities rather than accepting doom.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change lands with visible cost - Elias moves from paralyzed guilt to active pursuit, with the Vienna failure explicitly reweighted as "a fracture in their shared world that he now had the chance to mend." The causal lens holds throughout with strong because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors arrive promptly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's understanding of his broken promise transforms from failure into "quiet, persistent compassion." The accumulative structure works well, with sensory details building toward insight. However, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral—we understand rather than feel the thirty years of carrying this burden. The orientation anchors (coachman, river crossing, fog) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the thrum intensifying through acts of care. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelen understands the oasis persists through "accumulated weight of gentle history," with visible cost in his forgetting food/night to rebuild. The pattern teaches early through glass visions and pays off when kindness anchors the place to eternity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the nightly ritual building density toward Mr. Henderson's window opening—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in Elara's exhaustion and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael accepts his role as "not a relic but a reservoir," with clear cost in accepting eternal isolation. The accumulative structure builds through memory fragments toward this crystallized stance. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "reincarnation memory" concept which could use more grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's act of adding the twig transforms her isolation into connection with visible emotional cost. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and builds density through layered contributions to the installation. The cost is legible in her terror at giving away "her last link" and the peace that follows demonstrates genuine transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change: Elara activates her counter-frequency and observes immediate effects as protesters lower signs and confusion replaces fury. The cost is legible—exhausted ache, ongoing vigilance required—and the lens holds as Causal throughout. The closure lands with "she would be here tomorrow night, and the night after, ready," showing both victory and ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from entering the nexus through organ activation to the compass point's resonance achieving spatial stability - each action necessitates the next. The closure lands with visible cost (claustrophobia endured, risk taken) and decisive change (chaos to stability, hidden knowledge revealed), though the final revelation of blueprints rather than a physical key feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's empathy awakens "not by a face, but by the true and terrible shape of its absence" - the cost is felt in his "sharp, aching sorrow." The accumulative structure coheres through consistent opposition-unifying that builds to the decisive scratch. Orientation is clear by ~100 words (quarry, Elias, cold case investigation through art).

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal linkage drives the plot: discovery of journals leads to decoding poems, which reveals location, which uncovers truth, which enables reversal of exile. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost—Eva's century of erasure and Elias's inherited burden. The reversible exile concept effectively reframes the entire narrative from failure to conspiracy, though the magical "cartographical curse" mechanism strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully - Elias's shift from playing "lonely tunes" to attempting to decode reality's secret language represents genuine transformation with clear cost (abandoning his known world). The accumulative structure builds through observation, revelation, and active choice, with the glass shard providing crucial physical proof that prevents this from being mere delusion.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's understanding that "all paths of ravenous hunger...eventually consumed themselves," with visible cost in the startup's bankruptcy and implicit cost in Elias's chosen isolation. The accumulative structure builds through territorial markers toward this crystallization. Minor deduction for the slightly over-explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elian transforms the burden from personal curse to shared cosmic sorrow, with visible emotional cost ("frantic energy...subsided"). The stellar dream sequence effectively bridges temple glyphs to cosmic message, and the final reweighting of the telegram from "curse" to "promise" lands with earned resonance. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "healing" mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from ritual to branch discovery to unbending to confession release. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with emotional cost as Elara's guarded heart "begins to unbend." The orientation anchors solidly (cursed lake, Elara, present-day after the failed trick). Slight deduction for the confession's content being somewhat predictable given the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara discovers not a destination but "a vector to be created," fundamentally reweighting her approach from searching to building. The cost is felt through Kael's psychic prison and the decade of root-binding, though the final paragraph could sharpen the immediate price of this discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain from bargain to void to active repair, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the burned card transforms from penance to guardian. Cost is visible in the sacrificed memory and ongoing commitment. The piece teaches its metaphysical rules early and pays them off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from seeing the quarry as "a wound" to "just a place...longing for a new sound," with the grille cloth's placement representing acceptance rather than disposal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory memories cascade to reweight the artifact's meaning, though the cost could be more viscerally rendered in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's understanding of death transforms from erasure to "phase transition," with the luminescent sprout providing concrete proof and emotional cost rendered through "anticipation" replacing "agonizing torment." The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the symbolic weight of the Knowledge Fruit seed. Who/where/when anchored early ("magnetic arbor," "three cycles since Kael's spirit departed").

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the cycle completes with the memory-fish restored to peace, showing clear before/after transformation. The accumulative lens holds consistently through tidal rhythms and moon phases. Cost is visible in Kaelan's acceptance of "searing pain" during transformation. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "tomorrow disappeared" which remains unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully - the pearl's placement transforms the bunker from isolation chamber to beacon of connection, with clear cost ("the fear that built this place screamed at him to stop"). The accumulative structure builds through inspection→discovery→understanding→action. Minor orientation lag (inspector role clarified late) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—protagonist reframes his relationship to guilt through the graffiti's conceptual repricing. Cost is visible in leaving the father's accordion behind. Deduction for the graffiti appearing as deus ex machina wisdom without sufficient setup, though the closure lands effectively with "leaving the weight of his father's music behind."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "Stay" reweights the entire manuscript of silence with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres well as each decoded phrase builds toward this revelation. Minor deduction for the slightly vague "second fateful letter" stakes that never fully crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Decisive Change lands with visible cost - Elias abandons his career for truth, leaving his report exposing the violin's true provenance. The causal chain from plant memory to coffee prophecy to final action is tight. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early and the "wounded soil" image charges the closure with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara completes her ritual and adds the captured memory to her collection, with visible cost in the soul's dissolution ("The shimmering outline on the obsidian slab was gone, its last echo spent"). The accumulative structure coheres as density increases through the infusion sequence, teaching its pattern early and paying off with the lotus locket's closing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes contentment through decisive action. The closure lands with conceptual cost - shifting from seeking to embodying. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final realization that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from Kaelen's moral crisis through the wind chime reading to his decisive act of removing the cloak, with visible cost in his shivering vulnerability. The hollow mirror shard moment effectively crystallizes the choice between certainty and doubt. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost when he walks away "lighter, less certain, and perhaps more human."

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ripples serving as the central metaphor that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The reversal of the ripples creates the decisive turn, and Kael's understanding that "to appear elsewhere, you first had to cease insisting you were *here*" lands with conceptual cost—the release of his desperate anchor to finding his sister.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from listening to understanding to resolution, with the arrowhead discovery creating meaningful pressure. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelan's harmonic thought releases the trapped pulse, opening the path to consciousness-navigation. Cost is legible in the hunter's eternal regret being resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—Kael renouncing automated creativity for purposeless beauty, with visible cost in his abandoned tools. The accumulative lens holds as diagnostic failures build pressure toward the decisive unstrapping. "The sacred was not a thing to be found, but a way of seeing" reweights his underachievement as misalignment rather than failure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through lanterns→descent→darkness→synesthetic revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Silas experiences the indigo of remembered music, fulfilling his vow with the cost of ten years' grief acknowledged. The piece teaches its pattern early (light/dark, sound/color) and pays it off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost: Kael discovers his purpose inverted—not charting the future but preserving the past. The "uncoin the void" prophecy pays off perfectly, reweighting all prior distillation work. Who/where/when anchored early ("observatory deck," "ambered field"). Accumulative lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Kael creating the crystal shard—a physical manifestation of grief that allows him to "hold her absence without being consumed." The cost is legible in "I am still a heartbroken reaper." The accumulative structure coheres through sound/light imagery, though the mechanism of crystallization feels slightly underexplained for full clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the 97-day pattern breaks into successful resonance, creating moisture in the dust—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (exhaustion, time spent).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from silence to understanding, with each photograph discovery tightening the stakes. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms "a haunting into a history" with visible communal cost. The corrective action in the ledger and the community hall display create legitimate before/after change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal chain from frustration through starling observation to crystal discovery and transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt internal cost ("quiet alchemy of his own soul"). However, the transformation's mechanism remains somewhat abstract - the vapor's effect could be more concretely dramatized rather than summarized as "profound internal shift."

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal drive with the radio static clearing → pattern recognition → threat detection → calibration crisis → muscle memory solution → successful warning. Closure lands with Earned Stasis—Kael preserves trust through successful action, with the cost visible in "hollow ache" and the weight of "consequences just beginning." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change lands with visible cost - Kael transforms the duplicate brain into conscious life while experiencing his first crack in emotional numbness. The causal chain from numbness to curiosity to action to responsibility holds perfectly. The creation succeeds but brings "terrifying sense of responsibility" as immediate on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward Elias's commitment to nurture the seed—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (years of dedication). The deductive process through physical evidence, botanical research, and symbolic reasoning creates satisfying linkage. Deduction for the cost being more declared than felt in the final moments; we understand but don't viscerally experience the weight of this decade-long commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the leaf blower symphony building to the wife's recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis through Lyel's refusal to use the portal, foreclosing his path home with clear emotional cost ("The ache in his chest remained"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered imagery of frost/mist/waiting toward the crystallizing choice. The pendant serves as effective causal pressure, though the cultists' motivations remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure: 72 failures building density until the method shift (command→surrender) enables transformation. The dissolving crozier becoming light/flower lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—the relic's complete destruction birthing "impossible" magic. Causality holds through successive approximation leading to final insight, though the penny-drop realization could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain drives the plot: failed standard protocols → mentor's lesson recalled → three assumptions systematically discarded → discovery achieved. The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara learns "to listen with a new kind of soul," with the cost being the risk of system overload during perigee. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain from ferry slipping reality → Finn's pattern recognition → radio manipulation → timeline merger. The closure (Decisive Change with merger of timelines) lands with clear cost - Finn now permanently aware of "fragile seams." The orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias achieves his goal but becomes trapped in his creation, a "perfectly rational, beautifully enchanted cage." The cost is unmistakable: connection discovered but at the price of isolation. Memory alteration as causality mechanism works well within the established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear because/therefore linkage: aliens arrive → Kaelen obsesses → develops edge geometry method → discovers patterns → presents findings. The closure lands with Decisive Change as humanity gains "a new ocean to cross" with visible cost (abandoning their anchored existence). The anchor metaphor's transformation from "grounding tool" to "first link in a new chain" provides resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Leo's frantic state transforms to calm through Elias's intervention, with emotional cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong causal chain from tidal window through obstacle to phase-transition solution to completion, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("He was alone, but he was no longer haunted"). The POV slip "my grandmother included" breaks focalization briefly. Cost is present but somewhat abstract - the ghosts' release lacks the visceral weight that would elevate to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The CR closure lands cleanly: "not a nervous count of borrowed time, but the quiet, constant hum of a life that had finally learned to find meaning in the spaces between." The accumulative structure builds through the ink ritual to Aris's revelation about voids, with clear cost in Elara's years of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the diamond's alignment with the starlings' pattern creates silence and reveals the first true word. The accumulative structure builds coherently through texture, sound, and pattern toward this crystallized moment. Cost is legible in "the entire history of my people's speech" being at stake. Slight deduction for the relatively smooth path to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks that reweight meaning—from investigation to witness, from bitterness to "frostbitten hope."

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's song transforms the silence from absence into "a listening, a space made sacred by sound." The accumulative texture coheres beautifully through the fragment's discovery, its placement, and the wind bells creating the conditions for transformation. Cost is visible in the "rusty" voice that "hadn't been used in a decade." Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "channel for the sudden, overwhelming grace" which approaches emotional ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias touches but doesn't capture his goal, proving the path exists. The cost is present (the vision dissolves, leaving him with only confirmation) and the accumulative lens holds throughout, building texture toward this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through repeated sunrise captures toward the resonant reconfiguration when light coalesces into "a warm, shimmering presence."

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the symphony's release transforms grief into peaceful awe with visible cost (the son's physical remnant dissolving). The piece teaches its magical system early and pays it off through starlight-as-key methodology. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph. The cost is legible in "dissolving into motes of light" and the mother's transformation, though could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through layers of observation, distortion patterns, and finally tactile contact to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration where one recovered memory becomes "a key" to begin his real work.

    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias achieves "silent, profound communion with the cosmos" through pattern recognition. The hopscotch-to-starlings-to-luminance causality holds beautifully under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his "sociable isolation transformed"—he gains cosmic connection but remains alone. The piece teaches its pattern early (wear patterns as messages) and pays it off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the eclipse-shadow reveals the keyhole and transforms the frozen Orrery into "warm and golden" light with "the sound of healing."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: Kael's understanding that "Elara hadn't vanished; she had simply stepped fully into the myth" reweights the entire journey with visible cost—his former self as "jittery courier" is explicitly gone. The accumulative texture builds from aurora to pendant vibration to crystalline garden, each element tightening toward the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Decisive Change closure lands powerfully - Elias's theory is proven correct but in a brutally literal way that destroys his emotional framework. The cost is visceral: "the earth beneath him was now made of broken steel and indifferent physics, not love." The causal chain from setup through experiment to revelation is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong accumulative/textural closure with Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara completes her task but loses all context, creating profound irony with clear cost. The piece teaches its magical realism rules early and follows them consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Kaelen's act of preservation transforms loss into legacy with visible cost (the vow's death, the city's dissolution). The causal chain from slide retrieval through resonator capture to philosophical acceptance is tight. The closure lands with conceptual weight—"Another vow was logged; another piece of their soul was saved"—though the cost could be slightly more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with three clear failed attempts building to the successful lie about the fob's flaw.

Cost is visible and conceptual—beauty vanishes to renew wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Decisive Change with the android escaping its programmed existence, achieved through a causal chain: magnetic shift enables power diversion → chaos miniaturization → dome breach → freedom.

    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's acceptance of randomness (rolling dice) combined with her own coded vulnerability liberates both herself and her mother's consciousness, with palpable cost in surrendering control. The accumulative pattern of code-breaking through dance pays off when she realizes the final key requires surrendering to chance. Orientation anchors (sunken lab, Elara as codebreaker, mother's journal) land early and cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the whale's gravitational distortion, the salt chamber's resonance, and the coffee ground divination toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas touches a fragment of stolen memory. The cost is visible—he retrieves only a fragment, not the whole—and the closure transforms despair into hope through earned proof. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the gravitational pocket mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - the prophecy is muted rather than destroyed, with clear cost implied in the "fragile blanket" metaphor.

    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelen's whistle briefly harmonizes with the fireflies, then accepts his separation—a Charged Poise moment with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres through moon paths, tea ritual, and firefly patterns, though the philosophical reflection slightly dilutes dramatic immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage from superstition to investigation to discovery, with the stillpoint revelation reframing the orchard's survival as physics rather than folklore. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where "one more lie had been carefully excavated and replaced with a fact" carries intellectual cost—the loss of comforting mythology—though emotional weight remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal chain culminates in decisive change: Elian rejects both shadow-paths and creates a third way, with immediate world transformation (storm dies, sun breaks through). The map discovery enables this resolution through clear because/therefore logic. Cost is visible in rejecting supernatural power for uncertain human agency. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the chest opening.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the music box receives "not restored, but transfigured" purpose through accumulated shore sounds replacing its lost song. The cost is legible in "the dense, weighted silence of a child's silenced joy" transformed into "fleeting, beautiful resonance," and the poet's "small existence justified" shows earned stasis with visible forfeiture of the original melody.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands with Decisive Change - the hostile frequency is neutralized and integrated into the Heart's field. The causal chain from detection through resolution is clean, with visible physical cost ("sweat-soaked and trembling"). The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the viaduct's lights dying represents freedom's arrival. Cost is legible in "the oppressive hum that had been the soundtrack to her entire life vanished." The moon-tracking method creates causal linkage to the moment of network vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Decisive Change through Elias's choice to document the full truth despite Fletcher's directive, with visible professional cost implied. The causal chain is clean: discovery → sensation → investigation → understanding → defiance. The closure lands with "more his own than it had been that morning," showing earned autonomy. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of finding the journal exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Arthur's understanding reweights from fixing broken men to showing them "where the light can get in." The light-through-clouds metaphor pays off the accumulative pattern with visible cost (Marcus Thorne's death, Arthur's guilt) and earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when the glider "grips" reality itself, creating a Decisive Change with felt cost (risking death over acid). The yearning algorithm concept builds through kaleidoscope observations to the "Grip" revelation, causally driving the modification and test flight. Orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, Kaelen) establish early. The closure lands with undeniable transformation—from falling to holding—though cost could be slightly more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive: numbers discovery → coordinate recognition → server breach → truth revelation → whistleblowing action, with each beat tightening options. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Elara forwards the data, transforming her from searcher to whistleblower with implied professional/legal cost. The "inconvenient truths" line crystallizes the conceptual reweight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as community fracture transforms to "first step toward mending." Cost is visible in Mara's revealed trauma and Jorn's isolation. Causal chain from accusation through vision to revelation is clean. The "weighted breath" motif creates effective structural bookending.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when the ice's "deep, resonant sigh of release" provides Elara the exact texture of ending she came to learn. The accumulative structure builds through debris cataloging to ice-calving epiphany with clear cost: she's using others' catastrophe as her classroom. The parasol tip's juxtaposition against endings creates the necessary fold in patience.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Conceptual Repricing closure—the burned letter transforms from "trophy of pain" to "intricate, dark lace" marking necessary boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the completed spiral mosaic that transforms "disparate moments of pain" into "a single, coherent image." The accumulative structure coheres as each return adds photographs until the final piece—the girl releasing the paper boat—completes the arc from industrial loss to renewal. The cost is legible in the years of patient work and the community's documented suffering, though the closure could be strengthened with more immediate felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes "an oracle for a history that had never been written," with clear cost of forsaking publication. The accumulative structure builds through acoustic layers to this earned stasis. Minor deduction for slight ambiguity in how the crystal's properties work mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Silas draws the circle and becomes the sound rather than capturing it—a clear before/after with felt cost in the "heartbreaking moment" and dissolving chalk. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this crystallized acceptance, though the "precognitively forgetful" mechanism slightly strains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the station achieves stability but loses time itself—"a beautiful, silent prison outside of time's grasp." The cost is unmistakable: they're saved but frozen. Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from vibrations to spinning clock to lens solution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details (tea steam, record crackle, hand-holding) build toward the resonant reconfiguration of reunion. Closure lands with visible cost in the tear and the death before sunrise. The piece teaches its pattern of sensory accumulation early and pays it off. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Lena's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing when shadows are revealed to fold "inside out" at noon—a discovery that reweights reality's post-spoon-bending grammar with clear conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Elara methodically builds toward this revelation through rune study, key deciphering, and automaton activation. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias charts "his own beautiful, terrifying mistake" with the tooth as its center, crystallizing his acceptance of a larger reality with clear emotional cost. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the discovery serving as pattern break that reweights his entire worldview. The cost—a lifetime of dismissing his wife's beliefs—is palpable in "Forgiving himself for dismissing the woman he loved would be the work of a lifetime."

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the polished glass transforms into self-sustaining light, fundamentally changing Elara's relationship to her purpose. The accumulative lens holds consistently through rhythmic polishing, memory layering, and sensory buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the dripping water pattern serving as the decisive turning point that enables Elara's gesture. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelen's understanding shifts from "acceptance of its grim prison" to "understanding of the choice," with emotional cost visible in his "first [breath] that didn't sound like a prelude to shattering." Orientation anchors (server farm, Elara, Kaelen) established early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Elias's act of burying the seashell transforms his relationship to his abandoned stories from guilt to guardianship, with visible emotional cost.

Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Kaelen's return to stillness after completing the map crystallizes his endless vigil with clear cost (physical suffering, isolation). The pattern of stillness→action→stillness creates meaningful cadence shift, and the child receiving the map demonstrates on-page consequence, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through reflection observations until the resonant reconfiguration when echoes bloom again. The closure lands with felt cost—a generation's lost wedding memory returning to push back against grey stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the hybrid creature's birth—not the resurrection Kaelen sought but "a new, strange, and perhaps more resilient kind" of beauty. The cost is legible in the creature's impossible contradictions and the machines' pause below. The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through assembly, incubation, and emergence toward this reweighting moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from carrying symbols of fire's end to understanding healing as active bridging. The cost is legible when she sacrifices the coin—"a small, silver weight of a past she no longer needed to carry"—and the final image of black sand reweighted as promise rather than prayer satisfies the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from breadcrumbs of light and architecture to the precise celestial alignment. The closure—fountains whispering restored memory—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: years of patient work against skepticism. The geese's departure mirrors Elara's completed pause, reinforcing the temporal constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong conceptual repricing closure where Xylar's realization that "the search was the light" transforms the entire premise with clear cost - releasing the gear represents abandoning calculation for emission. The accumulative structure coheres well through the sonar pinging motif's evolution. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's understanding transforms how he approaches his craft, with visible cost in the abandoned personal memorial. The accumulative structure coheres through returning nightly sessions. Who/where/when anchored early. Lens holds throughout.

Cost is visible in his torn hands from the rescue and the ongoing burden he shoulders. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with pattern breaks in the tapestry's frayed edges leading to revelation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias places the sovereign case beneath the decoded map, reuniting intention with path—the cost is the acceptance that the reunion will never occur. The "gardener of memory" insight reweights his entire practice.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure—Kaelen poised with quill above vellum, options crystallized, cost acknowledged but not yet paid on page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered details toward this crystallized moment. Cost is clearly signaled ("condemn old ways," "force hardship") though the actual mark isn't made, which is acceptable for Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Elias's nightly ritual crystallizes as an act of eternal preservation, with cost visible in "the clenching fear that was his constant companion." The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increase. Deduction for the conceptual leap to "teaching dust" which, while resonant, slightly strains the established causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual stages (portrait viewing, mask observation, burning, scattering) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael achieves "transcendent peace" through Elara's constructed illusion. The cost is legible in "The grief would find its way back in, as it always did" and Elara's "heavy, knowing stone" heart, showing the price of this temporary shelter. Orientation anchors (gallery, curator, grieving client) establish clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis - Silas's decision to continue as "memory, not teacher" carries visible cost through his isolation and the futility he acknowledges. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the post-plague world context emerges gradually) and the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the rosette metaphor that pays off in the breathing exercise and final harmonic moment. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the choir achieves unity through subtraction rather than addition, with visible cost in the "fragile music" born from "ashes of vanishing hatred." The transformation from discord to harmony is earned through Elias's tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Decisive Change—the plant transforms from "thorny, bitter tangle" to "beautifully structured organism" bearing hope-flavored fruit. The pruning sequence builds density through specific taste-memory pairings that reweight the plant's growth, and the cost is visible in what Elias removes (anger, fear) to enable new connections. Minor orientation wobble with "knowledge fruit" concept introduced late.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Conceptual Repricing—the revelation that routine killed bio-mechanical life reweights the entire premise with clear conceptual cost. The riddle mechanism forces discovery rather than receipt, creating earned revelation. Slight weakness in the speed of Lena's understanding, but the final image of "planted like a seed" resonates with proper weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the flamingo contemplation and flower planting—visible changes with implied cost to conformity. The accumulative structure holds as small disruptions cascade into awakening. Deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally felt on-page; the "hushed blaze passing from one awakened soul to the next" gestures toward change without showing price.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Decisive Change through Mara's choice to bury the poison, with clear cost in abandoning her mission and identity. Causal lens holds: each revelation (they weren't conquerors → the membrane is a lung → she's the disease) drives the next beat toward her final action. The closure lands with felt cost as she "buried the certainty she once carried," though the immediate stakes could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mathematical proofs accumulate toward the rupture at "seven," delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms prison into canvas with visible emotional cost ("fresh wound in his soul"). The closure lands with earned transformation, though the precise nature of the original "missed opportunity" remains slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where isolated city dwellers respond to Elias's symbols, proving his thesis that kindness language is "dormant, not dead." The accumulative structure builds through six nights of painting to the seventh night's broadcast. The cost is visible in his vulnerability and the risk of being "just a fool." Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves clear Decisive Change through the waterfall's restoration, with visible cost in the community's desperate gamble on Alistair's theory.

Closure lands with both physical transformation (ice to water) and cultural renewal (lost anthems saving lives).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the lever pull, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias experiences "the shimmering, terrifying potential of an unwritten past." The cost is legible in "the lines of his life fading" and "the immense weight of every choice he had ever made was being lifted." The yoyo's temporal loop mechanism provides causal linkage to the final unspooling. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the transformation, though the physical details ground it sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through luminance imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's void becomes "a weapon." The cost is legible in "leaving the empty shell behind" and the transformation from wound to weapon. The dream dictionary annotations create coherent pressure that pays off when "unbosom the break" enables the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Kai transforms destructive force into harmony, with visible cost in his physical exhaustion and the orchard's survival hanging in balance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where pattern recognition builds to devastating revelation. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands powerfully when the map reveals their ordained extinction—the watchers weren't gods but warnings, completely reweighting the premise. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "city of Atollon," though the cost could be more viscerally felt beyond "crystallizing dread."

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Elara surrenders the document after being convinced by historical parallels, a Decisive Change with visible cost ("millstone" shift). The Ashworth Collapse parallel drives the turning point effectively. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical progression and the convenience of having exactly the right historical example.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Elias accepts his role as "silent archivist" with visible cost (scraped knuckles, risk taken).

Deduction for modest cost visibility - the emotional/opportunity cost could be more sharply defined beyond physical scrapes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - Elias's final commitment to "re-indexing" crystallizes options with clear cost (solitary work against institutional lies). The accumulative revelation (mark→stamp→theft→correction) builds effectively under the textural lens. Slight dock for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Kaelen transforms grief from "drowning sea" to "current" he can move with, earned through the gem-polishing journey and dream revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias commits to restoring Anya's memory, with clear cost (his life's work pivots from profit to penance). The causal chain holds throughout. The revelation about memory erasure effectively reweights all prior silence. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the watch hand's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the exchange completes but forgiveness remains withheld, with the drawer pull's "dividend of life" marking visible cost. The moon-phase protocol creates persistent constraint throughout. Minor deduction: the "tragedy" backstory could be more specific to strengthen causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through utility poles → compass → facing the sea, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elias turns toward water for "the first time in a year."

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elian transforms into a permanent part of the orchard's "eternal, steady glow," with visible cost (loss of human form) clearly dramatized. The accumulative lens holds as sensory ritual builds to transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara abandons her search and commits to presence, visible in the steady hand tracing. The accumulative structure coheres through moss/stars/saucer/tablecloth motifs building to the closure vow, though the revelation paragraph ("Lost time didn't pool...") tells rather than dramatizes the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through repeated photograph rituals toward opening the dimension. The closure—Elara drifting toward the threshold having healed humanity's soul—lands with clear cost (her solitary vigil transformed into passage). The pattern of sink/float/stitch creates coherent escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's accidental prophecy fulfillment, with visible cost in the volcano's transformation and the fireflies' dispersal.

The "cradle of sparks" secondary network activation provides concrete mechanism for the revolution's success.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal lens: vision of destruction → decision to use star dust → channeling aurora through rock patterns → diverting the tide. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (exhaustion, spent resource) and conceptual shift (from observer to active participant). Minor orientation friction with "silver-skinned eels" and their purpose slightly dulls early clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: timer expires → envelope opened → key and negative revealed → decision to leave. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elias shifts from passive vigil to active journey, with cost visible in "terrifying journey." Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "scars" and their consequences, which could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure—the needle card's angles decode the sundial's philosophy through fencing movements, culminating in a Decisive Change when the scroll reveals a physical journey. The cost is intellectual submission to Elara's gambit, legible in "Her challenge was both an insult and an invitation."

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where four people sorting books crystallizes community formation with visible cost (the risk of trusting strangers in a destroyed world). The accumulative lens holds throughout, with each beat adding texture toward the final image of collective rebuilding. Orientation anchors establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure—Elian steps through the portal, leaving his station behind (Decisive Change with cost). The film-as-map revelation reweights all prior viewing ("watched it a thousand times, not for memories but for flaws"). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. The causality of translating visual code to sonic key to create the portal holds under the accumulative lens.

The orientation is anchored early and the pattern of light and transformation is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive lens holds strongly. The closure is a decisive change (silent takeover) with clear on-page cost (the winking lights as a "silent promise"). Orientation is immediate; the "because/therefore" linkage from blackout to opportunity to successful activation is flawless and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a decisive change (harnessing the tide) with a resonant reconfiguration (his new understanding of the dawn). The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: his actions cause the wave to split, and the accumulated pattern of stones enables it. The cost is legible in his slumped posture and the groaning strain of his boots. The orientation is immediate and the premise's rules are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pressure builds through sensory density (storm, timer) toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The final image of the city light reconfigures the vigil from passive endurance to active development, with cost felt in the "terrifying journey." Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the taught pattern of symbolic objects (dome, timer, envelope) pays off decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Strong causal drive lens holds: each action (observing sundial, using needle reflections, executing fencing moves) links because/therefore to the closure. Orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (retrieving the map) with a clear, felt cost in the precision and effort required. The mechanism's click provides a satisfying, on-page cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arrival of the drifters reconfigures the solitary work into a nascent community, charged with potential and cost (the risk of this new vulnerability). The accumulative lens holds, building texture through the shared ritual with Elara before the new pattern of community is introduced. The cost is legible in the vast, echoing space and the "haunted eyes" of the newcomers.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Hybrid drive lens (causal pressure from compass failure + accumulative pattern of film flaws) holds. Closure is a decisive change (stepping through the doorway) with cost (leaving piano and arbor behind) legible on-page. The final image reconfigures options with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly: pressure builds through sensory and symbolic density until a cadence shift (the song) reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—the monsoon's arrival and the memory's renewal. The final image of rain as "promise of renewal" lands with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost on the page ("the regret had transmuted into simple, quiet contemplation"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with a cadence shift reweighting the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length. The climax is slightly summarized versus fully dramatized, a minor flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated observation through the dust filters reweights the central stake until the orchid→weed insight triggers a Conceptual Repricing and a Decisive Change. Cost is on the page—“unfiltered reality was jarring, chaotic, and full of pain”—and the final act (seeking the shovel) forecloses the prior remove. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: image-density builds toward a reconfiguration, while a causal spine (ledger → frost cipher → cave → kiln) holds. Closure lands on-page with cost in the final firing and glass-encased ledger, foreclosing avoidance. Orientation is clean from the outset. A slight plausibility stretch in decoding smugglers via frost doesn’t break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density of image and pattern builds to a clear reconfiguration: trauma is woven into the visual symphony rather than erased. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and closure lands on the page with cost (the pearlescent fade, her fatigue, the bloom). Each beat follows a purposeful pressure curve: focus on the flower → trauma intrusion → integration → release. The final act (closing the tuning fork case) seals the before/after with conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: package → certainty → impossible‑space transit → missing heart → lens insertion → resolution of signals. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with an RR hue: the noise is transformed into tranquil inscription. Cost is present (immense pressure; ability’s toll) though not lingeringly priced after the act. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the chosen lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: donations → bell as personal message → Elara’s public declaration → communal action and donor’s seed/tools reply. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration toward self-sufficiency, with a felt cost of risk and labor implied in the garden commitment. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is strong. The price is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres via the breath cycles and optical ritual to a Conceptual Repricing: love is not stored; it’s rewoven into the world. Causality is clean—method → deepening focus → humming tear → pattern revelation—and the final cost is the relinquishment of a chest-bound answer in favor of dispersed presence. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page with the “motes” image. The price is felt in the eased-but-not-vanished ache and the tears that close the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under a Causal lens, the beats link cleanly: shard found → memories consumed → use maze geometry to sever → total erasure. Closure lands decisively on the page with a steep, undeniable cost: “He felt no memories, no past, no name.” Orientation is early and stable; single scene coherence holds. No teleports or soft resets; the artifact’s rule is kept and concluded.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal spine under a Causal lens: arrow arrives → cipher unlocks sequence → machines become obstacles → enforcers delayed → allies can reach the vault. Orientation is immediate and legible; props and rules are paid off in the defense sequence. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she remains bound yet secures the purpose, with the cost visible in the final image. The timed pressure from the collapsing wall coheres the beat progression without convenience contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the causal ritual (collect absences → feed forge → imprint) proceeds with clear stakes and a ticking constraint. Drive lens reads Hybrid with accumulative pressure and a causal ritual spine; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where he gains the silence-shaped boundary instead of the break itself. Cost is on the page in the agonizing sound and years of preparatory deprivation embodied in the jars. The final image reweights prior material without loose ends.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: flower-code deviation → pilgrimage-like approach → tactile contact → conceptual repricing. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost (“portraits… seemed flat”), reweighting the premise. Orientation is clear; single POV, two shards with one transition, and the dominant stake coheres. The because/therefore links are modest but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (situational pressure with causal turns) holds cleanly: thaw → structural failure warning → intensified collapse → forced choice. Orientation is immediate and stable; the furnace, warning light, and tilt escalate in coherent steps. Closure lands on the page with cost (she lays the blowpipe down; the sphere collapses). The outside shard reweights stakes without soft reset, carrying the price forward via the kept bookmark.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: shell → hidden panel → cast cipher → code → containment, culminating in sirens and Julian’s panic. Closure is decisive (containment triggered) with a conceptual/emotional cost (renunciation of “broken puppet” role). Orientation is clean early; the single-scene pressure is coherent. Slight plausibility stretch on the failsafe access doesn’t undercut the on‑page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the hush thickens, the star pulses and dies, and his method culminates in a completed glyph as night becomes absolute. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the single scene is coherent. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend: he finishes the map at the only viable moment and forecloses further action, with the wind’s softened rage signaling a reweighted world. The cost is largely conceptual and solitary, which keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: prior loops accumulate, therefore the violin is reinterpreted, therefore the interface choice breaks the loop. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the origin of thought reframes the prison and self. Cost is legible in the risk of “imminent system failure” and the loneliness of the post‑loop stillness. Orientation and causal links are clean and sustained within one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive holds: a causal turn (he eavesdrops) nested in an accumulative pattern of tickets/lens pays off in a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single transition to the park is motivated by the new doodle. Closure lands with cost (leaving the desk for the first time in a decade; admitting to spying) and reconfigures the silence from mistrust to shared grief. No loose set‑ups; the box and lens reprise decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: Elias’s cultivation produces a living richness that draws bees, then the decisive arrival of rare butterflies, which reweights the judging outcome. Closure lands via a resonant final act (cracking the clear marble) that marks cost and proof. Stakes are clean from the outset and paid off on the page; only slight softness is the managerial verdict remaining implied rather than spoken. Orientation is crisp and the solstice frame tightens time effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece tightens toward a single action and a conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp early; the machine, window, and lever cohere. Closure lands via the lateral echo and Elias’s reweighted worldview; cost is felt but primarily conceptual. The causal chain is simple (set up → pull → echo) with minimal complication, keeping the arc elegant but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal closure: weeks of failed attempts set up the decisive choice to disturb the water, producing the melody and resolving the central stake on the page. Orientation is immediate (flooded opera house, orchestra pit, single night), and the act carries cost and consequence (artifact damaged, obsession released, ghost at peace). The final cadence (“snuffing out the lanterns”) cleanly seals the before/after state without over-explaining. Slightly quiet middle pressure keeps it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres from fever‑break dawn to the charged placement of the illustration in light. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she renounces knowing, with explicit cost (“collapse the waveform… and she could not bear it”). Who/where/when are anchored immediately; causal throughline is clean (fever → note → smudge → decision). The final image reweights the opening constants without explaining them away.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is clean early (abandoned tunnel, radio psychic, confession), and the causal chain is tight: sound → approach → interpret pressure → identify the valve → act. Closure lands on the page with cost: turning the wheel alters the environment and reconfigures his internal stance. The causal lens holds throughout, with the radio calls functioning as a motivated interpretive device rather than a convenience. No unkept setups or teleports; the payoff is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly from oppressive density to a cadence shift of silence via a single decisive transition. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a temporary renunciation with explicit cost (“I knew I would eventually have to trace its folds again”). Orientation is firm early, and the pattern is taught then paid off. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the eclipse’s approach, the opening of the box, and the “linking” culminate in a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (tears, tremor, relinquishment of desperate grip). Orientation is clean from the outset (Sage Ridge, eclipse timing, roles). The closure happens on the page with a legible before/after. Minor authorial explanation (“He had not healed her…”) trims some organic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries in the diaries progressively reweight the central stake from curiosity to elegy. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—“not a savior… only a historian”—with the sorrow as the cost. The causal thread (find diaries → read revelations → reconfigure meaning) is coherent and sufficient for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: bell → disk/specs → coded fortunes → rendezvous observed → personal pivot to depart. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost (abandoning his role/identity). Escalation is relatively smooth and low-resistance; the operation proceeds without on-page complication, which softens pressure. Still, the because/therefore logic holds and the ending is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sonic layering → glitch → master switch progression coheres and culminates in a conceptual repricing: the entity cannot withstand plural perspective. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/what). The closure cost registers in Elara’s ragged breath and the tiredness of Alistair, with the palette’s reweighted final image. Slightly light on overt price beyond conceptual defeat prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres around the alignment window and the unfinished map; the lavender dawn and mirrored horizon mark the decisive intensification. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “click” and the repriced homesickness with a felt cost (spent energy, acceptance over conquest). Orientation is clean early (who, where, when) and the pattern taught by the prose holds. No causality breaks; the turns are motivated by time pressure and focused craft.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative dominance: descriptive density and pattern-shift culminate in a decisive change as he accepts the seed memory and stabilizes the world. Causality tracks: the codex → seed memory → acceptance → stabilized geometry → regained gravity/self. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when on the viaduct). The on-page cost is legible in the loss of his defiance and the dissolution of echoes into him.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens from setup to the inverted performance to the charged stillness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—silence becomes presence—and the cost is the embraced constraint of deafness and renunciation of conventional sound (“not…defeated by a loud noise, but by a deeper…silence”). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Persistent constraints (loss of hearing, broken needle’s bass bias, stone conduction) shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear orientation and a clean single-scene arc culminate in a Charged Poise closure: he rejects direct confrontation/authority and commits to a lateral mission. The causal chain (surveillance unease → pigeon → tube → phantom data → underground mapping insight) holds without gaps. Cost is gestured to—risk to safety/solitude—though not sharply dramatized on the page. The hybrid causal/situational drive remains consistent through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres as the UV reveal (“Somniflora”) and the bloom’s scent force a stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he finally breathes and grieves, paying an emotional price on the page. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causality gaps undermine the turn. The vial’s message and the flower’s bloom form clear because/therefore linkages within the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from observation to a conceptual repricing: the offered binary is revealed as description, not choice. Orientation is crisp early (grotto, rope, Lumin), and the arrival of the being tightens pressure. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend with conceptual cost (forgoing transcendence, accepting solitude and species twilight). The cost is present but more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: ritual, offering note, environmental response, intensification, and the drop as closure. The final image delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush is voiced without being broken, with cost in endurance and restraint. Orientation is clean from the outset. Setups (bowl, shipwrecks as body) pay off precisely at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a coherent Hybrid drive (procedural causal steps within an accumulative lyric pressure) culminate in a closure with cost: he extracts joy and accepts sorrow as residue. The sequence—sense, subsume, separate—builds to a decisive act that reconfigures stakes and future options. The cost is explicit on the page (“leaving the sorrow behind as a residue in his own soul”). The ending’s Charged Poise/Earned Stasis lands without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean Causal lens: mistaken-letter friendship → deepened rapport → locket reveal → grant reveal → reweighted bond. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands on-page with the envelope and the named fund; cost is implied (financial/social risk, emotional exposure) but soft. The decisive change is credible, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: rumor of Echo → communal search → fissure discovery → reframed meaning of Echo → night labor → public acceptance. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: he accepts stewardship of the arbor with a visible, chosen cost and altered identity. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the lens stays causal to the end. The polishing cloth as on‑page seal of change is elegant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: cadence breaks → Chronovore manipulates time → crystalline nest → pendant resonance → targeted “borrowed beat” → restored rhythm. The drive lens reads Causal and holds through closure; the decisive act is on the page with a clear before/after. Cost is the lightest element—risk is implied (waking the giant) but not felt as a loss or wound, tempering the impact. Orientation is strong from the outset; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: setup of goal and tools → quiet invitation → hum → lattice → fade → reweighted stance. Orientation is strong from the opening; causality is persuasive within the taught magic logic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (“the loss was not gone”), and the final action (picking up the eyes, continuing) seals it. A touch more friction prior to ignition could have deepened cost, but the on‑page turn is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with causal beats (find → decide → place → watch) resolving in a resonant final image works cleanly in a single scene. Orientation is crisp from line one; the outage and dawn window contain the action. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he is “found” without being seen, reconfiguring the premise. The cost is mostly conceptual (ongoing anonymity, risk), not overtly dramatized in the final beat, keeping it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-POV, clear anchors, and a situational lens cohere: storm damage → failed repair → observation → choice to clear the wreckage. Closure lands with a decisive change (saw and pry bar) and an implied cost (foreclosing exact restoration/identity). Because/therefore logic is strong even within a reflective mode. The retirement offer is present as pressure, not resolved, which keeps the focus clean.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: storm → rain trails → discovery → claimant → exchange → artistic redirection. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: he surrenders a rare artifact and reorients his art toward the story/person. Coincidence (her arrival) is plausible given the storm exposure and parallel trails. The final image (eyes reflecting amber) makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative ending: pressure mounts via pattern breaks (stuttering music, murky futures) to a decisive threshold where overlapping shadows trigger the reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with visible cost—the surrender of the Heartstone and Lyra’s clairvoyance—reweighting the premise. Orientation is crisp early and the single throughline (guard vs. share) holds. The because/therefore chain is lean but coherent within the cave’s taught rules.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece accrues meaning through found objects until the woman’s recognition reweights the archive. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—her posture and resolve shift—anchored by the object’s charged reprise. Orientation is clean from the outset and the time jump (“Later that month”) is controlled. Cost is felt through loss surfacing in the woman’s account and Kaelen’s ongoing endurance, though the pressure remains quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain: crack‑reading leads to the wall, which demands use of the punch, which opens the vault, which reframes the dare and tool. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with a Decisive Change—Elias becomes the next keeper and reinterprets the ticket punch as responsibility. Cost is implied (a life foreclosed) rather than dramatized, softening impact. Orientation is strong from the opening and the single transition is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: storm intensifies sound → recurrence in whale tones triggers recall of “forgotten method” → transcription on the tile → visions → reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the opening lines. Cost is legible in his renunciation of skepticism as identity anchor and the grief it unlocks. No major teleports or convenience solves beyond the established notes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, clean causal chain: storm → field manipulation → amulet’s resistance → rift → crossing. Closure lands with a Decisive Change; the cost is legible as he abandons sanctuary and risks true ending. Orientation and rules are taught through action (space “refusing,” 90‑degree light) and paid off at the rift. A slightly smooth path (few setbacks) keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: the repatriation channel enables the scheme, “The Ghost” buys a 72-hour window, and the diagram confirms success. Orientation is solid early, and the single time jump to a week later pays off as closure rather than evasion. Closure is a conceptual repricing in the cycloid image that reweights her moral calculus with felt cost (heavier silence, the gamble’s math). Slightly low friction in the middle—no on-page complication tests the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual builds toward dawn’s pitch shift and a charged capture, then resolves to a calm, earned stasis. Orientation is swift and clean; single POV, one scene with a brief forward glance to the workshop. Closure lands via a cadence shift when the lamp’s hum “wavered,” yielding a new signature and reweighted stakes. Cost is conceptual (endurance against the void) rather than dramatized loss, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: the tide’s rise intensifies the layering until the horn fractures it, yielding a charged poise/earned stasis. The closure lands on the page with cost: the composite memory dissolves, foreclosing relief, and the narrator recommits to waiting. Orientation is crisp from the outset (port, containers, death certificate). The persistent constraint (tide rhythm and erasure) shapes both tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a clean causal spine: bowing leads to resonance, to the needle of dust, to conceptual realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing under a Hybrid (accumulative-dominant) lens, with the cost of a private, non-spectacular win and a lifelong task. The cost is felt but modest; still, the on-page image reweights stakes. No orientation debt or lens wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Plan → implementation via graffiti → inspector’s reconnaissance → charged poise ending is coherent, with the early arrival serving as the tightening beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the city’s chaos now encodes order, reweighting the Consortium’s narrative. The cost is conceptual (risk persists) rather than materially paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean single‑scene arc under an accumulative/textural lens: lure → bloom → blade of sunrise → sublimation → quiet aftermath. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with cost—he endures, captures, and loses the subject instantly. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and causal links hold. A precise clock (pre‑sunrise) binds the beats without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a Causal lens, each step flows: broken hum reveals disorder → diagnostic via basins reveals hidden fracture → targeted repair → clean hum and concentric ripples → ship departs. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a charged final image (still water, ship’s beginning) that reweights the opening noise. Cost is primarily temporal and attentional, but it is legible through the horn‑driven countdown and her unbroken concentration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when) with no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and an accumulative build to a Conceptual Repricing: the convergence is a phenomenon, not a place. The condensation-map herald tightens the frame and the closing image crystallizes a before/after with cost (“his life’s work…a joke”). Causality is coherent under the chosen lens; beats escalate logically (falcon return → temperature drop → frost map → hum → stance shift). The closure lands decisively on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the final tuning fork strike “settles into the ground,” reweighting the silence with a cost of ongoing return. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; causality is steady (footsteps layer → echoes arise → anchored hum). The cost is conceptual and temporal rather than acute, which slightly mutes the ending’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene structure under a situational lens coheres: oxygen clock + psychic storm force stance crystallization. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he secures the hush and accepts the cost of likely death. Because/therefore links are clean (open vial → storm → isolate thread → seal → power flatlines) and the cost is on the page. Orientation is immediate and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from atmosphere to the charged revelation and then to the act of breaking the seal. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: he frees the hush and accepts the social cost (“They will hear only the echoes of my father’s fictions”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/why). The cost is legible in the last paragraph and ties to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the bead → apparitions → budding orchid → transference coherently escalate toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the ending offers on‑page cost: Lyra’s dissolution and the charged silence after. Setups (bead as key, toxic nurture, once‑century bloom) pay off at closure without mechanical overexplanation. The causal chain is understated but intact and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative tapestry that culminates in a causal, decisive act during the storm; the closure lands with cost (bleeding hands, risk, endurance). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and setups (plate, sleep-sewn threads) pay off in the final reconfiguration. The storm functions as the tightening pressure that forces a stance shift from unconscious to conscious making. The final image reframes the labyrinth as a living map, achieving on-page transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of wandering → discovery → excavation → placement culminates in a conceptual repricing via the hidden ship carving. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and beats link coherently. The cost is modest but legible—patient labor, acceptance over answers—charging the final image. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration that marks a before/after in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one continuous window culminating in a Charged Poise: sealing and committing to surface mail, with a conceptual cost (slowness/uncertainty vs surveillance) stated on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when clear), and the end image reweights prior material. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this mode; the cost is implied and felt rather than dramatized by consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: observed anomalies → encoded map → timed burst during calibration → confirmation → charged waiting. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when clear within the opening), and the gyroscopic window provides a crisp structural spine. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the act is done, options reweighted, and the cost is the risk and waiting under threat of a coup. Minor limitation: much of the conspiracy is summarized rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the swell from murmuring spirits to condensation words to the dissolving “sorry” delivers a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clean early; causality (evocation leads to vision) holds. Closure is on‑page: Kael gains painful clarity, Elara is spent and must await moonlight. The constraint of her energy frames tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: decoding the cast steadily reweights the central stake until the final charged poise. Orientation is clean from the outset (atrium, field clinic, truce). The closure lands on page as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias offers the thunder line, and the General’s guarded facade shifts at felt cost. Because/therefore linkage is tidy (see → decode → frame to father → softening).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: connect to the network → attempt with light → near‑washout/fragility → shard‑anchor → display → dissolution → repriced acceptance. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on the page with a felt cost as the image dissolves. The causal hinge (using the fragment) pays off cleanly. Quiet but decisive reconfiguration anchors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned experiments with reflected sound build toward a cadence shift where the echoes converge on him and the rule‑set reprices reality. Orientation is clean from the opening scaffold to the garden and back, and the nested awakenings follow a coherent internal logic. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: he returns altered, with a charged object and a reweighted choice. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but legible in his renunciation of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive holds: garden omen → greenhouse urgency → rising threat (“active probes”) → decisive act (seed in orchid) → citywide static. Closure lands on the page with a charged cost-frame (risk of wiping consciousness) and a tangible outcome (silence, sirens stutter), though the cost remains mostly implied rather than paid. Orientation is crisp and consistent; one scene with a clean tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from ache to a cadence shift at the twin‑moons beat and the “blossom armistice.” Closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts pain, alters practice, and enshrines the postcard, with the new wind‑song as on‑page proof. The cost (continuing insomnia; surrendering prior tactic of hiding poems) is legible. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and feeds the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens from quiet preparation to the charged act of lighting and the brief chorus of names, then returns to silence. Closure lands on the page with cost: the orchid lights, but the world below is “lost forever,” reweighting the act as archival elegy rather than rescue. Orientation is clean from the opening; the stakes are coherent and persist through the final image. The persistent constraint (only a cracked chime remains) shapes tactics and the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative dominance: the ritual builds texturally to a luminous construct that reweights the stake, then resolves in a Charged Poise closure (fragile hope replacing silence). Causality is tight—he completes the loop, the symphony manifests, Elara arrives drawn by resonance. Cost is legible as risk and sacrifice (blood, shattering clause, emptied vial), though not paid on-page. Single-scene focus and one dominant stake are cleanly maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: envelope → adhesive analysis → chain cipher → hidden cavity → letters → repricing of father’s silence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt emotional cost, framed by the volcano’s “morning breath.” Orientation is crisp early, and the single‑scene focus holds. The puzzle’s neatness skirts convenience but remains justified by the established skills and objects.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (attic, skylight, pigeons), and the causal chain is clean: storm → scramble to save pages → Anna’s anchoring hand → confession → next‑morning sharing. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost in relinquishing the defensive mythmaking. The two‑shard structure (storm day/next morning) is tight and purposeful. No unkept setups or teleports; the meteorite’s reprise is functional to the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean because/therefore chain: grain symbol → logbook decoding → forecast of threshold → decision to cross. Closure lands as a decisive crossing with an explicit cost (“make it permanent and absolute”), reweighted by the final image of chosen separation. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric texture, held consistently. No orientation debt; the terrace’s “north” constrains tactics and anchors the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from blackness to bioluminescent “meadow of stars” tightens pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration of belonging. Orientation is clean; the stakes (before sunrise, prove the theory or leave unchanged) are coherent. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the relinquishing of grief’s sharpness and the acceptance of this place as “home.” The cost is soft but legible and integrated with the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is crisp, and the causal chain is clean: seeds map → route halts → conjecture → decisive placement of the glass → revelation. The piece reads Hybrid with a causal spine culminating in a conceptual repricing (the “end” as arrival), and the closure lands on the page. Cost is present as time pressure and the receding vines but remains moderate. The decisive act is earned and resolves the core question without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: channel → water → vibration → coin cascade → projector → bishop reflection → mural. Closure lands as a charged poise/resonant image that reweights the scene with conceptual cost (art that “seemed to happen,” then vanishes). Orientation is clean; the only softness is the low felt cost and near‑certainty of success. Still, the on‑page chain is tight and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → failed conduit → inward refocus on “gaps” → anchoring → inscription → fledge. Closure is on‑page (Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing) as his identity and relation to exile reconfigure. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent and earned by prior patterning. The on‑page cost is implied (defiance under a ban, indelible mark) rather than concretely exacted, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure tightens from bay → pond ritual → prism finale, each beat reweighting the stake. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he chooses not to save the atrium after a pattern‑reading that reframes value. Orientation is clear by the first lines, and the final image concretizes cost. No causality breaks; the ritual yields knowledge that changes his options’ meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a consistent accumulative/textural drive culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image reweights scars as testament rather than failure. The porcelain box and the Perseids pattern the cadence toward closure with a legible cost (the scar and relinquished “naive perfection”). Reflection is well‑framed by present action and advances the present stakes. Quiet but satisfying cadence shift at Kaelen’s touch and Elias closing his hands on the box.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (grotto, device, goal), and the scene proceeds through a clean causal chain: design → tide catalyst → light/hum → gauge dip and rise → stable reading. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (needle stabilizes higher) and a conceptual price (experiment spent, risk weathered). The drive lens reads primarily Causal with lyric texture; the cost is present but subtle. Scope discipline holds to a single scene and stake.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, discoveries progress cleanly—hum → diaries → Prometheus → choice—and closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The cost is conceptual but legible: she refuses to carry or expose the legacy, returning the evidence to the hearth. Orientation is strong from the outset; no causal seams show. The because/therefore chain is implicit yet coherent across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds from terrace setup to lullaby→light→city reflections→bells breaking the spell. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—spell ends at the bell; “borrowed heartbeat” recedes; the city retains a charged residue. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the scene is contained. Cost is subtle but legible in the ephemeral limit and self‑erasure, not jaw‑dropping.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clear orientation, and a coherent Situational drive: the celestial window, the ritual tactic, the first signature, then the second. Closure lands on‑page with cost—identity and power relinquished in a charged, time‑bound act. The because/therefore chain (ritualization → Kaelen moves → Vorlag follows) holds without coincidence. Stakes are tested at the brink when “the moment was fraying,” providing a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene, clean orientation, and a held accumulative/textural lens culminating in an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure. The cost lands on the page as the egg dissolves—an irreversible forfeiture that reweights the world’s “bloodstream.” Setups (drought, map, vent) pay off without contrivance. The final turn—doing the act and leaving into rising thunder—feels inevitable and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the knots to the judge’s keystone and releases in a wave. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—hidden truths returned—though the cost is more conceptual than personal or tactical. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The causal scaffold (each echo → final keystone → release) is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Causal. The argument → doubt → ethical recalibration → decision to stage a response show forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (accepting responsibility without betraying method). Quiet but legible pressure; the cost is relational and artistic rather than externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the patterned building, the thin trickle of monarchs, and the culminating last pass create a resonant cadence shift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the last butterfly vanishes, the structures stand, and he accepts the cost. Orientation is immediate and stable; the single scene tightens coherently. No causal breaks; the cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through density—set-up of aim, meticulous weaving, activation, projection—and resolves in a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when he accepts light over sound and chooses to preserve via imprint (sketching to cast in silver). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph and causality tracks. The cost—accepting limits—registers in the final turn without hand-waving.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV, one scene with a dream shard, tight storm clock, and a clean because/therefore chain culminating in the wafer’s ingestion. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the directive reframed as chrysalis and the present ignites; cost is legible in water rising and structural collapse. Orientation is swift and functional; no teleporting props. The ending’s price is on the page even without explicit death.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single‑scene build holds under a Hybrid lens with accumulative dominance; the ritual intensifies to a visible reconfiguration (the nebula’s reveal) and an Earned Stasis coda (dismantling the altar). Orientation is crisp from the outset and the set‑ups (tile, schematic, alignment) pay off cleanly. The cost—keeping the secret, choosing inward treasure over power—lands, if quietly. The because/therefore chain is intact, though the pressure is more tonal than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal spine is clean: Elara initiates cellular persuasion → Vale recoils → reality convulses → sanctuary tears → catalyst appears → Elara reweights the “broken pin” → Vale chooses release. Closure lands on the page with cost (the sanctuary ripping; Elara dissolving) and a decisive change in the world’s state. Orientation is swift and stable, and the drive lens holds. The convenient “tool that reappears when needed” skirts deus ex, but it had been pattern‑seeded and is used through Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: breath-pattern → frost-pattern → ephemeral capture → collapse. Closure lands on the page with cost: the mountains shatter and she chooses acceptance/repricing (“a boundary…could be erased”). The sextant’s reprise in her hand seals the before/after. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: termination → secret return → tools fail → rummage → ribbon/seed → reconceived tactic → softened hum. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing with cost, reconfiguring “mending” into “supporting change.” Orientation is crisp early, and the single-scene scope holds. Slight convenience in the found object’s timing keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues from paradox and disquiet to a conceptual repricing where the cameo’s blankness is redefined and Kaelen’s role reweighted. Orientation is clean early (curator, orchard, rule), and the two‑shard bathroom turn tightens focus. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: he returns to the orchard with “terrible clarity,” foreclosing earlier misbeliefs; the cost is conceptual but palpable. Causality holds internally, with no teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: Kael’s warning → research of gaps → silent wall impasse → renegotiation → access granted. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the staircase appears and she steps down). The cost is largely conceptual (risking denial/retaliation, burden of futures) rather than concretely priced, but the charged poise of the final image reads. Orientation is clear early; scope control is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each swatch intensifies the pattern until the climactic “Ocean’s Heart” reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the quest flips from finding a place to building a memorial, with a clear cost (loss of the “blissful aberration,” cold loneliness). Orientation is clean in the first paragraph (who/where/why), and the pressure coherently tightens toward the bridge. No causality breaks or unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear causal chain: thirteenth chime → seal match → retrieve rope → reconfigure → door stabilizes → reading room. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the anomaly becomes a catalogable space). Cost is mostly conceptual—no felt sacrifice—so the final beat lacks sting. Orientation and lens (Causal with light textural layering) are clean and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: noise pressure → seek frost chamber → read ice map → imprint pattern into stone → hush. Orientation is swift and stable, and the climax occurs on-page with the stone’s violent flare and cave shudder. Closure is a Decisive Change with an Earned Stasis flavor (“found its eye”), and the price—risk, strain, and the temporary scope—is legible. The structure honors a single scene with a crisp escalation and release.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is immediate (custodian, Spire, pavilion, broken prism) and the causal chain is clean: alignment night → assembly → keystone choice → beacon rekindles. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and conceptual cost: risking the belief that meaning can return against the suffocating silence. The once‑per‑century alignment provides a functional clock. The lens reads chiefly causal with a lyric overlay and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Strong causal chain: storm → crystal discordance → lightning‑dependent measurement → glyph → console → revelation → stance. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis with cost (he will not pierce the fog despite now knowing how). Orientation is clean and the single scene window is tight. The decisive three‑second bolt functions as a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory listening → false plateau of silence → object‑driven insight → pattern recognition → conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the first lines; cause/effect is coherent within the lyric mode. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: he redefines the hush as canvas and abandons the search for a singular cure. The cost is subtle (letting go of a magical fix) but on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence → sensory patterning → conceptual turn → charged spoken line. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. The “minute‑long pause” creates a contained window that justifies the inward travel and the final stance. No causality breaks or unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is linear and legible: the inversion clock opens a window, ascent to trellis, charged pause, re‑entry with a reweighted interior. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the room remains small but he breathes fully; cost is felt in the “sudden burden” of gravity and the persistent walls. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the silence motif reweighted at the end. A hair shy of 9+ because the explicit price is emotional rather than decisively foreclosing a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean; the scene holds a single throughline from embarkation to delivery. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the teaching sequence builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration as the woman’s stance toward silence reverses. The cost is modest but legible—she surrenders her defensive noise-habit. No causal missteps or broken setups.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: hum opens veil → orchard/monolith → peeling reveals map → shard completes circuit → signal fills throne and cancels purge. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a conceptual repricing (the throne needed a heart, not a body). Orientation is clean and the single‑scene structure holds under a causal lens. The cost is present but modest, mostly time pressure and forfeiture of rule rather than a punishing loss.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the scene builds from ruins to ritual to felt transmission, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (a conduit replaces a fading threshold). Orientation is clean; the POV shift to Liam is legible and motivated. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (fragile path across a void she created), though the price is more implied than dramatized. Strong coherence without mechanical plotty turns.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal throughline is clear: Promise manifests → she volunteers → guided by glitch texts → locates the flaw → channels pressure via the bolt → diamonds fall. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a reweighted world image. The cost is mostly internal endurance rather than a visible loss, slightly softening impact. Single-scene focus and anchors are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single scene with crisp anchors and a clean accumulative/textural drive culminating in a Conceptual Repricing. Because/therefore linkages are soft but coherent: crank → hum → pressure → understanding → release. Closure lands with a felt conceptual cost (a line’s self-dismantling reframed as love and chosen peace). No orientation debt; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive reads clean: dissolution → consult program → execute patterns → sever tether at the precise beat → reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the final act is an on‑page Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of tether, the program’s disintegration). The clasp’s function is set up and paid off; no unkept setups or convenience turns. Cost could be shaded slightly deeper, but closure is firm and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each discovery tightens meaning toward a clear closure unit: the hidden note reconfigures the stakes from procedure to witness. Orientation is clean early; causality is plausible (dust pattern → unfurl → button → indentation message). The ending lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: sorrow persists but is reweighted into service and ceremony. No beat contradicts the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive: causal journey to the booth, then accumulative/textural reweighting at closure via the citywide flicker of truth. Orientation is swift (18:43, Directorate broadcast, Elara in her apartment), and the puddle-map to lagoon to activation is cleanly motivated. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: a “crack in the mirror” reconfigures stakes without over-explaining. The cost is implied (exposure, abandonment of safe anonymity) more than concretely priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene, early orientation, and a clean accumulative/textural drive: pattern threatens to cohere; Elias counter‑patterns to dissolve it. Closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—the coded cadence is erased, hush restored—with a felt cost of vigilance and sorrow. Causality is coherent (drips → code → counter‑melody → sympathetic vibration → falter). The cost is primarily emotional but legible in the final vigil image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative texture → causal trigger) holds: patterned labor accrues until a single prod causes the awakening (Decisive Change). Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (folklore, Arbor‑Heart) pay off. The cost is mostly conceptual (relinquishing his purely quiet role), which trims peak impact. Still, the because/therefore chain is firm and closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: breadcrumbs → greenhouse mechanism → improvised pivot → passage → cavern; the closure is a conceptual repricing where he embraces uncertainty. Orientation is strong and the single transition is motivated. The cost is subtle—foregoing the drive to fix—but legible in the final lines (“become part of the question”). A minor convenience (instant recognition of the mechanism) keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from furnace stoking to the coin’s fracture and luminous repair, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with clear price. Orientation is crisp early; causality tracks through “immutable laws” and conservation stretched to the edge. Closure lands on the page: he cannot reverse death but transforms the memory and himself at visible cost. No stray set‑ups or unkept promises undermine the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal line: descend → locate via misaligned harp → engage and redirect confession to joy → melody re-aligns → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration on the page, with the harp righting and the spirit dissolving into sunrise. Cost is present as moral and emotional labor rather than a sharp sacrifice, but the throughline holds. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph with no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Situational/Accumulative lens, pressure coheres from waking to clearing to the charged realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes the experiment and repurposes the strap, foreclosing the escape path. Causality is clean with present cues gating memory, though the price at closure is more conceptual than visceral. A slightly clearer on‑page consequence would lift the cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: the lens draws her to the tent → deliberate errors signal the keyhole → intention‑bending lens reveals the buried truth → she unfastens the lie → the canvas corrects. Orientation is crisp early and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the painting transformed; history acknowledged) and a felt exertion cost. The cost is not large, but it’s legible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: power dies → ghost appears → Leo reads the ceiling → retrieves the barrel → ghost resolves. Closure is on the page via the ghost’s release and Leo’s “repair” of the veil, landing as an earned stasis/decisive change hybrid for this scale. Orientation is anchored early and never slips. The cost is subtle (risk, exposure, time), but the engage/leave hinge puts a real before/after into focus.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterning of frost, hum, and light densifies into rupture and aftermath. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing with a visible cost: the perfect system dissolves and is replaced by charged potential. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what), and beats link coherently toward the single culmination. The aftermath image (open archway, milky trees) confirms a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the temporal squall intensifies pattern and yields a CR closure as the shard reframes meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early; rules (mirrors, squall) are taught via action and paid off when the shard absorbs time. The final stance—choosing a story‑driven revolution—lands as a realized after image rather than a pure promise. Cost is more inferred than dramatized, but it’s legible (risk of madness/derision, renunciation of old tactics).

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive holds: he installs the chip, the rust attacks, doubt dims the chip, he recalibrates his stance, completes the tether, and the chord radiates outward. Orientation is immediate (workshop → resonance chamber) and the single-scene structure is tight. Closure is a decisive change with on-page cost (near-failure, regained conviction). The only slight softness is the largely internal price, but it reads earned at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative finish: causal beats (factory shuts → compass frees → fissure → maze → psychometry → hinge → lagoon) gather into a resonant renunciation. Closure lands on the page with cost as she leaves the compass and refuses to bottle the scent. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The psychometry turn is earned by the compass’s history and doesn’t read as a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal links are strong: discovery → projection → deciphered covenant → actionable diagram → defensive build → wave mitigated → repriced understanding. Orientation is swift and clean, and the single-scene window sustains pressure to a concrete outcome with cost (soaked, exertion, risk). Closure lands as Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing without breaking rules. The lantern’s timely instruction skirts convenience but is foreshadowed and integrated enough to avoid a deus ex feel.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the layered window reveal builds coherently to a Conceptual Repricing: nourishment from starlight and the inherited thesis. Orientation is clean from the opening and the cathedral sequence tightens around the method. The closure lands on page with a reweighted premise and a family link, though the cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt. The ending’s cadence shift to “dawning hush” as a carried state seals the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: change in tactic → phantom’s first response → deciphered coordinate. Closure lands with cost (weeks trapped, psychic burn) and a concrete before/after (from stalemate to key). Single POV, two shards, one transition—clean structure. Stakes stay narrow but coherent, avoiding convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean: memory fragments → lantern ignitions → deepened commitment. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with a clear price—life‑long, draining work undertaken. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the bottle acts as an anchoring constraint that coheres the rule‑set. No causality breaks; the accumulative lens holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clear CR/Charged Poise: foghorn silence → test shaving → dead‑tongue message → reweighting of the horn as ward → oath reinterpreted with cost. Orientation is clean early, and the because/therefore chain is tight. Closure lands with conceptual price (betrayal of vocation, threat to civic memory). Only minor: the plan’s feasibility is deferred, but that suits the form.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres from dissolution toward quieting order; the method repeats and intensifies to a clean on‑page closure (the core reopens). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the object/action chain is coherent. The cost is light—success comes without a visible sacrifice beyond effort—so the ending’s RR lands more as serene resolution than hard‑won change. Still, the before/after is legible and decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: the countdown anchors pressure, and “because/therefore” links carry to a reconfiguration at zero hour. The closure lands on-page (rerouting power; hum replacing shriek; clouds part), with coherent setup (alignment, siren protocol) and payoffs (rope, breaker). The cost is more conceptual/implied than explicit, slightly softening the impact. Structure is tight, single-scene, with clear orientation and a decisive culminating act.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual pattern deepens into a felt empathy that reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page with cost via Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he redefines dust as “memory of light,” foreclosing a protectionist stance. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and all set‑ups (glass, arms, stillness) pay off. The because/therefore chain is quiet but coherent and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with clean causal beats (Lyra points → he opens → release/repricing). Orientation is crisp early (wasteland, apiaries, sundial), and the stained glass box threads the scene coherently. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: a shared anchor is unlocked, ghosts dissolve, and he ends in an earned stasis with felt cost. No teleports or unkept setups; the honeycomb reveal retrofits prior stakes elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: poetic bait → returned message (“willow”) → pressing shard to panel → resonance and reconfiguration. Single POV, tight scope, and one major turn are all appropriate for length. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing; the “key” feels slightly convenient but seeded by the willow motif and the subtly “different” panel. Cost is present conceptually (the end of frantic seeking), though it’s gently framed.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story coheres: kite snap → search → feather → weave → final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: accepting loss by transmuting it into a “woven dawn,” with the cost felt in the decision not to intervene and the ache that remains. Orientation is clean early; no lens ambiguity at the end. The ending’s charged poise (feather pocketed; child receding) makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the slow ritual of wiring accrues into a charged final connection. Closure lands on-page via the hum, shared “heartbeat,” and the circle drawing—an RR with a felt cost in his spent body and implied death. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the diary’s fissure secret pays off causally. The because/therefore chain holds without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens steadily from trail to tower to center, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when he reframes “artificial” and leaves the amber. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the closure lands on the page with cost (the relinquished object and stance). Each beat coheres toward convergence; nothing resolves offstage or by coincidence. The final image reweights the premise without over‑explaining the mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: listening, selection, planting, then the charged poise of the final image. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the beats connect coherently via the birds’ guidance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—a garden on a gravestone—with a felt, if modest, cost. The structure is strong but the decisive change is gentle, not pressure‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: static → Barrow’s scent cue → groove‑writing hypothesis → painstaking reading → journey → hinged fissure → geothermal garden → repriced goal. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: not a person found but a promise to nurture, with the cost of leaving safety and days of strain paying for it. Orientation is clean and the Hybrid lens trends Causal-dominant by the end without contradiction. Slight convenience in the final discovery is offset by the taught pattern of clue → scent → place.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure intensifies from ritual to perception spike to the glimpse, then resolves in a conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes “true north” as a choice, with the cost being the relinquishment of an inherited certainty and continued pariah status. The shutdown reinterpreted as “key turning” pays off earlier setup without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with clean causal spine. The plan is taught and paid off: climb → light spectacle → swap → Sylas opens the piece; closure lands as a conceptual repricing from control to growth, with the seed reweighting the room’s sterility. Orientation is crisp; the single scene coheres. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, trimming the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is clean: sensing the prisoner → coded pacing → intensifying tapping → grief performance → U-N-B-I-N-D → key turns, door opens. Closure is decisive and on-page with cost (Elara’s risk, Regent’s cracked composure). Orientation is swift and stable; single scene tightens without detours. The whispering gallery’s acoustics and the barred window function as persistent constraints shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: accidental vision → search → inert find → feather method → anchoring. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her dream pattern shifts and she chooses to seed a new reality, foreclosing nightly escape. Cost is present in the weeks of pressure, fear, and the risk of failing herself; the stone reweights the premise toward present‑tense belonging. Orientation is clear early (bookstore in a mountain; single POV) and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: months of study → decoding the border → internal acceptance → labyrinth’s click → hush unravels. The closure is a decisive change with on‑page cost (the renunciation of glory) and a concrete world effect (time resumes). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure holds. The puzzle’s solution and the spell’s release feel earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern is taught (whispers refracting) and culminates in an on‑page cadence shift (echoes shatter) with cost (Wardens’ arrival). Orientation is clean early, and pressure tightens with the horn’s moan and her final “aimed” poem. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis: the single truth is broken into many and Elara pays the price. The causal line between method and outcome is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene structure with a clean situational lens: one breath, one statue, one goal. Because/therefore causality holds: matching pockmarks and narrating threads build to the heart crater decision, resulting in the statue’s transformation. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (“bathysphere,” “acid sea,” “Observer”).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the wrong turn to the skylit cavern intensifies the pattern and charges the final act. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—dropping the shell—and the cost is legible on the page. Orientation is clean from the outset, and causality holds without convenience resolving the stake. A single, elegant cadence shift at the oasis delivers a satisfying before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate (lantern room, predawn, fog) and the accumulative/textural drive coheres: intent concentrates until the ship manifests. The lens’s rule-set is seeded before use, avoiding a late deus ex machina, and the payoff is dramatized by the captain’s corroboration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a tangible effect (ship found); the on-page cost is subtle rather than sharply priced. The causal chain is believable within the story’s magical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: the midnight call cues a precise act, the placement triggers the signal, and the ending lands as Earned Stasis with cost (accepting permanent loss while building a road for others). Orientation is clean, the phone calls scaffold the build, and the final thrum reweights the frame. The causal chain is simple but tight; one decisive tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds cleanly: affliction → research → relic → storm attunement → post‑storm test. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the ability to speak a partial truth—with cost signaled by the traded season and the mental “click”/severance. Orientation is immediate and stable; two‑shard structure (night storm, dawn neighbor) is legible. The neighbor’s question is a touch convenient but functions as a credible on‑page test.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated nightly engagements with the boutonnière build to a cadence shift and conceptual reweighting. Closure lands in the final act of placement and the realization of surrender (“He had brought his mountain to the sea to let it drown”), with felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening and time progression is legible. Quiet, but structurally tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Causal lens: ants → fissure → cavern → chip activation → doorway → renunciation. Orientation is strong early and the closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with cost (choosing understanding over entry). Setups (chip, timing window, promise) pay off cleanly. The chip’s interface is a touch convenient but pre‑seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear Causal/Situational spine: dream compulsion → climb → grotto’s lure → near‑contact → refusal. Orientation is established swiftly (queen, mountain, warning), and the closure is an on‑page Earned Stasis with cost (“We are going down,” and guarding others). The astrologer’s warning pays off as the rule that defines the peril and the cost of refusal. The before/after is legible and consequential without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative build lands in a clear reconfiguration: she abandons sterile math for lived feeling and forges a new sun, then gifts it at cost (accepting his departure). Orientation is clean from the outset and the causal beat—Kael’s secret—tightens options. Closure is on-page and paid for emotionally in the final exchange. No dangling setups or deus ex solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: frustration → trance/flight → reconfiguration → steady writing forms a coherent arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: chaos becomes a chartable landscape, with a visible behavioral change (he writes). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Cost is subtle (relinquishing the jealous posture) but legible in the foreclosed self‑loathing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors and an accumulative/textural drive that coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Elara reframes loss into “the extraordinary weight of what remained,” with the bell’s brighter chime and sun piercing fog as cost‑charged images. Causality flows naturally from the request to the act to the mutual release. The price—the persistence of anosmia and the acceptance of a new vocation—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the accumulative lens holds: density builds from scholarly attempts to a hush‑ritual that reweights meaning. Closure lands on the page with the shedding and the released breath—both a decisive change and a conceptual repricing of “runes.” Cost is legibly paid in renouncing his trained method and confronting named wounds. The throughline is clean, with no causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: Vex’s device activates → sensory deluge → apology → reconfiguration into acceptance as dawn and demolition loom. Orientation is immediate, single scene, live clock, and the closure carries cost on the page. The Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration lands via “phantom limb” and the diesel engine cue. No dropped setups; stakes and outcome are proportionate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern density intensifies toward the center, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page through the silent drop and cessation of witnessing, with clear cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the ritual spiral provides structural cohesion. No causality breaks; the tightening is purposeful and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single‑scene, accumulative structure is clean: whistle → discrepancy → focused inspection → shard → reframe → renunciation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a touch of Earned Stasis. Orientation is crisp and causality intact; each step naturally follows. The cost is subtle but legible in his decision not to intervene, though it could tighten with a clearer operational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because he detects pressure and built a resonator, he creates a permeable door; therefore she passes; therefore he releases and accepts loss. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the single scene tightens to one decisive act. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost on the page. The “door not wall” concept pays off as action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: the graffiti quest accrues pattern until the balcony inscription reweights meaning. Orientation is clean; two shards (library → city traverse) resolve into a clear closure image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: accepting “beautiful risk” and lighting the lantern. The on‑page cost is conceptual, not logistical; still credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: patterned repetition and the glass note steadily reweight the call from “goodbye” to “hello.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the final click reads as a pause with conceptual cost, while Silas accepts continued isolation. Orientation is clean early and the scene holds a single, coherent arc. The causality is soft but intentional, with no breaches.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: restoration work accretes meaning that reweights the jetty scene; closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (“haunted by the ghosts of generations”). Orientation is clean, the two-shard structure is coherent, and the locket → recognition → meeting is legible. Coincidence (Tomas’s arrival, blooming flowers) pushes toward the mythic but doesn’t undercut the earned repricing. The cost is felt rather than merely asserted in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure coheres under a situational/accumulative lens: rumor → arrivals → “critical moment” → Silas’s nudge instead of reveal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he chooses process over myth, with the final tableau of shared work and music. Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (moon rock, clock, reciprocity networks) are paid off. The cost is modest but legible in the renunciation and vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the melody accrues note by note toward a reweighting at the Stillpoint. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—his grief remains but settles into harmony. Orientation is clean and the rules stay consistent. The final step through moss transforms the premise on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single POV, tight scene, and clear anchors establish who/where/when early. Under a situational lens, the new signal applies coherent pressure; attempts to edit trigger cascading consequences that force stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he refuses to alter the past and instead appends a “footnote,” paying the price of relinquishing salvation. Causality is intact and the final image is charged by the persistent constraint (the anomaly).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned mapping deepens to the ferry‑landing nexus, where the cadence breaks and reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s silence becomes song, and Lyra’s voice dissolves—an emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when anchored). The causal thread within the pattern (mapping → “Deeper” → “Now” → disruption) is coherent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: clue trail → sealed chamber → tapestry lens → projected constellation → hidden text → reconfigured aim. Closure lands on the page as a stance shift (from arsonist to curator) with felt cost (foregoing vengeance for long, careful work). Orientation is early and stable; single scene coherence holds. Pressure plate, light fissure, and lens use keep turns motivated rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the beat intensifies, the world answers with light, and the final image reweights the premise with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and each move stems from the prior (silence → lab → slab → drumming → lagoon). Closure is a charged poise: she achieves the dream inside the prison but with an aching absence that forecloses the fantasy of wholeness. The cost is on the page in the empty space beside her and the “duet for one.”

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: storm blinds tech → Kaelen’s challenge → Silas navigates via celestial map and coin → ciphered key release → manifest retrieved. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of status and ethos (“The walls listen”), though the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Single-scene coherence and anchors are strong. The resolution is smooth and perhaps too frictionless to crest higher.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light is patterned and focused until a small, on‑page reconfiguration—darkness answers and eases—lands. Closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: a permanent sliver of light with the ongoing duty of watch. Causality is clean (shutters → beam → response), and the cost is conceptual—permanent vigilance and a partial concession to the dark. Orientation is clear early and never wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural drive: the plan culminates at the ninth bell, shifting the town’s “chord” from resignation to curiosity—a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is strong; the two‑shard structure (library → grotto → library) coheres. The cost is implied (defiance under an oppressive Authority) rather than dramatized, slightly softening the closure’s edge. The final reprice—Maya’s “I can draw that”—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Causal lens: desire → show the scrimshaw → night approach → listening/call → anchors tear free → departure. Orientation is clean, single transition to the cove, and every beat tightens toward the final act. Closure lands with visible cost (leaving home/sister) and a decisive change (island rises; he departs). The scrimshaw’s rule-set is taught through action, not exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from playful narration to a charged silence, culminating in a reweighted final tableau. Orientation is clean from the opening; cause flows via ritual acts, not twists. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he claims a private hush at personal risk and moral cost. The happiness mandate and turbines persist as constraints shaping the end image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density builds toward a Conceptual Repricing—the colonnade revalued from chaos to blueprint—with a quiet, earned cadence shift. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene; single stake. Cost is subtle (self‑dissolution, shivering aftermath, implied defiance of edicts) yet present. A slightly firmer on‑page pressure point would have strengthened the closing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Causal lens, the chain is clean: unreadable malady → rumor of barter → plant grammar reveals the price → build resonator → perfect note → acceptance and awakening. Orientation is crisp and the closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with the moonflower unfurling and Lyra’s voice. The cost is modest (craft, patience, precision) but legible enough for this scale. No dropped setups or late rule changes undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene tightens from failed attempts to a reweighted tactic—“see the echo”—culminating in a closure beat where the carillon completes as light, not sound (a conceptual repricing). Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent (note → apparatus → emitter → hologram → retuning → glow). Cost is present but understated: he abandons his founding assumption; if a concrete loss had been dramatized, the closure would land even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: a sequence of origami-guided viewings accrues meaning to a culminating reconfiguration on the dais. Orientation is clear early (observatory, Elias, his loss), and setups (stencil, curtains of intention) pay off at closure. Closure feels on‑page and costly: he uses the stencil of his dead partner to illuminate a shared dome, reweighing his past. A hair shy of 9+ because the cost, while legible, is more lyrical than pressured and the tightening is gentle rather than constricting.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the mapping ritual builds density toward a conceptual repricing where Julian reframes his loss as part of a recurring pattern and Elara accepts the burden. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherent. Closure lands via the charged final image of cards and tape with felt conceptual cost, though the turn is quiet rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single-scene accumulative design builds to a clean Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she obtains purified Aethel at the expense of identity. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what), and causality is coherent: key added rule (“purify” via pattern‑avoidance) drives the ritual. The An‑Korin revelation deepens stakes and reconfigures the ending image with cost. The final composite reflection locks the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: undetectable blight → comparative analysis → origin identified → choice to integrate → on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (keeping sorrow), crystallized in the final image. Anchors (who/where/when) are established early, and no causality gaps appear. The resolution is earned without resorting to a mechanical “fix.”

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative: the scene’s density builds through craft, culminating in the fitting and color shift that reweights stakes. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as he reconceives compassion as strength; the price is the relinquishing of anger/pride. Orientation is clean and the causal thread (build → fit → acceptance) holds. The cost is visible on the page during the final handling beat.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → tunneling → shared pain with the ivy → collapse → reframed stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: “not meant to close… but to carry,” with the hourglass and meteor hush charging the cost. Orientation is clear early (post-procedure, tower at dawn), and causation coheres through his chosen method. The cost is palpable on the page in the reopened wound and the severed plant communion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density builds to a conceptual repricing that reweights the theater as repository. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/what) and the psychometry deepening provides the single meaningful turn. Closure lands with cost as a solemn, final stance and the canister’s careful rewinding. The pressure is quiet but coherent—no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via recurring vigil until the “impossible” meteor triggers a Conceptual Repricing—noise becomes stardust lament—landing on the page. Closure is clear: she pushes the instrument aside and redirects her art toward people, foreclosing pure withdrawal. Cost is felt: she accepts enduring sorrow as part of harmony rather than eliminating it. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when), and the pattern holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, coherent scene with an accumulative/textural drive: disturbance → attunement → synthesis → reweighted final image. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and causality holds through the tactic of interference and resonance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (crystal‑pine + nascent dream) with an implied cost (maintaining balance, renunciation of pure restoration). The cost is subtle but legible enough for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the single scene coheres. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sound-density intensifies until a conceptual repricing lands at the quartz tree. Closure is a clean CR—he reinterprets his translocations as guided—though the on‑page cost is modest. The causal chain (hear chimes → seek nexus → insight) is tidy and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens from vigil to guided wayfinding to the charged promontory and the solo step. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: “This does not grant passage; it confirms readiness” reframes the journey, and she commits to walking alone. Cost is present (relinquishing the guides, facing the mist), and orientation is clean from the start. The structure is simple but coherent, with one meaningful cadence shift at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens holds: patterned images tighten into a charged final act. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he refuses escape, confronts the bond via the bolt offering—with legible cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why) and causality links stain → memory → decision → offering. The price of remaining under shared silence is palpable in the last corridor beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: the marginalia anchors → confluence → pellet → rune → star severed → world reweighted; the library’s power channels through Kael. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost (the lie is sundered; Kael and the Athenaeum vanish). Orientation is strong early, and the single‑scene structure holds. A slight abstraction in the external consequences keeps it just shy of the 9+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean from the outset, and the causal chain is tight: rare confluence → attempt → failure → overlooked symbol → corrected sequence → manifestation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost: the reef appears only briefly, recasting his quest as summoning rather than travel and leaving a felt price in ephemerality. The hybrid lens (causal with a CR finish) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: alignment → hum → stones respond → network awakens → satellite acknowledges, delivering an on‑page decisive change. Orientation and window control are excellent for a single-scene piece. Cost is implied (risk, endurance, secrecy) rather than dramatized, slightly dimming the closure’s weight. The lens reads Hybrid (accumulative build with causal closure) and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each beat links cleanly—kite script → plant‑mediated calibration → frequency → unsealing—with no teleports or soft resets, and orientation is firm from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the embryo activates, reweighting the world’s terms with conceptual cost to the Reconstruction’s plan. The on‑page cost is primarily conceptual/inferred; no immediate consequence tests the risk at the moment of success.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single, coherent scene with clear anchors and a tight arc from calm care → trigger → paralysis → grounding → deliberate resumption. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she acknowledges ongoing menace yet recommits to careful tending (“just enough”). The cost is on the page (somatic aftermath, ache, ongoing vigilance). Situational lens holds: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats stack cleanly from discovery to ritual making to reweighted identity, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (artist, lighthouse library, isolation), and props/actions pay off (threads, spiral, charcoal). Closure lands on-page with cost: he keeps the ache, forecloses repair, and reframes his practice as cartography. The linkage is consistent and legible without mechanical plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: eclipse → rockslide → drone as catalyst → ink ritual → disappearance following the drone’s quantum thread. Orientation is clean early and maintained. Closure lands as a decisive change with implied cost (abandoning kin, entering an unknown between). The cost could be made more concrete on the page, but the charged final image carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive is clean: discovery of the contraband letter leads to a tactic (old network) and a decisive act (release). Closure lands with a charged poise: the send key is pressed, and the final snow image makes the coming cost legible. Orientation is clear from the first lines and the single‑scene frame holds. The Council threat and personal betrayal provide on‑page stakes and price.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate and steady (dome, desert, father’s visit) and the scene holds one clean window. Under a Situational lens, pressure coheres around the off‑stage father’s legacy manifested by the knife. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the sheathing and boxing foreclose a path, with conceptual cost explicitly encoded. The because/therefore is quiet but intact: father’s presence → forgotten knife → tested stance → chosen containment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single scene, single POV, and an accumulative/textural drive that coheres through to a clear closure: the echo is caught, manifests, dissolves, and the world’s patterns settle. The cost is legible (he channels ancient grief and risks dissolution), and tactics flow from prior set‑ups (counter‑humming, spike as divining rod → voicing silence). Orientation is clean from the opening. Slight smoothness in the middle pressure prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: the inciting call → Celeste’s tactic (proof by contradiction) → Davies’s realization (“His brother…”) → reweighted ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing; the lie’s orbit breaks and the father’s story is reframed. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no lens ambiguity. The cost is present but more conceptual than dramatized, keeping this from the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: letters → lab → haunted firmware → constellation-etching → silence. Closure lands on the page with cost—the hum ceases and the lab’s “perfect stillness” is the felt before/after. The only slight strain is the mechanical plausibility of scratching circuits with amber, but within the story’s rules it functions as ritualized, earned intervention. Scene scope and single-POV coherence are tight with one controlled transition.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere thickens, the tile sparks resolve, the mandala accrues until a communal Charged Poise settles. Orientation is swift and clean, and the final image reconfigures options—shared attention replaces silence—without violating the setup. Cost is conceptual (renouncing speech, expending finite art in a transient medium) rather than dramatic, yet it lands. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but it reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation, lens (Causal), and stakes are established early and held: tessera → activation → renaming → identity reset. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and visible cost (loss of Joric; Kaelen’s “hollow ache”). Setups pay off cleanly; no causal gaps or late conveniences. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but still legible in the final exchange and aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: layered sensations escalate toward the applause-echo and a clear on‑page reconfiguration (Elara’s stance shifts and she forecloses the coin toss). Orientation is clean from the outset (maze, Chronos Tree, night), and the sequence tightens coherently. The felt cost at closure is modest—Elara’s renunciation of chance over choice is meaningful but low in visible consequence. Still, the cadence resolves with a charged final image (the blossom) that seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: setup (studio test), first result (grief image), then the decisive second test tied to the static shock, culminating in a reweighted relationship. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they establish a shared language at the cost of Elias’s certainty. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lens holds. The coincidence risk in the first image is wisely stress‑tested by the second beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset; the accumulative/textural lens is taught and held through the cave’s sensory deepening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she becomes “its first speaker” and carries the waveform. The cost—she must relinquish analytic control and undergo a bodily shift—reads, if quietly. The scene stays within one coherent window with a single, decisive intensification at the float.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with a causal end: the accumulative cataloging clarifies the prophecy, therefore enabling the decisive refusal to turn the hourglass. Closure occurs on the page with cost as the last grain falls and he walks past the clock into dawn, foreclosing the cycle. Orientation is clean, and setups (jar, buttons, hourglass) all pay off. The price is conceptual but legible: disobedience, risk to the city’s managed decline, and stepping into uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: the meet → coded transfer → revelation (“she’s alive”) → narrowing pressure (network closing in) → charged decision to move. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he forecloses safety by erasing the map and commits to action with felt risk. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and no causality slips. The price is legible on-page as personal peril and relinquished caution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: environmental rhythms (chain, slosh, drip, hammering) cohere toward a cadence break that reconfigures the promise. Closure is on the page: the bell and the steady hands after the knot loosens mark a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when), and the single-scene structure supports the ending without stray threads. The ferry’s readiness provides a concrete hinge between inner revision and outward action.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the thrum intensifies with acts of care, culminating in the channel repair and a resonant cadence shift to peace. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the lantern glass + bee paths form coherent, escalating patterning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—kindness as temporal anchor—made legible by the subsiding thrum and restored flow. The on-page cost is modest, which trims peak impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the nightly ritual densifies until a small but decisive cadence shift occurs (the blinds open a fraction). Closure lands as Charged Poise with a felt cost (time, cold, effort) and a reweighted option set. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and causality holds: last petal falls → new tool/tactic → repeated effort → response. The scale of change is modest but meaningfully alters the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from brittle shards → immersion → anchored repricing. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the stone circle ritual ties cause to effect without gimmick. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he accepts solitude with cost (“He was alone, but he was not empty.”). Slight neatness in articulation keeps it shy of the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain → installation → sunburst refraction → placement of the spiral. Orientation is clean early; the closure lands on the page with the object’s surrender as visible cost. The final reconfiguration (“the thread…to be woven into”) is felt through image and act, not just stated. Minor neatness keeps it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: the virulent transmission prompts her because/therefore choice to deploy the counter‑signal, leading to on‑page social de‑escalation. Orientation is clean by 120 words, and the single‑scene pressure line is coherent. Closure lands via a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: slight calming in the quad and a resolved commitment to continue. The cost is more thematic than material, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: entry → organ chord → mutiny escalates → focus through compass → keystone transfix → chamber/folio. Closure is an on-page decisive change with the environment locking into stability, enabling access to the “key.” Orientation is crisp early, and no props teleport; setups (journals, keystone, compass) pay off. The cost is experienced in-scene (crushing pressure, sanity fraying), though not lasting, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the quarry and ribbon enter as opposites; density and pressure build through the ritual until the scratch reweights the scene. Closure lands on the page as a decisive physical act that reframes the killer as void and yields an emotional cost (“a sharp, aching sorrow”). Orientation is clear early, and the pattern taught (unifying opposites) pays off structurally in the end. The persistent constraint (face blindness) shapes method and meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain: journals → coded stanzas → micro‑vortex → weeping rock → copper key → logbook → call to Archives. Closure lands as a decisive change in stance and options (from private suspicion to formal challenge), with a conceptual repricing of history. The cost is implied (institutional backlash, storm risk) more than dramatized in the final beat, softening impact. Orientation is crisp from the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clear within the first lines, and the accumulative/textural drive holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: he commits to “playing the secret,” reweighting his options with a palpable before/after. Cost is felt but subtle, centered on abandoning the safety of “never” rather than a concrete price. The scene is cleanly contained with a meaningful final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a largely causal lens, Elias’s deliberate “haunting” leads to worker unease, a CEO confrontation, then withdrawal—causality holds even with the added market downturn. The ending’s conceptual repricing (refusing cycles of taking) lands on‑page with a charged, quiet cost. Some resolution energy leaks to external forces (funding loss), slightly diluting his agency in the final turn. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard compression reads legible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is tight: set-up (telegram + RR Lyrae), descent, witnessing, repricing, and dawn writing. The accumulative/textural lens holds—patterns of light accrete into meaning—culminating in a conceptual turn (the glyphs as lament). Closure lands on the page with a visible shift of aim and felt cost. Slightly low pressure in the middle keeps it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: ritual → expanding circles → discovery of the nexus → unbending → confession release → seed planting. Orientation is immediate and stable; the lens (Causal) holds through closure with cost legible in her expenditure of life force and the after-cost of emotional unguarding. The on-page confession provides a decisive reconfiguration and narrows options. No soft resets or coincidences resolve the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: her connection → warning → logical key → created vector → shared stabilization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: options reweighted by a new, stable path while constraints persist. The cost is on-page (physical burn, ongoing root-binding, the still-broken covenant), even as hope clarifies. Orientation is clean; the single-scene structure tightens once and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: threat to Elara’s sapling → Aris selects a precise memory → offers it as substance → void recedes → card reweighted and planted. Orientation is immediate and consistent; single scene, single POV, one dominant stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis, with on‑page cost (surrendered memory) and persistent constraint (he must return with more). The chosen lens (causal with quiet lyric cadence) holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean single‑scene arc with a clear accumulative/textural drive: detail density builds to the cloth’s charged rip and a reweighted final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the quarry shifts from wound to place, and the cloth becomes “evidence,” with the cost being the surrender of his fact‑fortress. Orientation is solid early, and the recorder snag provides a physical hinge into the emotional turn. The price is legible on the page at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens from preparation to planting to hum‑shift to luminous sprout, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The ending lands on the page with cost: she forecloses retrieval in favor of translation into a new syntax. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds. Minor reliance on stated belief over dramatized constraint keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: tide and moon cadence build to the smelting and the charged return of serenity. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—cycle fulfilled, price paid, stakes reset—with the cost legible in the burn and the relinquishing of the Smelter. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene coherence never slips. The turn is earned and unitary, though largely inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal spine is clean: discover chamber → understand pearl’s function → conceive reversal → hesitate → crown → broadcast. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a reconfigured world-state, with conceptual cost legible in the renunciation of the bunker’s separative design. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/mission) and the drive lens holds through the end. No teleports or unkept setups; the pearl’s latent radiance pays off precisely where seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens from arrival to graffiti to the wheezing notes to the relinquishment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he re-prices the premise (map/territory) and forecloses a path by leaving the father’s instrument. Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks. The cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern teaching (reverse watch cycles, propagation delays) coheres into a Charged Poise closure as the library dissolves and the messenger approaches. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when, and the two‑letter window). The cost is on the page: time expires; the portal closes, options foreclose, and she must face the dawn with what she caught. Persistent constraints (watch cycles/delays) shape her every move through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: plant memory contradicts the official narrative; the coffee omen reframes destiny; therefore Elias commits treason by cutting the vine and writing the true report, then leaves. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: he forecloses imperial complicity and accepts risk. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single‑scene window holds. The cost is legible on the page (career, allegiance, danger) in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, coherent scene under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is quick and clean. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the soul is gone, but a charged fragment remains, explicitly altering the world of the grotto. The cost is legible in the vanishing outline and the aurora’s tonal shift. Causality is straightforward—find note → infuse → enshrine—without slack or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: dimming Heart‑Bloom → vantage to diagnose → choice to intervene → scalloped channels → visible improvement → conceptual repricing of contentment. Orientation lands early and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure is on‑page with both Decisive Change and a resonant final image. The cost is emotional/traditional rather than material, but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single continuous scene with tight orientation and a coherent build from confession by the embers to the charged dawn decision. Closure lands on the page via a Decisive Change: he unhooks the clasp, sheds the mantle, and walks away reweighted by doubt. The Hybrid drive holds—accumulative atmosphere supports a causal final act—and cost is legible (foreclosing righteous vengeance, giving up his mantle). A slightly clearer link between the choice and the business-ruin plan could have intensified the causal price.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ripple pattern, slow to reverse, culminates in a Conceptual Repricing of “vanishing” that cleanly reweights the premise. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single-scene frame holds. The cost—renouncing the insistence on “here” tied to his sister—is legible in the closing image. Quiet, but the closure lands on the page without a mechanical explain-all.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene coherence and a tight accumulative drive are evident: new frequency → arrowhead → flock mapping → harmonic release. Closure lands on the page with the pulse’s softening and the arrowhead going inert, a clear before/after. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than concrete, but sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: diagnostic failures → despair → unstrap → touch → repricing. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with an on‑page cost (discarded pack) and a clear before/after in stance. Orientation is crisp early, and the keystone setup pays off. The causal chain is simple but clean, with no teleports or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly from lighting the pier to the dive to the silent library to the realization, with each step tightening the focus. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he keeps the vow through a non‑visual “indigo” answer with an emotional cost. The because/therefore is soft but coherent, and the tide/lantern clock underwrites the window.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene structure with clear anchors (who/where/when) and a coherent pressure line: pattern emerges → all-in recalibration → near-failure → breakthrough → conceptual turn. The inferred lens is Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance at closure, culminating in a conceptual repricing of his purpose. Cost is legible via the risk to sensors and the foreclosure of his seeker role. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first image to the final naming; the scene coheres around a single drive and toolchain. Closure lands on the page with cost: he remains heartbroken but is “no longer lost,” a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when) and the dusk clock shapes the tactic. No causality leaks; the crystallization procedure is clearly staged and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation lands early (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: cadence refinement produces a resonant hum leading to the moisture patch. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he rebuilds the song, not the sea, and the world answers with a small, costly promise. Constraints (weak magic, finite stamina, 97 days of attempts) shape tactics and the final image. The cost is legible in “his magic utterly spent” and the narrowness of the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, beats link tightly: resurfaced town → discoveries → archival pursuit → attic reveal → ledger correction → public exhibit. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph; a two‑shard structure holds together chronologically. Closure lands on‑page via the decisive, documented correction with appended evidence, carrying social and familial cost. No major causality gaps or unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clean: orchard → starlings → tree → crystal → sublimation → inner shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when wonder reweights his method and self-concept. Causality is coherent and motivated by prior setup (forgotten passage leads to the flock). The cost is subtle (a relinquishment of control) but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive holds: new data → need to recalibrate silently → risk of shattering the dial → muscle-memory solution → silent warning sent. Orientation is clean early, and the closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (quiet defense achieved, consequences “spreading” while he bears the ache). The cost is more emotional and procedural than material, but it’s legible and tied to a trade-off (power diversion, secrecy). The scene keeps one window and pays off the taught pressure cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: Kael’s decision to proceed despite Jin’s opposition leads directly to vivification and the reweighted end-state. Orientation is clean early (floating dojo, jar, DUPLICATE) and the closure lands on-page with the newborn thought and Kael’s felt cost. No teleports or contrivances; the paradox method is seeded before the act that pays it off. The decisive change (new consciousness) and price (drain, responsibility) are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean causal chain: mysterious box → identification → symbolic inference (Finch) → decision to plant. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: he forecloses a simpler refusal and commits to a long‑term living puzzle with implied cost (time, odor, care). Orientation is crisp from the first lines; single scene containment is honored. Pressure is quiet but coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: the density of sound and memory crescendos to a charged poise ending. Causality is legible (pulls → engine → hallway echo → wife’s recognition) and closure lands in the wife’s tear/smile as a felt reconfiguration. The cost is implied through “pouring his whole being,” not quantified, but sufficient at this scale. Orientation is clean early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure is clean: intruder → pendant temptation → portal wound → renunciation; each turn follows motivated pressure. Closure is an Earned Stasis with visible cost (forgoing home) and a reweighted stance (“waiting to see what the morning would bring”). Orientation is firm early; the single‑POV window and one transition through sleep remain coherent. The situational lens holds without contradiction and the final suppression act lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal spine: repeated failures narrow options to the final fragment, triggering the method reversal and the crozier’s dissolution into light. Orientation is clean from the outset; the nexus, crozier, and goal are anchored early. Closure lands on the page with cost—the sacred object is unmade—and a reconfiguration of method and meaning. The Hybrid drive leans causal to the end and holds steady.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: pressure builds via perigee and widening channels to a pattern break where silence is “carved away.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—listening for absence—on the page. Causality is clean and motivated by her tactical choices. Cost is present (system strain, risk of overwhelm) but conceptually weighted more than concretely paid.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive holds: noticing patterned starlight/frost → reinterpreting static → composing a binding signal → return with reweighted reality. Orientation is swift and firm, and the closure is on-page with a concrete before/after. The knowledge leap is slightly convenient but seeded by repeated pattern cues. Cost proof: the ending’s restored world papered over for others leaves Finn altered and alone.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: memory alters → thread darkens → moiré intensifies → eruption → reconfiguration into a cage. Closure lands on the page with cost; the final image forecloses freedom as he’s “woven himself into the illusion.” Orientation is clear early, and causality holds within the story’s rules. The decisive change is a strong Conceptual Repricing with an Earned Stasis hue.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence—inciting arrival of Visitors → secret research via edge geometry → pattern discovery → council presentation—links cleanly and culminates in a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands in the council scene with options reconfigured, though cost remains mostly implied (professional risk, civic upheaval). Orientation is firm from the opening and no causality seams show.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal flow is crisp: pulse detection → approach → translation → physiological de-escalation → signal fades. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise with the cost paid in Leo’s surrender to calm and Elias’s renunciation of acclaim. The accumulative/textural lens holds via rhythm shifts driving turns. Stakes resolve quietly but decisively on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: tide window → blocked corridor → phase transition → insertion of the fleck → release. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (risk, surrender of the ghosts, his solitude). Orientation is crisp by ~120 words. A touch more on the live clock in the middle beat could have tightened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear single‑scene accumulative drive: ritual attempts → pattern coalescence → conceptual repricing. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early, and the taught method pays off causally. Closure is on‑page (“The architecture…”) and reweights her life; the cost is largely conceptual (choosing meaning in absence), credible for this scale. Slightly soft pressure on consequence keeps it just shy of 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: long study → observed murmuration as syntax → alignment → canyon’s sudden silence → single true tone. Closure is a conceptual repricing: language lives in matter and can be voiced again; the on‑page beat (silence then tone) decisively reconfigures the world’s rule set. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is felt as the canyon’s annihilated noise rather than a personal loss, keeping it just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: undercover infiltration → witnessing the ritual → repriced understanding → renunciation. Closure is Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses exposure and personal reclamation in favour of safeguarding the garden, with the cost articulated on the page. Orientation is crisp within the first paragraph, and the scene holds a single, coherent window. No plot seams or retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: locust shell → weeks of experimentation → soft, pulse‑driven music → Wardens escalate → vines reclaim → orchard revives. Orientation is clean from the opening sky‑bridge through the descent to the Mother Tree. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and conceptual repricing (“not about destroying the old…”), with cost hinted in bodily depletion and immediate risk. Minor note: the cost is felt but not deeply sustained after the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: mapping absences → timed bottle release → blind network → transfer → confirmation. Orientation is clean early; pressure coheres around the countdown and the drones’ hum returning. Closure lands on the page with a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend: the bluebird ping and tonal shift from brittle to weighted silence make the before/after legible. The cost is primarily risk and resource expenditure (storm spent), subtle but sufficient at this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density and patterning (hush → bells → voice) tighten to a resonant reconfiguration where silence becomes listening. Closure lands on-page with cost: he breaks a decade of silence to sing as the bells peak. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when anchored by the train and vocation). The cause-effect through-line (find shard → prepare setting → crown → sing) is clean without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and sensory pressure increase to a charged glimpse, then settle into an earned stasis. Causality is clean (arrangement → thrum → vision → collapse), with a modest on‑page cost (near‑miss, tremor, continued solitude). Orientation is strong from the outset; closure is a credible Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual accrues toward the fog morning as a decisive intensification; the ending manifests a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the object rules stay consistent. Closure lands on-page as the presence vitalizes, with the long pursuit reweighted. The on-page cost at the end is soft but legible via the life already spent.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: tension condenses toward the first star, then the humming and dissolution create a clear cadence shift to release. Closure lands on the page: the lock unravels, the idea departs, and the woman’s longing is replaced by charged silence (a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost). Orientation is solid from the outset; causality is coherent within the fable logic. The price—letting the symphony go into the world rather than “return” to the son—is legible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: anomaly detected → approach → rule break → memory key → reweighted mission. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, and the closure lands on-page with cost (ache, renunciation of method purity). The beat sequence tightens once meaningfully with the anomaly and culminates in a conceptual repricing (“work was finally beginning”). No dropped setups or convenience patches.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene pressure coheres cleanly under an accumulative lens, culminating in an Earned Stasis/RR: Elara refuses the immediate “return” in favor of rebuilding. The cost is legible on the page (forgoing the map’s implied route; accepting the slow work). Setups like the cube and the “forget your mother’s face” key sharpen options without breaking orientation. The final image reweights the premise with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the build from mist‑threshold to essence capture to planting coheres and closes cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration (world re‑vibrant). Orientation is solid early, and the single scene holds. The primary weakness is cost: the restoration lands without a felt price, making the before/after legible but low‑risk. The beat sequence remains satisfying if quiet, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear orientation from the first lines; single scene; pressure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: a knot released, ambient pressure eased, and the charged transfer of the needle. Cost is legible (exhaustion, ongoing burden) and the final image tightens options (“thousands more”). The causal line within the ritual (choose knot → tease → release) is clean without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the side-by-side film study deepens pressure and leads to a conceptual repricing of the tear as a threshold. Orientation is crisp early (workshop, archives, specific reels), and causality flows: observation → clue (lichen seam) → revaluation → annotated stance. Closure lands in the final pen mark with a felt, if quiet, cost: she chooses recognition over breach. The cost is subtle but legible through her deliberate refusal to open what someone re-sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → note → realization → renunciatory choice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: “I would leave the object where it was,” with the cost legible in the relinquishment. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single transition to the surface is clean. The persistent constraint (the globe-as-anchor) shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene structure is clean: lightning cues the window, encoding proceeds, thunder ends it, and the reply lands. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with intensifying pattern density culminating in a reweighted final image and a felt price (its temporariness). Orientation is crisp early and all set-ups (bolt plate, glyph language) pay off. Stakes remain intimate rather than fraught, but closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: elevator ascent frames time; sunlight sparks the goggles tactic; the diary decodes; the vellum unfolds; the discovery reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a burdened vow to guard the secret. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and all set‑ups pay off. Cost is subtle but legible in the trespass and chosen secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a sequence of cloud-readings intensifies toward the noctilucent fractal that reweights meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he shifts from castaway to curator—tied to on‑page perception. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why). Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible in the acceptance that his work is done.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: coin → lock → obsidian → heartwood → sky, with the demolition clock tightening options. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: a universe contained as the outer world collapses, with the sanctuary’s loss as cost. Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc stays coherent. Minor softness: the outcome’s external consequences are implied rather than tested, but the cost is still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift and clear (airship, sky, apprentice, goal), and the causal chain holds: frustration → clue (hopscotch wear) → decoding via phrasebook → pattern recognition in starlings → sighting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the premise (the “stranded” light is navigating) paired with a decisive change in status (“not just an apprentice”). The cost is mostly conceptual (years of isolation repurposed rather than relieved), which keeps the cadence quiet but valid. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore links are legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: prophecies → chamber of blinding mirrors → vial uncapped to cast eclipse → revealed keyhole → gear-lock engagement → Orrery revives. Closure is a decisive on-page change with a conceptual cost implied in breaking the last-eclipse vial, though the price isn’t fully tallied. Orientation is crisp from the outset. One scene, one dominant stake, and a tight central action deliver coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is tight: chalk → reexamination → bell → timed ascent → resonance → clear flight path. Closure lands decisively on the page with a felt price (perilous climb, coordination under wind and eclipse). The pattern of messages teaches the logic, so the bell’s payoff reads earned. Minor convenience in the bell’s planetary function is countered by fore‑setup through the diagram.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: the thrum → translation → energy drain → dissolution creates a coherent tightening. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with visible cost: “the last of his energy, his very essence, poured into the pattern,” followed by the pane dissolving and his fading. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph (who/where/when) and never wobbles. The causal weave between lullaby, nested patterns, and reweighted world fabric is legible and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive is clean: horn → urgency → assembly → activation → path appears → traveler escapes → tool spent. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: a life saved at the cost of the nut’s energy and his deepened chill, returning him to bound duty with a reweighted quiet. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. No loose setups or convenient turns undermine the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear single‑scene accumulative structure: present‑tense observation → foam analysis → reframe of “divergence” → charged decision to write. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with felt cost (grief persists; control foregone). Orientation is clean from the outset, and causality holds within the chosen lens. The epiphany edges declarative in one line, preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: measured absences gather toward the discovery of the unbroken tree, then a decisive incision and moonlight pour reconfigure meaning. Closure is on-page with cost—the deliberate wound transforms possibility from absence to charged readiness, echoed by the library-wide tremor. Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent. The cost is more conceptual than perilous, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a causal lens, each move follows: fossil → taste → map → grotto → subsumption → dissolution → altered touch. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (“an agony that scoured him clean”) and a decisive before/after image with the Warlord. The two‑shard structure (fortress → desert/pavilion) remains coherent and propulsive. No orientation debt; set‑ups (tidal pools, memory‑taste) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors (clock tower, console, headset) and a coherent Accumulative/Textural drive: layered languages reshape the sonic field. Closure lands on the page as the roar transforms into harmony, with the weight’s stillness sealing the change. The because/therefore chain is less causal than patterned intensification, fitting the lens. Cost is felt but light, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with clean orientation and a coherent because/therefore chain from preparation to cognitive remapping to stabilization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she alters her mind and carries the dream forward. The cost is felt (identity threat, physical pain) but remains subtle at the end. The accumulative lens holds through cadence tightening at the memories’ resistance and the machine’s stabilization.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong causal chain: inversion window → entry via threshold → puzzle reframed as perspective → acquisition → escape as gravity returns. Closure lands on the page with cost (physical peril and a charged responsibility), cleanly contained to one scene. Orientation is immediate and consistent; the Hybrid lens with Causal dominance holds. The only limitation is that the cost remains more conceptual than materially life-altering on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the performance layers toward a charged cadence, culminating in the reconfigured silence (“not an absence but a presence”). Orientation is immediate and stable; causality coheres via method discovery → iterative music-making → final rest. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: she relinquishes authorial control to listen, and the world’s silence is repriced. The cost is quiet but legible in the “hollow space” being filled and the deliberate restraint at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: attention to hums/silences densifies until the alignment manifests and reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean early, and the closure is on the page with a cost—the reweighted identity and letting the stone fall. The decisive intensification is the visible aurora syncing with the decoded rhythm. Stakes are modest but coherent and resolved without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative build toward a clean on-page closure: the tuned absence-tone and the audible click. Orientation is immediate; causality holds from set-up through the climax. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he preserves devotion without violating privacy) with a modest but legible cost (renunciation of reading). The fireworks’ entrance tightens the window effectively without gimmicks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pressure builds through sensory density to a cadence shift where she filters the wind and reweights her stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the still point she cultivates forecloses the path of avoidance at a real cost (overwhelm and pain). Orientation is clean from the opening (treetop village, conservatory, seed, seasonal shift). The turn is singular but sufficient at this length and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate and clean: who, where, when, and the “Inversion” window are established early. The causal chain holds—gravity flips, the river becomes the path, the arrow guides, the shard is taken, and the escape beats the returning gravity. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing: the shard reframes “cure” as memory of resilience Elara carries back. Cost is present but modest (time pressure, possible harm to the source), which keeps this shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: survey → patch discovery → tactic pivot → convergence model → epicenter and realized cause → conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure (conceptual repricing/earned stasis) lands with the “weight” of knowledge as price. The explanatory reveal risks an “explain‑everything” feel, but it follows earned investigation, not deus ex. Stakes cohere to a single dominant drive and pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the chisel’s strike cues the ritual, the aurora enables the method, and the hush dissolves—clean because/therefore linkages within the chosen mode.

The cost at closure remains more conceptual than felt, which slightly tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: placement → uncasing → playing → shimmer → insight. Closure is a conceptual repricing with on‑page cost; the final image reweights the guardianship’s purpose. Orientation is clean, single-scene cohesion intact. No dangling setups or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, tight progression: arrival → setup of method → press activation → stamped card → aftermath. The accumulative/textural lens holds; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing when grief is reframed as “shape” with grief persisting as cost. Orientation is clear from the opening, and no causality breaks. The vanishing/birth of constellations brackets the action to give a crisp cadence shift at silence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the aurora’s intensification → pendant resonance → suspended moment → crystalline germination yields a coherent deepening that reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reconceives his role and path with a visible before/after (jitter → calm, wonder embraced). Cost is conceptual more than material, but legible in the foreclosed “routine hand‑off” path. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: cold → prism placement → dawn refraction → frost patterns → schematic revelation → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the one-scene structure tightens cleanly to the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the puzzle‑map and loom’s price accrete toward the final sealing weave. Closure lands on the page with cost when the tapestry flares and she is left unable to recall why—visible payment for success. Orientation is clear early (orchard, bamboo, loom) and the single scene coheres. No causality breaks; the bead insertion and locking threads cleanly trigger the end state.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: off‑world theft → failing arches → mine descent → memory barter → geode activation → arch stabilizes. Closure lands on the page with tangible cost (lost tastes and breezes) and a decisive external change (blue‑traced arch). Orientation is clean early and the lens remains causal throughout. The single scene holds scope and pays off its set‑ups without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal throughline under a Causal lens: the rising “tide,” shard use, identification of the correct layer, realization of cross‑world cause, and the decisive redirection. Closure lands on the page with cost: Elara’s world vanishes, the echoes end, and the shard’s purpose is fulfilled. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, and the single‑scene window holds. The only soft spot is the relative ease of the redirection act, though the cost image partly compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: lamp fails → urgent voyage → ascent → discovery of goodbye → repair → farewell stones/beam reprise. Orientation is immediate and stable; the piece holds a causal drive lens through closure. The closure lands on the page with cost (light restored; relationship foreclosed), and no contrivances resolve pressure. The logbook line and final sea‑glass image elegantly seal the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent Accumulative/Textural drive; pressure builds as the storm approaches and the apparatus strains. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: he succeeds yet discovers an unintended prophetic dimension that now shapes him. The cost (exhaustion, device strain, relinquished control) is legible on the page. Turns are smooth rather than sharp, but the cadence shift at dawn satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation → anomaly of light → confrontation → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what) and the closure lands with a reframed rule (“stories refract through you”) tied to concrete images (wing, sun trails). Cost is primarily conceptual—relinquishing an old explanatory frame—credible but not sharply priced in action. The donor heart throughline coheres the sequence without late rule-changes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere cleanly: anomalous sound → retrieval → analysis → storm/moonlight breakthrough → archival placement. Orientation is immediate and stakes remain legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: sorrow recontextualized and housed, with a felt conceptual cost (he curates rather than cures). The because/therefore chain is intact without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: caretaking accrues lyrical fragments, culminating in the sung ritual that births a dawn. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the closure lands on‑page with a reconfigured world (the tiny sun, realm warmed). The cost is subtle—fragility of the nascent sun and the long burden of memory—yet present in the “most delicate task” and her bound purpose. Sequence is tight with no causal leaks or late rule giveaways.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the click at the door tightens pressure, “staying while leaving” shifts tactics, Elara’s sorrow reframes the stake, and the final image reweights meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he forecloses immediate social engagement but reframes shelter as shared. Orientation is clean early; causality threads are coherent. The cost is subtle but legible in the refusal to reverse his decision and the loneliness he accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene structure is tight: gardening → interruption → uncloak via story and object → patrolman’s memory → altered stasis. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis): being “seen” shifts the field without absolving risk, and she resumes with reweighted quiet. Causality holds cleanly, and the cost (risk of punishment, relinquishing secrecy) is legible on the page. Orientation is clear from the outset; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural drive holds. The closure lands on the page with cost: the vow extinguishes as he captures a single tone; the slide is placed in “Extinguished,” and the ledger line becomes both tombstone and seed. Pressure coheres as the light falters and frequencies scatter to a last flare. The final window image reweights the action without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each failed tactic begets the next, culminating in the targeted deception that collapses the deal. Orientation is swift and clean; the ending lands on the page with Eva’s rejection of Silas and the tossed fob. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (Elara’s ethical trade and risk), but it’s legible in the charged final image. Structure is tight for the length with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres: detection → carriers converge → aurora intervention → quiet after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the phenomenon isn’t “fixed,” it’s reweighted, and Elara’s frame shifts. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the lens holds. Cost is modest but legible in the relinquishment of a tidy mechanism for a larger map.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Causal. Each beat links cleanly—patron laughter → cave retreat → painting-as-key realization → deliberate safecracking → box opened → tools reprice his path. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost implied (leaving lucrative replication). The pattern is coherent, with the broken lock and earlier failure shaping present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: find fragments → reassemble → decode → descend → the postal plate opens the vault → conceptual turn to seed truth. Closure reads as a decisive reorientation (CR/Earned Stasis hybrid), with a final action of planting. The cost is mostly conceptual and anticipatory rather than dramatized, slightly softening the landing. Orientation is anchored early and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: preparation → rare updraft → symphony → self‑costing release → earned quiet. Closure lands with visible cost on the page—the sculpture sublimates as mist, foreclosing any repeat and reweighting his purpose. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality slips. The ending’s Earned Stasis (guardian resuming his watch, paid in the sculpture’s dissolution) reads decisive and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: alerts → retrieve box → open during geomagnetic cover → containment via geothermal regulators → jewel → precise “burn” escape. Orientation is clear early (glass‑domed desert rose farm; warden AIs; magnetic shift) and held.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: listening → clues → pattern recognition → opening the mailbox. Orientation is quick and clear, and set-ups (the locket; the unusual keyhole; the neighbors’ hints) pay off cleanly. Closure lands on-page with the click and the garden bequest, though the cost is soft (time and tension instead of a hard sacrifice). The official letter’s deflation neatly completes the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, closing in a Resonant Reconfiguration as the hum modulates and the presence consolidates. Orientation is clean from the first lines; stakes stay coherent. The because/therefore is soft but intact: failed logic → embodied tactic → surrender to chance → system responds. Cost rests in concept more than concrete consequence, keeping this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear Causal/Accumulative spine: whale → gravity pockets → coffee map → chamber rite → brief retrieval → loss → repriced hope. Orientation is crisp by 120 words and the closure lands on the page with cost (only one fragment; pocket vanishes). The before/after is legible: proof replaces doubt, reconfiguring his ongoing quest. No broken linkages or convenience saves; the pattern taught early is respected.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through a density shift—mapping gaps, expanding pockets of silence—toward a Charged Poise ending where the hush settles and a fragile cost is signaled (“a fragile blanket laid over a dangerous fire”).

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain-cleansed night → descent via moon reflections → immersion among fireflies → audacious whistle → release/return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: he re-prices “participation” and sees his tools as a way to join the pattern. Orientation is clear early; causality between images is coherent. Cost is subtle but legible in the relinquishment of influence for a quieter purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean causal chain: orchard anomaly → station → shredded letters → engineered flaw → alignment at antenna → stillpoint reveal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the “curse” is reframed as physics—on the page via the shimmering circle. The cost is largely conceptual (displacing community myth) rather than dramatized, which limits impact. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single-scene flow holds.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly (signals → followers → Great Storm → two-voice ultimatum → chest opens → star map through cobalt glass → third option → broadcast). Closure is a Decisive Change with a light Conceptual Repricing in the gold-versus-blue final image. The chest unlocking at the crisis edge reads as convenient coincidence resolving the bind, dulling earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a gathering of sounds culminates in a reweighted silence and a transfigured purpose. Orientation is clean from the opening and the closure lands on the page with the seashell and the acceptance of “not restored, but transfigured.” The cost—refusing to resurrect the past in favor of a new, charged now—reads clearly. Structure is tight, with one continuous build to a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal drive holds: discordant hum → retrieve key → attune and mirror → violent lock → subsume with cost. Closure lands on‑page as a decisive change with a felt toll (sweat‑soaked, trembling, the island nearly cracking). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The throughline remains tight with no late rule cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the wet viaduct’s reflectivity enables resonance which enables the timed signal, which collapses the system—clean because/therefore linkages. Orientation is clear early (basalt sanctuary over frozen lake; Authority; Lyra’s ascent). Closure is a decisive change: lights die, hum vanishes; the cost is implied in generational patience and risk to the cell. The only hairline slip is that the breaker throw occurs off‑page, but the chain remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens holds: empirical cause chain (flood → discovery → observations → notebook) intertwined with accumulative sensory waves. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the decision to file a non‑conforming report, with conceptual cost to his standing. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The lantern’s reprise as “a cage” reweights the premise without mechanical tying‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the scene tightens through the light‑through‑storm image, reweighting Arthur’s role and culminating in his decision to leave the heart. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; single scene, clean throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a small but legible cost (letting go of the repairman fantasy). Stakes remain interior but coherent and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal spine: decipher “Grip” → redesign wing → launch → fall → actuate and “grip” reality. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost (risk of death, isolation, leaving home), held under a Causal lens. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the bell motif returns as conceptual payoff. Minor expositional scaffolding about the Algorithm doesn’t harm the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: noticing numbers → recalling the mission coordinates → bypassing security → Kael’s interruption → the decisive send. Orientation is clean from the start (role, place, stakes), and the Seraphim-7 key pays off the seeded pattern. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (forwarding the whistleblower file) and clear conceptual/occupational risk. A minor limitation is that the external consequence is implied rather than partially dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a causal lens, the accusation forces Kael to seek evidence, the mirror yields it, and he returns to reconfigure the dynamic on the page. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the crowd releases accusation, Mara reweights anger as fear. The “weighted breath before reply” compresses the clock, though the excursion risks slight plausibility stretch. Costs are emotional rather than material but clear in the final sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds sensory density toward the calving’s “resonant sigh,” which reconfigures her quest in the present. Orientation is clean and single‑scene; the closure is an on‑page recognition that carries conceptual cost (her planned death reframed as dignified severance). No causality breaks; set‑ups (parasols, wind, trawling) pay off in the final image. The constraint is primarily ethical and perceptual, yet it lands decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern of bus → quiet → vineyard reflections holds.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: pavilion distortion → decision → descent → machine → consecration → return. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act (sealing the echo) and a conceptual cost (withdrawing from communal discourse to safeguard purity). Orientation is immediate and stable; the accumulative lens holds through the ritualized steps. The cost is felt, though not deeply dramatized beyond solitude and mental exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seasonal returns, image arcs, and the culminating placement of the final photograph form a coherent build. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the mosaic’s completion reweights the town’s pain with a felt release. Cost is present but soft—primarily the relinquishment of a long-held task. Orientation is crisp from the opening (lavender field, factory ruin, map case).

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single‑POV structure anchored early in a shadowed library “after the last dictionary was printed.” The accumulative/textural lens holds: fragments accrue until a conceptual reweighting lands with the cost of renunciation. The chandelier drop prompts discovery and the weeks montage tightens toward the final stance. Closure is a charged poise/earned stasis: he forecloses publication, bearing a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density builds from junkyard to fog garden to altar, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he chooses presence over capture. Closure lands on-page with cost—he cannot keep the sound; the chalk circle blurs. Orientation is clean early, and causality tracks (forgetting → lost sigil → simpler act). The ending image reweights the premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is immediate and clean, and the causal chain (spinning clock → unworkable dampening → restructure the anchor → lens insertion) holds without seams. Closure lands on the page as a charged poise/earned stasis: the station is saved by being fixed in a single instant, with the explicit price of no more seconds. The lens sacrifice binds personal and system stakes into the same decisive act. No plot amnesia or teleports; the lunar zenith constraint is integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere and ritual choices build toward a charged reunion and quiet death. Orientation is clean early; the causal thread (record shard → research → call → arrival → music → handclasp) stays intact. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vinyl shard’s meaning reweights and the cost (death and long‑delayed reconciliation) is on the page. A single tightening—time closing after the blood work—suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each step—study of inversion, alignment of rings, insertion and push—causes the automaton’s projection, which delivers the noon‑shadow answer; the chain is clean and contained to a single scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: shadows “turned inside out” reframes the premise with a modest but real cost (weeks of relearning, the post‑warp constraint). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clear CR closure: the tooth’s discovery reweights the world; the final star‑chart act fixes a before/after. Orientation is clean (maze → garden; later, the oak table at night). Cost is legible in the acceptance of having wronged Elara and in the surrender of singular certainty. The two‑shard structure tightens coherently toward the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: polishing accrues until the twilight slit triggers the glow; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (quiet light replacing fire’s hunger). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the one scene structure is tight. Cost is present but gentle—labor, restraint, and a past wound rather than a sharp on‑page sacrifice—keeping this just short of the 9‑band. The final image reweights the premise without mechanical explain‑all.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the drip pattern discovery and pendant exchange reweight the dominant stake from fossilization to renewal. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—on the page—when he closes his fingers around the pendant with a new frame. Cost is legible: she relinquishes a talisman of permanence to propose change. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure tightens without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: mist → cameos → gale → clearing → burial, each step narrowing stance toward an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the last “untarnished hope” is buried—and reconfigures his role from author to keeper. Orientation is early and clean; the single transition to the desk pays off the feral nexus frame. The final image (“fertile ground”) reprices the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the song’s density and the moon’s window crescendo to visions and a reweighted reality. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the ritual’s success constitutes a resonant reconfiguration—the world is retuned and the remedy is remembering. The cost is subtle but present: the alignment passes; responsibility to teach remains; the hush transforms. Stakes and closure land without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens from bone‑listening to ignition. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he sacrifices starlight and stillness to guide the child, then returns to wait, costs intact. Orientation is clear early (orchard, crater, global crisis) and all set‑ups pay off (plate, paper, starlight, seal). The cost is legible in “pouring a piece of his own stillness” and the implied finitude of starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation and drive are crisp from the outset; the accumulative build (pins, angles, ledger) coheres to a concrete closure. The Decisive Change lands on the page: reassembly and activation yield an echo. The cost is primarily time and austerity, which is felt but soft. The lens remains stable and the final activation reweights prior observation without a causality wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the ritual intensifies until grief becomes stone and is placed into the mosaic. Orientation lands early (who/where/when) and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—his role persists, but the hush “deepens,” with a felt cost of solitude. Each step follows clearly (feel burden → draw wisp → align with Alphena → calcify → set). The quiet cadence shift at the end reweights the premise with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: sound and ritual build from rain → simmer → whistle → first cut → hush, culminating in a charged poise. Orientation is clean early; single scene, single POV. Closure lands on the page as she enshrines the lesson in wood and accepts the ongoing price of containment. The live clock (kettle) and the memory method cohere causally into the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from general scavenging to a charged object that reconfigures the stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Integration: “It was my fault,” followed by a shift from negotiating to bearing witness. Orientation is clean from the opening and the cost (abandoning the hope of exoneration) is explicit. The causal thread (find wheel → memory crystallizes → confrontation → acceptance) is coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal links are clean: discovery of sextant fragment → decoding hidden grid → rerouted power → activation → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: hope reframed as rerouting latent potential, crystallized under the star field. The cost is implied (risk, time, rule‑bending) rather than dramatized in a pinch, keeping the climax quiet rather than pressured. Orientation is strong and single‑scene cohesion holds.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of silence/rain imagery builds to a cadence shift when light strikes the bells. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—the dream is given rest in the open and the weight in his chest reconfigures into a “foundational stone.” Orientation is clear from the outset; causality is simple but coherent. The cost (foreclosing the carillon dream) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: instinct → abutment → grapple → lockbox → journal → revaluation. Orientation lands early, the radio’s quiet clock creates a persistent constraint, and the closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing with legible cost (grandfather’s chosen disgrace reweights Kael’s quest). The dawn/radio silence punctuates the turn without contrivance. Minor softness in external jeopardy keeps it just below the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, snow, fulgurite, and tactile study build toward a conceptual repricing—recognizing a philosophy encoded in knots and preserving it. Orientation is clean from the opening. Closure lands via the realized “phrase” and the charged act of recording it, though cost remains subtle (time/cold/solitude rather than a sharp trade-off). The single scene is coherent with a clear cadence shift as fog recedes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the deepening from garden to projection to realization lands as a conceptual repricing: healing as containment rather than erasure. Orientation is clean early, and the single transition is legible and purposeful. Cost is present as a sharpened solitude and the acceptance of pain’s permanence. The structure is tight for the length with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: discovery → assembly → incubation → hatching → song reconfigures the world’s cadence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: beauty is hybrid, not resurrected, with cost to Kaelen’s original ideal. Orientation is solid from the opening and held; single POV and scope fit. A touch more on-page decision at the final turn could have deepened the causal feel, but the RR/CR is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: lagoon → fire → lagoon builds to a charged poise/CR closure. Causality is clear (radio call → fireground focus on the banyan → grafting with the red thread → post-scene repricing at the lagoon). The cost (sacrificed coin/thread) is on the page and shapes the ending image. A single tightening beat (using the talisman’s thread) lands cleanly; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: geese pause → star alignment → placement on pedestal → rotation → click → fountains’ whisper. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s memory unsticks and the geese depart, signaling the window’s end. The cost is implied (long preparation and a single shot at the window) more than dramatized in-scene, slightly muting impact. Orientation and single-scene containment are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonar searching → null beacon → gear encounter → conceptual reframe → new broadcast. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (abandoning the calculative legacy for self-expenditure). Orientation is clean early, and the single scene coheres. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but it lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (butterflies, ribbons, etched lines) accrete toward a conceptual repricing at the nexus cut. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the storm serves as the cadence break that tightens focus. Closure lands with a concrete artifact (the abstract web on slate) and a renunciation (no name/date). The cost is subtle but legible: he abandons the conventional endpoint to honor a networked grief.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught and held: present-tense ritual, reverie shard, and the cadence shift at the pendulum’s restart. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “the pause was over” and a “burden correctly shouldered,” with the cost of ongoing penance legible. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality slips. The only limit is that the decisive act remains imaginal rather than enacted, though the frame makes that choice coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmosphere to decoding, to map, to conceptual revaluation of the sovereign case. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he reunites intention and path and constructs a shrine-like shelf. The cost is conceptual (accepting a future that never arrived) rather than dramatized loss, but it lands. Causality is tidy and coherent without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Situational with a Charged Poise closure. The scene coherently narrows to one pressured decision; cost is articulated on the page (“to force hardship on a generation”). Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the analytical pruning establishes the causal bedrock for the final act of setting pen to page. The quiet cadence lands without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual → capture → conceal → reveal → charged stasis. Orientation is crisp within the first paragraph; single scene coherence is strong. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with on‑page cost framed (risk, isolation), even if not acutely tested this night. The final image reweights the premise (stories as light nested in music) without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression through rooms and ritual culminates in a charged poise at the chair’s stilling. Orientation is clear early; cause/effect is ritual‑clean rather than plot‑twisty. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost: the peace is explicitly an illusion, and the grief’s return is inevitable. The linkage of steps (kiln → urn → stillness) coheres and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the intrusion of the girl crystallizes pressure around competing narratives. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses proselytizing and embraces archivist solitude, paid for with isolation and futility (“not the world’s teacher… its memory”). Orientation is clean and the scene contains one decisive tightening. The cost is legible in the final image of the cog boxed among other relics.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece coherently builds from failure to a pared‑back method, landing in a charged, unified hum. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he renounces addition for subtraction, and the group yields pride to breathe together. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single transition is clean. The cost is largely conceptual (letting go of history and words), felt but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal frame: celestial alignment triggers growth; tasting reveals poisonous history; pruning edits emphasis; transformed plant yields hope. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (the plant’s reconfiguration and pearlescent fruit) carrying a conceptual cost (editing collective memory). Orientation is immediate and the single-scene arc holds. The cost could be sharpened with a more explicit on-page sacrifice or irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: a single scene where the riddle and realization reweight the city’s crisis into a moral/energetic famine. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the final image of managed lightning and the unopened box. Orientation is crisp and props track. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is swift and clean, and the two-shard structure (night act, next evening’s effect) stays coherent. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: patterned acts culminate in a cadence shift and conceptual repricing. Closure lands via the flamingo/flowers tableau recoding the protagonist’s goal with a realigned premise. Cost is subtle but legible as a relinquished identity and risk accepted in the trespass.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Causal lens: new knowledge (the “weakness” is a gill) therefore reconfigures the mission and compels the decisive burial. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change that forecloses a path with implied social cost. No teleports or rule breaks; set‑ups (ampoule, membrane) pay off. The cost is conceptual yet legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: proofs → predicted nexus → the roll → rupture → repricing of the world. Closure lands on the page with cost (“physical ache of regret”), and the persistent constraint (infinite staircase) still governs the final stance. The piece holds a Hybrid drive with a causal core and a final conceptual repricing. No orientation debt; the single scene is coherent and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: setup → ritual → activation → silence → response. Closure lands on-page via a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city answers, reweighting Elias’s premise with emotional cost made legible in the long, doubting wait. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single-scene build is coherent. The price (risk of public foolishness/loneliness) is palpable without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because the waterfall freezes and fractures threaten collapse, Alistair studies the ice, recalls archival knowledge, persuades the council, and directs the singing that triggers a controlled thaw; the waterfall’s return is an on‑page Decisive Change. Cost is implicit (risk of collapse, social resistance) rather than dramatized as a loss. Orientation is crisp and the chain holds cleanly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal drive is clean: low tide → final assembly → lever pull → immediate temporal reversal effects. Orientation is established early (lighthouse workshop at low tide). Closure lands on the page with cost as his “lines … fading” and the charged image of stepping into an “unwritten past.” The lens holds through a decisive act that reconfigures options and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: notes → navigation → mirror confrontation → confession → activation of clasp → dissolution. Orientation is clean from the first sentence (funhouse, resuscitation context). Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing (void reframed), and the advisor’s silence marks aftermath. Cost is legible in the acceptance of a persistent void and the loss of the advisor.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: omen in clouds → mapping on cedar → timed strikes → storm reweighted. Orientation is immediate and the single‑scene arc lands with a felt aftereffect. Closure is a decisive reconfiguration: the squall’s violence converted into a sustaining rhythm and an earned quiet. Cost is modest (exertion, risk), but legible within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: pattern recognition → translation → performance → response → map revelation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (doom acknowledged; whistle cracked), and the lens holds. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) and the single-scene focus avoids clutter. The final reconfiguration retrofits prior beats (the expedition, the sealed gate) with coherent, earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: Aris’s chosen tactic (historical parallels) narrows Elara’s options and produces the decisive handover. Orientation is immediate, single scene holds, and the closure carries conceptual cost. The “click” of the latches pins the change on the page. Minor reservation: the societal cost is mostly implied rather than directly biting the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal spine: solitary mission → fissure found → inkwell lost → recovery → sealing completes the intention → final stasis of purpose. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to bearing witness at visible cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (drawbridge, marsh, pavilion) with a clean two‑shard return to the hut. Hybrid drive with accumulative lyric pressure at the end holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → altered conditions → re‑examination of the mark → retrieval of the stamp → proof → reweighted history → quiet vow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing coupled with earned stasis (refusal to announce), with a felt cost in isolation and opposing official history. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the lens holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine (pilgrimage → polishing → basilica → dream → reconfiguration) carried by accumulative lyric pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream reframes grief into a bearable current, paid for by the acknowledgment of an impossible future. Orientation is clean early; set-ups (gem, basilica) resolve precisely at the climax. The price is legible in the “promise forever broken” line that reweights the final folding act.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: array overdrive forces a cooling window; she exploits it; diagnostics close in; the breaker resets as the solution spikes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she gains a target (the resonance) with the conceptual cost of reorienting grief into pursuit. Orientation is strong from the outset; the scene stays within single POV and one location. The only minor softness is the speed of the “cascading solution,” which leans on genre tolerance rather than on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: pilgrim’s chip → Lyra cue → drone navigation → hidden handle → lens focus → activation. Orientation is crisp within the first lines and the single-scene window holds. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration. The felt cost is light (strain rather than sacrifice), slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: terrace grief → shore search → tactile trigger (gouged oak) → revelation of erasure → decision to rebuild memories. Closure is both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing—the silence becomes a weapon, and he redirects his vocation at personal cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear from the opening. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than enacted, but it lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, legible scene with a clear situational drive: protocol forces a precise, exposed exchange. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—the chains fall, the exchange succeeds, and the final image reweights the past mistake into “dividend of life.” Orientation is crisp by ~120 words, and set‑ups (lockbox, object‑key) pay off causally. The turn is quiet rather than dramatic, but cost and reconfiguration are on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and pressures (poles→cage, couple on water, compass as judge) stack toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean early; the final act reframes options—he stops fleeing and faces the sea—with a visible emotional price. Causality is coherent: guilt → avoidance system → arrival → break of pattern. Quiet but decisive cadence shift lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain: object → archives → coded classifieds → coordinates → cavern → letter → reoriented goal. Orientation is crisp and the drive lens reads Causal with an RR at the end (charged poise toward building a future). The cost is implied—relinquishing sterile peace for a harder path—though not deeply dramatized on page. No teleports or logic gaps in the breadcrumb trail.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from preparation to ritual to surrender, landing in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the throughline never wavers. The closure image—becoming a function of the orchard with Lyra—lands with a felt cost. Causality is lyrical yet clean: spices → scent → presence → acceptance → bonded state.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: image density and motifs build toward a decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost when she unfastens the cloak and vows via a fresh hand-trace, abandoning the hunt for “lost time.” Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why). The price—relinquishing a magical solution and accepting vaporous loss—is legible in the last beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the patterned tending of photos intensifies to the personal final photo, which triggers the aperture opening—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (Scrap‑Ark, command deck, task, object), and each ritual beat coheres toward the end. The price—nearly crushing sorrow and a ship‑shuddering test—is legible at the climax. Closure lands in the charged final image of acceptance opening the dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the chain—detour to alcove → release of light → volcano’s verdant sigh—builds a coherent pattern rather than a mechanical puzzle. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the mountain’s heartbeat steadies and Kael’s quest reframes, with the empty bottles as cost. No causality breaks; coincidence is thematically baked in and does not undercut the end.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → cover → sundial code → signal → distributed coup functions. Orientation is early and solid, and the one-scene structure holds. Closure lands via a decisive reconfiguration (the fort’s control shifts), but the on-page cost is muted—risk is implied rather than dramatized at the end. The inferred lens is Causal and it holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal—vision of the tide triggers preparation; aurora arrival forces the keystone act; the star dust circuit splits the wave. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who/where/when). Closure is a Decisive Change with a felt price (deploying the finite star dust) and a small Resonant Reconfiguration (“borrowed dawn” becomes “his own”). The causal line is tight and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with causal dominance: the found envelope → timed vigil → ping → opening → key/negative → decision, with clean because/therefore links. Closure is a charged poise/incipient decisive change: he ends the vigil and commits to an action with cost (“a new, terrifying journey”). Orientation is clear from the outset; the clock is a persistent constraint shaping tactics. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional but felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: observation of the half‑painted sundial → decoding via needle reflections → fencing sequence → precise final strike → hidden compartment opens. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the drive lens is Causal throughout. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the dial opens, a map is revealed), though the cost is conceptual rather than felt. The waiting clock of the moving shadow provides subtle pressure without a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene layers salvage, backstory, and the poem “arsenal” until the drifters arrive and the stance crystallizes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Silas offers shelter and a poem and the four begin sorting, a clear before/after. Causality is clean and contained to one location and window. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk, commitment), not explicit, which keeps it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: compasses fail → time pressure rises → he decodes the film via music → the doorway opens → he steps through. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a felt cost (abandoning refuge, entering risk). World logic is taught early enough and used consistently; the “film-as-map translated to sound” is foreshadowed and paid off. Slightly soft cost articulation keeps this just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through weather, dream motifs, and cadence until a charged reconfiguration at planting/singing. Closure lands: the seed pulses, blossoms intensify, memory tightens; doubt is reframed, not erased. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than event-punitive; while effective, it reads gentle because success arrives immediately. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening); the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual, weather, tide/wind rule, and climb to the bluff cohere into a single tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—he accepts diffusion over self‑punishment—and it’s on the page. Orientation is crisp early; the tide condition causes the timing rather than a hand‑of‑author coincidence. A hairline neatness in the prophecy‑like instruction keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story executes a powerful and resonant closure, with a clear Decisive Change that lands with felt cost.
