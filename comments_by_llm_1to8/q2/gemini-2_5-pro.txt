  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Aris's repeated observations through the dust-coated pane accumulate density until the orchid moment reweights his stance. The closure—wiping the pane clean and reaching for the shovel—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: he must abandon the filtered comfort and join the messy process. The single meaningful deepening (orchid transfer → connection → action) is sufficient for this length and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen chooses creation over exposure, sealing the ledger in glass with frost patterns etched around it—a decisive renunciation of vengeance that forecloses reporting the smugglers, with the conceptual cost made visible in "the silence that followed" becoming "a conversation she finally understood." Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the week-long frost-reading sequence accumulates density, then the kiln-lighting reweights prior fire-terror into creation-wisdom. Orientation anchors (glass artist, canyon, post-fire) arrive by line 3. One meaningful deepening: the ledger's discovery→frost-pattern recognition→cave location→final artwork progression tightens stakes from survival to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara transforms her trauma into form, forecloses the need to silence it, and closes the tuning fork case—visible cost is exhaustion and the relinquishment of the audible-age tool. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who/where/when), and the accumulative lens holds: each thermal layer deepens the flower's bloom and Elara's internal reckoning. One escalation beat (violet deepens → trauma erupts → weave completes) tightens options under pressure. The choice to "hold onto the flower's violet thread" is motivated by prior particulars. No causality breaks; time and spatial anchors are stable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. The package arrival triggers the descent, and the lens-insertion revitalizes the astrolabe, creating a clear before/after. Closure is a Decisive Change (noise → silence) with felt cost (the immense toll of "occupying impossible spaces" is declared but not shown to foreclose a later option). The orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias fits the lens, but the cost remains abstract ("rarely used due to its immense cost") rather than dramatized on the page, preventing higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's arbor declaration and the community's groundbreaking crystallize a shift from passive consumption to active cultivation, with the donor's seed-and-tools approval charging the final image. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—donations layer meaning until the bell unlocks memory and reweights the stake. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elara, exile community, sanctions). One meaningful deepening (bell discovery → intergenerational bridge) tightens the dominant stake with visible cost (exposure, commitment to labor).

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: breathing cycles build density until the sparks-of-love vision reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ache "changing its nature") with conceptual cost legible in the final image. One slip: the revelation arrives via the device rather than through a protagonist choice that narrows options, slightly weakening agency at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias severs the fragment's hold at visible cost—total memory loss—and the final image reweights all prior material. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what) and the because/therefore chain holds: discovery → consumption → desperate geometrical gambit → disintegration → erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when he aligns the fragment with the maze's paradoxical angles, narrowing options to a single irreversible act. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis: Elara's body remains bound while her purpose takes root, a renunciation with felt cost. The causal lens holds from arrow arrival through key sequence to mechanical activation; each beat narrows options under coherent pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The Cost proof test passes: "Her body was bound, but her purpose was now free" makes the tradeoff undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) at closure. The piece accumulates absences across multiple beats, then compresses them in the forge to yield the crystal; the final reconfiguration—hearing silence instead of the break—reweights prior material with conceptual cost (he contains the pain rather than capturing it). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words. One tightening suffices at this length, and the closure effect is legible. The cost is felt but somewhat oblique: the final paragraph tells us cells "could finally begin to mend" rather than showing a forfeited path or tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the floral reinterpretation, transit to the station, and the jar's acquisition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where Silas recognizes he now holds future rather than past. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Silas, his apartment, the present evening). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—he "did not know if he could ever believe his eyes again"—and the portraits are visibly devalued ("suddenly inert"). One tightening deepening suffices for this length; the cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Situational lens: external collapse (structural failure) forces Elara to crystallize her stance between art-as-anchor and survival. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she abandons the sphere, exits with the bookmark, and the final image ("weighty lightness," river metaphor) reconfigures her frozen grief into forward motion with felt cost (the collapsing sphere, the entombed studio). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening (the groaning structure escalates to STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FAILURE) narrows options and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when quickly (library shelf, acrophobia, three days post-betrayal) and the Drive Lens reads Causal with motivated moves: whispers lead to library, cast yields cipher, cipher yields code. Closure is a Decisive Change—Leo triggers the failsafe, reversing power—but the cost is unclear on the page; Julian's terror is visible, but Leo's own forfeitures or new constraints are absent. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) does not apply; anchors land early. The failsafe's late introduction ("a failsafe Julian himself had designed but forgotten") reads convenient; if this command existed, why wouldn't Julian have guarded or erased it?

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece orients clearly (who: Kaelen; where: watchtower; when: as the final star fades) within the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of sensory detail and the ritual's mounting intensity, culminating in a closure image (the completed glyph) that reweights the opening premise. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Earned Stasis, as Kaelen completes his cycle with visible cost (the flaking gold, the "dying embers" on his fingertips, his "quiet obsession sated"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the star dissolves and "the night was now absolute," charging the final act. The cost is legible but subtle, more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loop breaks, Unit 734 stands alone with a single perfect note from a forgotten song, and the cost is the shattering of 8,191 prior timelines plus the risk of system failure. Orientation anchors clearly (frozen courtyard, Unit 734, loop 8,192, twilight routine). The causal lens holds: each prior loop's data accumulation enables the final interface attempt, the violin functions as temporal node, and the connection choice directly causes the timeline fold and breakthrough. One meaningful tightening occurs when Unit 734 shifts strategy from ignoring/shattering to interfacing, narrowing options to a single high-risk play. The conceptual cost—millennia of loops sacrificed for one authentic memory fragment—is legible in "It stood alone in the quiet dark, the snow undisturbed at its feet."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: Elias recognizes the cenotaph doodle, leaves his post, witnesses Lena's ritual, and offers the lens as confession. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (micro thaw, silent mutual recognition) with emotional cost legible in "the first delicate thaw" and Lena's tear. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative accent (recurring doodles), held to closure. One persistent weakness: the "accident" remains an unexplained anchor that asks for context the text never delivers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page with felt cost: Elias cracks the pristine marble, converting victory into a monument of resilience—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights his method and the story's premise. The causal lens holds cleanly: fungal-rot backstory → secret treatment → marble collection logic → butterfly arrival (accumulative proof) → deliberate crack (renunciation of perfection). Orientation is swift (name, garden, luck score by line three). One meaningful tightening occurs when the butterflies choose his section, narrowing the manager's dismissal and validating his approach. The cost is visible: he damages the one flawless marble, aligning his monument with his cracked collection.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift and clear (sky mechanic, research station, violet gas giant). The causal chain is clean: Aris needs steady hands → Elias pulls lever → hologram shifts → both men grasp the implication. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's understanding is "irrevocably re-calibrated," the device worked, and the cost is conceptual—his sense of singular selfhood is dissolved into "multitudes." The inferred lens is Causal with Conceptual Repricing overlay at the end, and it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the water-damage pattern intensifies until Elias actively submerges the program, creating a decisive moment where the melody emerges complete. Closure lands on the page with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the "wordless conversation" ends, ghost at peace, Elias gains his song—and the cost (destruction of the artifact to gain the music) is legible. Orientation anchors quickly (Elias, flooded hall, present action). One meaningful deepening (passive observation → active disruption) suffices for this length, and the lens holds through the ending without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara recognizes the smudge as her own need to preserve ambiguity, reweighting her grief without collapsing it. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered perception, the smudge mystery deepens, and the final cadence shift (placing the illustration in auroral light) charges prior material. Cost is felt: she must live in perpetual uncertainty. Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/when by first paragraph). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: abandoned tunnel, late-night radio, confession spoken. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): turning the valve quiets the ghosts and lets the protagonist measure his own burden with visible cost (bone-deep exhaustion, the weight still present but now bearable). Causal lens dominates: confession → tunnel exploration → radio parallels → spectral accusation → valve intervention → peace and self-knowledge. One meaningful tightening when the factory shift "focuses directly on me" narrows options and raises the stakes decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the "drift of untold seasons" offers temporal atmosphere without creating clock pressure. The piece moves through two spatial shards (library → obsidian refuge) with a clear magical transition. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—the keeper accepts the cyclical pattern of saturation and renewal, acknowledging "the peace would crumble again"—with felt cost in the acceptance of impermanence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the saturation of Aeridor's chronicle forces the burrowing action. Cost is legible but muted; the keeper suspends rather than forecloses their duty, which limits closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the eclipse sequence, kalimba melody, and Lena's physical handling of the curl, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (her grip shifts from desperate to tender, reweighting loss as proof of love). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: she still holds the curl but her relationship to it has transformed. One weakness: the final paragraph tells us Elias "had not healed her, not truly" and explains the thematic work rather than trusting the image of her changed grip and smile to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kaelen's discovery deepens in density from initial clue (tapestry) through diaries to the final union of "diagnosis with the ghost." Orientation is anchored early (silo library, Kaelen, his vocation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he completes his quest but accepts he is "only a historian, an archivist of the ache," foreclosing the path of restoration with felt cost. The final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure is a departure framed as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—we're told his "watch ends" without visible forfeiture of specific stakes or relationships. The piece coheres under a Situational lens (he orchestrates from a distance), yet the exchange itself happens off-stage and is observed through binoculars, displacing agency. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, evening, Elias) arrive early and hold. One meaningful tightening occurs (the exchange night), but the protagonist's role is passive observation rather than a decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page: the entity retreats when its monochrome axiom is refuted by recursive questioning, and Elara's gasp marks a decisive change with visible cost (the palette drops, the gray becomes "just a color"). The causal lens holds—each rhetorical probe narrows the entity's logical ground until it collapses. Orientation is swift (who, where, what by the second sentence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the looped "truth" becomes discordant and the entity stammers. Cost is legible: the entity's retreat and Elara's hoarse exhaustion are on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: glass spire, frozen lake, Kaelen at work. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure accretes through mapped memories and the mirrored-horizon spectacle—and the closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kaelen does not conquer time but learns its music and can finally rest, a renunciation with felt cost (exhaustion claimed him, homesickness shifts tune). Cost is legible in "his last reserve of strength" and the transition from painful longing to foundational acceptance. One friction: the cryptic phrase "The beginning is an echo of the end's desire" and the final fortune slip feel like thematic capstones rather than causal turns that narrow options; the spectacle happens on schedule regardless of his work's completion, reducing agency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Hybrid lens (Causal at closure: accepting the memory stabilizes the viaduct; Accumulative texture: the loop structure reweights hope). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure—touching down with solidity, dissolving fractured selves—lands on the page with felt cost (loss of buoyancy, inertness of the tablet). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael shifts from treating the tablet as map to codex, narrowing his approach. The cost is legible in the final image: he becomes "whole again" by surrendering his defining gift, though the price could be sharper if the story dramatized what gravity-defying protected him from.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (deaf music teacher, limestone cavern, autumn). The accumulative lens is taught early through the filament-of-hush concept and held through the performance sequence to a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored hush shifts from absence to presence, reweighting the opening stake with felt cost (months of lonely work, the broken needle as relic). One meaningful deepening occurs when the vibrations "describe not happiness or sadness, but the aching, beautiful space between them." Cost is legible in the final image of tracing the broken needle after months of pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Elias, courtyard, dusk, after being followed. The drive lens reads Causal: pigeon → coordinates → lateral-route realization narrows options from "confront or report" to "intuit via subterranean access." Closure is Charged Poise—Elias pockets the parchment and gathers tools, crystallizing his stance with cost (entering danger, forsaking safety). The cost is visible in "the storm-that-wasn't beckoning him into the dark," though one more sentence showing a specific forfeiture (e.g., delaying a report, discarding an alternate plan) would cement high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements—pattern observation accretes until the confrontation crystallizes a stance. Orientation anchors clearly (grotto, starlight, post-Lumin world) by the second paragraph. The closure is a Charged Poise moment: Elias names the hidden third path ("stand in the doorway") and the shimmer softens in affirmation, reconfiguring the binary into continuous awareness. Cost is conceptual and felt—he forgoes both merger and tidied efficiency to remain threshold-bound—but the final image ("alone with his discovery") makes the trade-off legible if not viscerally dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when he pivots from observing pattern to naming its true nature.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds density through layered sonic images (condensation, violin note, harmonic shimmer, drop in bowl) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the hush gains voice. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—water drop as symphony—lands with conceptual cost (acceptance of diminishment, beauty found in fragments rather than restoration). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes she's playing the wreckage itself, shifting from solitary musician to conductor of ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: Kael will "decant the joy, leaving the sorrow behind as a residue in his own soul, the price of his craft." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory immersion and the final image reweights the premise (half-truths are beautiful lies with hidden costs). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The causal chain from preparation → sensory transfer → separation is motivated and clean, though the escalation is primarily textural deepening rather than plot reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative traces (the correspondence → meeting → grant reveal). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change (Alina receives validation, the cycle completes) but the cost is externalized—Elias feels "cautious exuberance bloom," yet no foreclosed path or visible price appears on the page for him. The grant functions as a solution imported from off-stage research, weakening the because/therefore chain at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kaelen's isolation deepens through the orchard's crystalline permanence, then shifts via the shared search and his protective mats. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~100 words). The closure—polishing cloth as invitation—reconfigures his stance from outsider to insider, and the final image ("two halves of his world become one") reweights the opening contrast between transient reeds and unyielding obsidian. Cost is felt but oblique: he must redirect his art from solitary sculpture to communal service, a trade legible in "not just to his own art, but to the preservation of theirs."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Elias, Grand Canal, stone walkway, the sleeping giant's chest by ~60 words. The causal lens holds: broken cadence → Chronovore nests → arrhythmia → imminent waking → pendant resonance → corrective beat → restoration. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the nest crumbles, the Chronovore dissolves, the rhythm restores, the giant sleeps—options are foreclosed (the creature's work undone) and the city's survival secured. The cost is legible in the dissolution and dust, though the price to Elias personally is oblique (he does not lose the pendant or forfeit a goal). One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the pendant is a tuning fork and acts.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ritual gathers grief's geometry through the glass eyes and mosaic, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elian accepts the loss's new structure with visible peace, foreclosing the search for erasure. Cost is on-page: "The loss was not gone" and "peace that was not happiness" mark the trade. One meaningful deepening (the light-lattice visualization) reweights the dominant stake. Pressure coheres through the single ritual beat without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (library, dawn, power outage, Elias). The causal chain is legible: outage wipes archives → Elias finds fragment → he places it for Anya → she discovers it with hope. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias achieves his purpose of being "found," not seen), and the cost is present but muted—he retreats into shadow, his work complete. The ending crystallizes his liminal existence with visible satisfaction, meeting the RR bar under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias shifts from forced repair to clearing wreckage, a tactical and philosophical pivot that forecloses the preservation path. The accumulative lens holds cleanly—imagery and reflection build pressure through the storm's damage, the perfect leaf, and the questing tendrils. The orientation test is satisfied early (greenhouse, storm season, nursery owner) and causality flows through because/therefore links (storm breaks trellis → repair fails → vine's survival strategy → decision to clear). One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf's perfection reweights the dominant stake from restoration to adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias gains narrative meaning but returns to insomnia, now "less a predator and more a quiet companion"—the cost is visible in his continued sleeplessness but reweighted by the grain/chaff metaphor paying off. The causal chain is clean: storm → trails → convergence → woman → exchange → portrait shift. Single continuous scene with one motivated transition (return journey). Drive lens reads Causal with minor Accumulative texture; the exchange narrows his artistic approach with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lyra releases her grip on a misunderstood purpose, her clairvoyance replaced by "simple, profound sight." The cost is legible—her gift and her role vanish on the page. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the cave's erratic behavior, shadow tableaux, and final note build density toward a cadence shift that reweights Lyra's stake. Orientation anchors quickly (guardian, cave, pilgrim arrival). One meaningful deepening occurs when overlapping shadows restore her sight but show present truth, not future.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (who, where, after-exile timeframe). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the valve arrival mid-story reweights the collection's meaning, and the woman's testimony at the end crystallizes the archive's social function. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the woman's shift from despair to resolve, with visible cost (the lost husband, the broken trumpet sequence). The "staggered intervals" structure teaches the pattern early and pays off when the valve connects to testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric elements. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias accepts the role of keeper—but the cost is declared ("responsibility") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. The mentor's fate is revealed via constellation exposition, which tells rather than shows the price of guardianship, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias perceives his grandmother's memories and shifts from skepticism to acceptance, creating a memorial space with felt cost (loss of certainty, exposure to grief). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—whale song patterns, star charts, and the tile converge through density increase until the storm beat forces the synthesis. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm clarifies the acoustic pattern, tightening options and changing knowledge; the closure reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, what by ~80 words). The causal lens holds: Xylos provokes the spatial mutiny, manipulates magnetic fields, the amulet resists, he masters it, then crosses. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (leaving the sanctuary, embracing the unknown). One meaningful tightening occurs when the amulet's resistance is overcome. The cost is legible in the final image of abandonment, though the actual crossing itself happens off-stage in the final beat, slightly softening the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing—the brachistochrone diagram reweights the fair-trade mathematics with undeniable conceptual cost (the risk taken, the week of uncertainty). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Elara, prep room, tonight). One meaningful tightening: the casket loading forecloses all options and shifts from preparation to consequence. The "week later" ellipsis is motivated and the cost—living with "the cold, hard math of her gamble"—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: dawn ritual → charting the hum → capturing the waveform → workshop completion. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara's continued work against the void with visible cost (the "immense and growing quiet," her isolation). The cost is legible in "Her work was a testament against the void, a single, beautifully crafted page holding back the dark." Orientation is clean by paragraph two (mountaintop, bonsai labyrinth, three years of silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sun rises and she captures the specific texture, reweighting her project from abstract to concrete success.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by paragraph two (death certificate, port city, container). The accumulative lens is taught early—layering overheard fragments—and held to closure, where the ship's horn shatters the composite memory and returns the narrator to solitude. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) is legible: the narrator accepts the cycle ("I will wait for the next tide…a kind of living"), foreclosing direct recovery of the past with a felt cost (isolation, perpetual repetition). One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman's grief and the longshoreman's wonder coalesce around the label, briefly giving it "phantom history." Cost is visible in the return to "silence and the quiet slap of water." Minor ambiguity in how the "layering" mechanically works prevents higher scores, but the closure effect and lens adherence are sound.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative reinforcement. Orientation anchors clearly by line ~40 (abandoned observatory, Elias, workbench, seashell). The experiment sequence tightens causally: bow → hum → frequency lock → dust-mote compass → realization that Thorne marked a terrestrial scar. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elias decodes the first line of the riddle, confirms the invisible scar exists, and accepts the immense lifelong task—options narrow with felt cost. One reversal (the compass points to empty floor, then the insight reweights everything) suffices at this length. Cost is legible: he has "forsaken grant proposals and television appearances" and now commits to solitary, unprovable work.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Kael, Revel, pre-Consortium window). The causal lens holds: Kael's orderly intuition → graffiti-as-ledger plan → Zola's agreement → reorganization → inspector's confusion → story changed. One meaningful tightening (inspector's arrival weeks early) narrows the window and the closure lands with a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: "he had changed the story they would be told...a desperate hope painted bright against the coming tide." The cost is oblique—survival purchased by accepting change "on its own terms"—but the reconfiguration of the Revel's legibility is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—lands on the page: Kaelen documents the extinction, honors the legacy, and carries the "beautiful ache" forward, foreclosing the path of ignorance with conceptual cost. However, the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward the bloom moment), and the tightening is more atmospheric than causal; no mid-story reversal narrows his options, only elapsed time does. The cost is felt but quiet, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening. The closure lands on-page: the repair succeeds, the drone hums perfectly, and the ship lifts anchor—a Decisive Change with felt cost (time pressure, the risk of failure). Causality holds: damaged drone → vibrational diagnosis → targeted repair → success. One meaningful tightening occurs through the escalating horn blasts that narrow her window. Cost is legible in the final image of her sinking onto the stool, drained but successful.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when) in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through layered details (mentor's clue, failed technology, falcon's return, atmospheric conditions) that converge on the frost-map revelation, which serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's identity as "atlas editor" is reweighted to "sole archivist" with the conceptual cost visible in "His life's work as a man who charted static places was a joke told by the universe." The closure reframes the premise with undeniable pressure, though the final moment of witnessing remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias's footsteps layer progressively, building density until the final hum "settled into the ground" signals a tightening. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the "promise of return" reconfigures the town's silence with potential—but the cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph, and the single-scene structure holds, but the ending's reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure or forfeiture that would elevate it beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is swift (submersible, temple, mission) and the causal lens holds: distress signal enables descent → vial capture → psychic overwhelm → focused selection → sealed vial with power loss. The closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise—he achieves the capture but dies, forecloses survival with visible cost (flatlined power, dying breath). One constraint (oxygen countdown) persistently shapes tactics. Minor slip: the mechanism by which he "pulls" a thread from the chaos leans slightly abstract at the peak beat, but the cost and closure image remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. The story builds through sensory density and recursive imagery (copper light, hush, suspended moment) toward a conceptual repricing: the protagonist witnesses an impossible preserved instant, breaks it, and accepts permanent disbelief—cost is legible in the final lines ("they will hear only the echoes of my father's fictions"). Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse, third floor, confessional screen). One meaningful deepening occurs when he breaches the door and lets gravity reclaim the bodies, reweighting his quest for truth with the knowledge that his testimony will never be believed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (transference complete, debt paid, work beginning) with conceptual cost legible in Lyra's dissolution and Elian's solitude, though the felt emotional price remains somewhat muted. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ghost bride's cameos intensify, the flowers deepen, memories accrete, leading to the Night Phalaenopsis bloom as a pattern-break/cadence shift that reweights the stake. One meaningful deepening (bead → memories → full recognition) is present, meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the escalation relies on told intensification ("grew bolder," "built towards a crescendo") rather than dramatized pressure points that narrow Elian's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and maintains it through the ending. Orientation anchors appear promptly (who, where, when by ~80 words). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the threads hold after the storm, the labyrinth transforms from tomb to cradle—with felt cost visible in Kaelen's bleeding hands and the community's newfound reverence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm forces conscious intervention, deepening the stakes from dream-art to survival-of-hope. The cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a conceptual repricing at closure. The piece teaches its method early—purposeful wandering before excavation—and the sundial/ship discovery reweights the interrupted-journey premise with undeniable conceptual cost (her great-grandmother's journey was eternally beginning, not ended). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the carving flips her understanding, and the cost (accepting questions over answers) is legible on the page. No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Gilded Gryphon, dawn, Kaelen's role). Closure reads as Charged Poise: the letter held, ready to send, crystallizes the operation's fragile trust in analog margins with the cost felt in "slow, uncertain journey" and the breath-held timeframe. One meaningful deepening occurs when he moves from digital schematics to physical chalk to the final envelope, each layer reweighting the dominant stake (creating a pathway for an unseen recipient). Cost is legible but oblique—felt as vulnerability rather than paid on the page—which limits high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Elara observes discordant details, synthesizes them into a conspiracy map encoded in embroidery, then exploits the telescope calibration window to transmit the warning. Orientation anchors (observatory, Elara, autumn, pre-coup timeframe) arrive within the first 100 words. The dominant lens reads as Causal with purposeful compression during the data-transmission sequence. Closure is a Decisive Change—the message sent alters the strategic situation and forecloses her safety—but the cost remains somewhat implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. One tightening (recognizing the coup plot) and one escalation (the narrow transmission window) provide adequate pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Elara, mangrove stilt-hut, "tonight"). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael gains "shattering understanding" and Elara angles the shard toward the rising moon, reweighting her depletion and his regret with felt cost. The tightening is modest—spirits swell, words appear, memory surfaces—but the final image reconfigures both characters' stances with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: Elara "hollowing her out," Kael's silent weeping, the apology's silence "filled with a painful, luminous truth."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (atrium, twilight, post-anesthetic window). The closure unit is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the General's throat-swallow and hand-touch crystallize the shared vulnerability Elias translated, foreclosing command-only tactics with felt cost. Drive lens reads Causal: the decryption sequence narrows options and changes the General's stance. One meaningful tightening—child's code to father's heart—lands with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean by ~80 words (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the challenge of coaxing fragile memory into light, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) when the mural locks into place and the protagonist accepts bittersweet remembrance as closure. Cost is legible: the vision dissolves, joy is fleeting, and the protagonist stands alone with only the echo. One meaningful deepening—fragment as anchor—tightens the stakes and enables the closure image. The daydream frame is taught early and paid off at the end without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The nested-awakening structure is taught early and maintained; each iteration reweights the garden's meaning through the evolving hobo nickel imagery. Orientation anchors cleanly (scaffold/cathedral/apprentice) before the shift. The closure unit—Elias returning with the mirror-nickel and choosing uncertainty—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (foregoing predictable craft for learned multiplicity). One meaningful deepening occurs as curiosity overtakes the desire to return. Slight penalty for the "lifetime of awakenings" tell in the penultimate paragraph, which dilutes immediacy at a pivotal transition.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (garden, Kaelen, Synaptic Census context). The wilting sunflower → greenhouse → orchid activation sequence links causally, and the final silence delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the temporary victory crystallizes the stakes with felt cost). However, the gourd-seed's splice with "parasitic chronophage fungus" and its mechanics arrive late without setup, weakening causal motivation. The cost is legible—sirens stutter, network buckles—but the plan's sudden emergence and Kaelen's certainty bypass struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring imagery (postcard, shell acoustics, pain-into-verse alchemy) that culminates in the "blossom armistice" and the postcard's final enshrinement. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara endures wakefulness but reweights its meaning with visible cost (no longer hiding poems, accepting vigil over longing). Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what she does). One meaningful deepening occurs when "the pain did not lessen, but its texture shifted," altering her stance and the sound her home emits. The cost is legible in the final image: her vigil persists, but its nature has changed, and sailors now feel "peace" instead of pure loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and establishes a clear accumulative lens: Elian performs a preservation ritual that culminates in lighting the orchid. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Earned Stasis)—he completes the task and returns to patrol—but the cost remains abstract ("another piece of the world below lost forever") rather than a specific on-page forfeiture or realization that changes his options or stance. The causal linkage (hum → perfect note → light) functions cleanly, but the final image repeats the opening posture without reweighting it through a decisive choice or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara reaches for Kaelen's hand, not the magic, crystallizing trust restored through his visible vulnerability and sacrifice. Cost is legible—empty vial, blood mixed in ink, the binding vow structure that could "shatter the caster." The causal lens holds: his study → ink preparation → inscription → manifestation → her response. Orientation anchors early (archive, moonlight, vellum) and the single-scene frame remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glyph loop closes and "nothing happened...then" the light manifests, narrowing Elara's options to witness or reject.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, task). The drive lens reads Causal: envelope clue → chain cipher → hidden letters → realization that his father's coldness was protective love. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kaelen reweights duty versus love—with felt cost (the years of misunderstanding). The final image ("two parts of the same complex, vital machine") lands the reconfiguration clearly, though the cost is more retrospective ache than on-page foreclosure of a live path. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chain's etchings unlock the coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (attic, Elias, dust ritual). The storm provides a tightening that forces Elias to save the music with Anna's help, and the final scroll image reconfigures his isolation into tentative connection. Cost is felt—he reveals Lena's memory and shares the meteorite's truth—but the closure unit (handing Anna the scroll with the phrase) lacks the decisive pressure of the musical fragments he had been preserving; the swap from music to written phrase dilutes the cumulative charge. One meaningful deepening is present but the final image does not fully reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is swift (prism terrace, Elian, post-butterfly-effect world by ~80 words). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grain analysis → logbook symbol match → threshold prediction → passage, with each beat reweighting his understanding and narrowing options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he kneels at the new chair, still analyzing grain, accepting permanent distance as the cost—"he had chosen the terms of his distance." The cost is legible and felt. One micro turn (discovering the spiral is a code) sets up the final passage without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through station groans, flickering conduits, and the countdown to sunrise, culminating in the light-jellies' arrival that reweights Kaelen's isolation with shared wonder. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the burnt feather's grief "smoothed," belonging redefined) with visible emotional cost—release of a past he can't inhabit. The causal link between energy mapping and jellyfish migration is softly ingenious and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage: Kael examines the glass → reads emotional echoes → uses seeds to map the journey → realizes the gap is not interruption but destination. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure—understanding that the traveler became the crater glass—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the reweighting of "disappeared" to "transformed"), though the felt price to Kael remains thin. One meaningful deepening occurs when pressing the glass to the dead-end completes the map, narrowing options and delivering the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens is Causal with accumulative texture: Kael's channel → water pooling → vibration → coin cascade → light reflection lands as a motivated chain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the couple stops arguing, mural illuminated), but cost remains oblique—no visible forfeiture or decision that narrows Kael's future options on the page. Orientation anchors early (tidal arcade, post-show, Kael alone). The chain holds; the felt price is light.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the dance attempt, the shift to internal gaps, and the anchoring moment that triggers the verse's manifestation—one meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the exile becomes integration; the dance shifts from remembering to being) with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The cost—permanent marking, irrevocable transformation—is present but more asserted than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the pond-ripple pattern reweight Silas's stance toward transience. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he renounces preservation with conceptual cost legible in "carrying its principle, not its form." Orientation anchors cleanly. One meaningful deepening occurs at the pond, narrowing his options. The cost is felt but oblique; pointing to a sharper on-page sentence of loss would strengthen the band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: moonlit ridge, two firefighters, meteor shower. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the layered backstory and converges in Kaelen's realization and gesture. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final image of Kaelen tracing the crack mirrors Elias's touch and reweights "bargained innocence" as a shared map rather than isolated trauma. Cost is conceptual—the naive belief in wholeness is explicitly traded. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kaelen grasps the phrase and its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story orients cleanly (grotto, gauge, Elara's purpose by the second paragraph) and follows a causal Accumulative/Textural hybrid: pattern creation → tide catalyst → gauge response. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the needle settles higher, a verified positive result that reweights the timeline's vitality with conceptual cost (the equation is "spent"). The dip-then-climb is a micro turn that sets up the resolution, and the final image reconfigures her stance from experiment to next iteration. Cost is conceptual and operational (materials consumed, pattern dissolved) rather than deeply felt, which keeps the closure effect legible but somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara records the burden without claiming it, renouncing intervention with visible cost—she leaves evidence that could reshape historical understanding. The accumulative layering (corridor hum → journals → negative → final notation) builds density and the cadence shift at "leaving the ghosts to their ivy-veiled passage" reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening is present and cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered sensory detail and parallel city vignettes toward a reconfiguration where planted seeds linger as ghosted possibility. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (terrace, figure, spring shower). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final bell breaks the spell, reflections return to normal, but the "ghost of a possibility" remains—a reweighting with conceptual cost (ephemeral art, no guarantee of change). One meaningful deepening occurs when the light infuses with pulse and finds its city targets. Cost is legible but oblique; the borrowed heartbeat recedes, leaving only his own, which implies expenditure without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear situational-leaning-accumulative lens: Elias uses ritual weight and celestial timing to pressure two enemies toward signing. Orientation is clean by paragraph one (who/where/when). The closure—two signatures under the dual moons—lands on the page with visible cost (Vorlag's "profound surrender," the "fragile" treaty). The escalation tightens once when Elias adds the dust sigil after sensing the moment "fraying," which narrows the generals' options and shifts Kaelen to act. One meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in "the long, difficult work" ahead and Vorlag's crumbling.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias commits the egg to dissolution, foreclosing any resurrection path, and the cost is unmistakable on the page—"An entire lineage, a whole library of song, was unwritten." The causal lens holds: his fortune and drought projects led him here, the map guided him, and the basin's properties enable the biochemical gesture. The "quiet, hollow resonance" and the promise of rain-as-curse complete the reconfiguration with felt weight. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (salt flat, rig, basin) by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the prism's silent wave and Elara's smile crystallize the rebellion's launch with conceptual cost legible in the returned truths. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the courtyard → prism → rite sequence, culminating in a cadence shift from tension to serene release. However, the rite itself compresses a decade's knots into one paragraph with elliptical mechanics ("mimed the final pull"), leaning on assertion over demonstrated causality; the cost is conceptual (the powerful now carry their truths) but lacks a visible, felt price paid by Elara on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Kaelen in the radar dome, post-argument, holding the story stick. The causal lens holds throughout—Elara's accusation triggers doubt, doubt prompts memory of the hollow-eyed man, memory crystallizes the decision to answer rather than abandon his method. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he commits to a new show that complicates rather than retracts, reweighting his artistic stance without abandoning his core belief. Cost is present but somewhat implied—the baton metaphor and "point toward the dawn" soften what could be a sharper sacrifice or foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece orients quickly (grotto, Elias, today's migration) and delivers a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration: the structures serve their purpose, the butterflies pass through, and the quiet afterward signals fulfillment. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through weaving, monarchs arriving, final spire completion—culminating in the last butterfly's passage and the return to stillness. Cost is conceptual (the cadence has ended "for good") but legible in the final image. No causality breaks; the escalation is modest but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (glacial sanctum, post-forgiveness timeframe, Elian's preservation mission) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through detailed craft work toward a final luminous sigil that reweights the forgotten name with light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sigil projected, then sketched for casting)—yet the felt cost is muted; Elian ends "heart full" with no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The reconfiguration deepens his archive mission but does not visibly narrow options or exact a price on the page, keeping it shy of high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the fractured-sight premise accumulates pressure through memory/premonition layering until the seal-consumption crystallizes Kael into the present. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (he becomes present for the first time) with visible cost (bunker collapse, his death implied). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The causality of "only desperate starvation forces him to eat the key" is elegant and the final image—rain on his face, feeling it for the first time—charges prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with closure via Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—the star-cloud blooms on the page, the covenant is sealed through shared secret, and Kavi's voluntary dismantling forecloses the path of public acclaim with felt cost. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~50 words (Kavi, ziggurat, Babylonian interregnum). The sequence moves from preparation through ritual to revelation and dismantling with coherent pressure and a single meaningful tightening when the star-cloud appears. Cost is legible in the final act: he "swept…back into its clay pot…leaving no trace," preserving the treasure "in the vault of his quiet, devoted mind" while "the new king could have the city."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—cellular memories build toward Vale's choice. Closure lands (Vale accepts grace) with some cost (reality stabilizes), but the turn hinges on Elara's intervention rather than Vale's prior struggle; the catalyst object materializes conveniently at the critical point without prior grounding. Orientation is clear early (who, where, why). One meaningful deepening occurs (the breaking memory replayed with context), but the resolution arrives via external tool rather than protagonist agency, weakening causal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara proves the boundary erasable with visible cost (the vision crumbles) and transforms her stance from retrieval to mastery of the method. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through breath, frost, and the sextant's symbolic weight, then the pattern breaks at the fracture and reconfigures in her final gesture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by paragraph two. One tightening: the breathingMethod narrows her focus and the frost responds, raising the stakes from abstract longing to tangible creation and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric accent. Elian's rediscovery of the ribbon and seed narrows options (abandon old tools, plant the seed), and the closing choice forecloses the path of imposing mending while opening reconciliation with Lyra. Orientation anchors cleanly (cathedral rafters, orchard, commission termination) by the second paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the ribbon left as "a small blue prayer" crystallizes future reconciliation with felt cost (letting go of control, leaving the token behind). One meaningful tightening through protagonist agency under the causal lens with cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Kaelen, astral orchard, asteroid curator. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers paradoxes and images until the bathroom breakthrough reweights the cameo's emptiness and Kaelen's role, achieving a Conceptual Repricing. The cost is conceptual—he now understands his position as conduit in a temporal loop—and the final image of returning to the orchard with "terrible clarity" reconfigures his earlier disquiet. One minor slip: the breakthrough itself is more told than causally built through prior micro-discoveries, slightly softening the closure's felt inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: Kael's warning → need for Library → research gaps → botanical diary → map → wall → Curators → access granted. Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands at the precipice with access granted, options crystallized, cost implied in "weight of all possible futures" and the long negotiation risked. The cost is felt rather than decisively paid on the page, which fits RR but limits the charge. One meaningful tightening (catalog research → confrontation) is present under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the ship setting and Elara's identity are legible early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the swatch card recurs with escalating intensity, each memory-touch deepening pressure until the womb revelation reweights the entire quest. Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing—the Garden is reframed from a place to find into a memorial to build—with visible cost (the "blissful aberration" is lost, replaced by "clean, cold loneliness"). One deduction: the mechanics of memory-recapture are asserted rather than demonstrated causally; we are told each swatch surfaces a memory, but the because/therefore linkage between card and memory remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: door appears → Elias researches → finds rope → weaves it into gears → door stabilizes. Orientation is clear early (archivist, clock tower, thirteenth chime). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (integration of the anomaly into stable reality) with conceptual cost visible in the final image—he catalogues what was absent. The drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture; the ending lands cleanly under this hybrid. One meaningful tightening (the weaving) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen achieves the bloom of hush, ending the alien noise and restoring harmonic peace. The lens is Causal—each step (ice extraction, pattern internalization, transference to stone) narrows options and raises cost, culminating in the violent flare and inversion. The cost is visible: physical endurance, the shuddering cave, and the phrase "hard-won quiet" signals toll. Orientation anchors are clear by ~80 words (Kaelen, caves, pedestal, stone). One escalation beat (the terrifying flare before success) provides meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens: Elian's star-tracking work creates the conditions for the beacon's rekindling, with because/therefore linkage from vision to calculation to assembly. Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (custodian, Spire, post-collapse world, broken prism). The closure—beacon pulsing lavender light—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (his generational loneliness, the terror of doubt, the fragility of the achievement). One pressure point: the alignment itself arrives as coincidental cosmic timing rather than being forced by Elian's agency, which slightly softens the causal tightness at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Kael, observatory dome, post-storm moment). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: shadow-measurement conjecture leads to glyph discovery, which triggers the console action and memory flood. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael reweights the fog from prison to monument and shifts his archival purpose from recovery to honoring choice—with conceptual cost legible in the line "to understand the reasons for what wasn't." One meaningful tightening (frantic measurement → alignment → memory reveal) is sufficient for this length. The causal chain holds, though the memory's arrival feels slightly convenient (the storm provides the alignment) rather than fully protagonist-driven at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory accretion, ritual chanting, and the fortress speaking in layered detail until the knot teaches a pattern-recognition method that reweights the wall into a schematic. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the hush shifts from enemy to canvas, altering Kael's stance with conceptual cost (acceptance of broken pieces as material, not obstacle). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the knot clarifies method and the wall reveals the blueprint, deepening his understanding with felt cost (months of silence, the weight of hopelessness carried). The cost is legible but oblique—more conceptual shift than visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's realization reweights their bond from "sharp-edged proximity" to "something diffuse and enduring," with the cost legible in her acceptance of his departure. The accumulative/textural lens holds—sensory detail and reflection build density until the cicada metaphor crystallizes meaning. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early (tidal pools, cicada life cycle) and pays it off cleanly. Slight gap: the cost is more felt than visible; we don't see a concrete path foreclosed, only emotional recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page with felt cost: Elian carries the trellis's silence back, which reweights his confinement without erasing it ("the panic did not come"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building pressure through contrasting silences. Setup is clean by ~80 words ("when gravity inverts"). One meaningful deepening occurs when he collects the trellis silence and it becomes a "shield...of perspective," altering his relationship to the bunker's gilded hush. The cost is visible: he must return to walls that "felt low," accepting partial relief rather than escape.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Elian, gondola, Aether, prism terraces. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory instruction until the woman's breathing and voice modulate. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's state shift) with conceptual cost legible in Elian's solitary return and the cycle's continuity. One meaningful tightening occurs when she unclenches and her voice becomes "part of the quiet." The lens holds cleanly and the final image reweights Elian's purpose without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal track: deadline pressure → sonic unlock → peel layers → insert flake → throne filled. Closure lands on-page with a conceptual repricing: the throne never needed a body, only its heart/key. The cost is implicit—Elara walks away without rule or recognition—but the image is resonant. Orientation is swift (who, where, stakes by ~80 words). One meaningful tightening occurs (dawn approaching, final insertion). The lens is causal-accumulative hybrid; the ending pivots on discovery, not character transformation, which slightly softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (ashen sanctuary), and when (six months post-contact) by the opening lines. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens—situational pressure (Elara's deliberate ritual encroachment) converging with accumulative texture (starlight, ash, the doorknocker ring)—that resolves in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liam's first breath and the threshold becoming a conduit. The cost is legible in Elara's six-month isolation and the "loaded emptiness" now "punctuated by a tiny, impossibly resilient pulse." The two-POV structure with a clear section break and the multi-shard movement (Elara's sanctuary → Liam's room → back to Elara) remain coherent under the ending lens. No causality breaks; the scar-link method is set up and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph: Elara in the mushroom farm during the Time of Manifestation. The closure unit is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing overtones—the bolt physically stabilizes the Promise, converting its destructive potential into literal diamonds and relieving the cavern's unbearable pressure. The causal lens holds: the glitchy messages cue the bolt's use, Elara's volunteer move enables access, and her action resolves the threat with visible cost (her years of carrying the bolt's weight, the risk of approaching a "metaphysical bomb"). One tightening deepens from potential chaos to resolved silence with a tangible product (diamonds), satisfying the 600–800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ritual builds pressure through sensory density and standing-wave mechanics, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where Elara reweights her dynasty-ender status with visible emotional cost (the "immense weight" lifting, replaced by "novel lightness"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure effect lands on the page with felt cost, and the lens holds. One minor slip: the flood of understanding feels more told than shown, slightly softening the causality of the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal arc: failing tree → consult program → execute dance → release clasp → world reborn. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, knight, object) arrive early. The closure lands on the page with visible cost (the clasp springs open, energy scours him, the program turns to dust) and the world transforms. One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm crescendos and forces the final gesture. The drive lens reads as Causal with lyric texturing; the because/therefore chain holds and the ending reconfigures the orchard with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph one). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered discovery (dust pattern → fold → button → indentation → message) that reweights Elara's grief into connection across time. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act of transcribing and reuniting object with meaning crystallizes her shift from isolation to participation in a "vast, continuing story," with the conceptual cost visible in her acknowledgment that she is "not healed, but tactfully hopeful." The lens holds without contradiction and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the activation broadcasts fragments of truth, not overthrow, reweighting the premise from lost war to persistent witness with visible cost (her solitary exposure in the glowing booth). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Elara, apartment, Directorate city, 18:43, network silence). Causality holds: network silence → move now → puddle-map → lagoon → key → broadcast. One meaningful deepening occurs when the broadcast itself is revealed as symbolic seeding rather than tactical victory, reconfiguring her stated goal ("hold the line") into an act of visible witness. Cost is legible on the page: she stands alone, exposed by golden light, having activated a system that marks her position. The "crack in the mirror" image charges the closure without requiring a decisive external reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis: Elias restores the vested hush, pushing back the prophecy with visible effort and the cost of solitary preservation. The drive lens reads as Situational—coherent pressure (the coded drips) forces stance crystallization (playing through negative space to frame silence). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without debt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy begins to speak and Elias counters it; the sequence tightens from threat to suppression with clear causality under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with causal elements (sorting→pattern recognition→monument building→prod→transformation). Closure is a Decisive Change: the arbor awakens, green replaces ash, Elian's role transforms—cost is legible as irreversible world-state shift and identity reconfiguration. The "prod" moment functions as catalyst; the piece teaches its pattern (leaf-sorting as decipherment) and pays it off, though the escalation is primarily external wonder rather than internal choice narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Elias, his trade, the season). The accumulative lens—cog trail → greenhouse → compass → cavern—tightens once with the improvised fulcrum choice, and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he witnesses rather than repairs, foreclosing his tinkerer's mission with visible acceptance). Cost is felt in the final paragraph's peace, though the conceptual repricing ("part of the question") edges toward tell. Lens holds; one meaningful deepening present.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening (foundry, dawn, post-search-party). The piece follows a causal lens: Kael's grief drives the alchemical attempt, the ritual's precise execution creates the transformation, and the coin's physical change enables his emotional reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—his energy drained, strength spent—and the transformed coin becomes a tangible vessel for "luminous regret." The cost proof is explicit: "he felt the crushing weight in his chest transmute into something else entirely."

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Silas descends, confronts the spirit's chaotic grief, redirects her toward joyful memory, and witnesses her dissolution as closure. Orientation anchors quickly (Silas at Echo Gorge, sunrise, spiritual midwife). The closure—spirit shifting from distorted harp to luminous dissolution—lands on the page with visible transformation, and the cost is legible in the spirit's decades-long gray twilight now ended. One deduction: the spirit's transformation hinges on Silas's single prompt without a prior failed attempt or mid-scene tightening that narrows options, slightly weakening escalation under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: proprioceptive detail, memory fragments, and the violet forest accumulate until the final beat reweights the premise from punishment to experiment. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the forest becomes crucible, the strap becomes tool—with a felt shift in stance ("purposeful" vs. "desperate"). The cost is oblique but legible: he must remain and solve the question rather than escape.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph; the piece follows a single continuous scene in one location with a clear causal arc (lens → painting → revelation). The drive lens reads Causal: the protagonist's intentional use of the lens unfastens the hidden history, altering the painting's state and bringing closure to the drowned crew. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the history acknowledged, the lens lighter), with felt cost present in "finally, mercifully, come to an end." One meaningful tightening occurs when the deliberate errors signal the keyhole, narrowing options to this canvas. Minor penalty: the "unfastening" mechanic is asserted rather than dramatized with physical or emotional friction, reducing cost legibility at the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Leo completes the task the ghost could not, the spirit dissipates, and the final image—Leo holding the barrel, understanding he has "repaired a crack in the veil"—reweights the opening premise with felt cost (engagement with the spectral world, acceptance of his vocation). Drive lens is Causal with situational elements; the power cut triggers the ghost's full appearance, Leo's observation drives discovery, his choice to engage enables resolution. Orientation is clear by the third sentence. One meaningful tightening occurs when silence crashes down and the ghost resolves, narrowing Leo's options to ignore or engage.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when by ~80 words). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the Operator performs a ritual, pressure builds through environmental response (hum, trembling books, rupture), and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library transforms from static perfection to potential. However, the closure image ("any story could begin") asserts conceptual cost without making it felt on the page—there is no specific forfeiture, no visible price, no dramatized moment where the Operator loses something tangible. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causally linked to protagonist choice, and the "immeasurable instant" dissolves into summary ("everything happened at once") instead of landing as a concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Kaelen, Asteroid Adagio, post-Unraveling). Causal lens dominates: the temporal squall triggers the covering ritual, which isolates the shard, whose glow delivers the vision that reweights Kaelen's thesis and rekindles his resolve. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the shard becomes "the cornerstone of a lost people's dignity," reconfiguring the academic war into an existential resurrection with felt cost ("the old fire, banked but not extinguished"). Cost is conceptual and relational—Valerius will resist, the fight continues—but undeniable in the final image. One minor gap: the mechanics of how the shard "absorbs" visible time rather than reflects it are asserted without prior anchoring in world rules, creating a brief causality hiccup that does not break closure but slightly loosens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/what by the opening paragraphs; the drive lens reads Causal with a situational accent (Elias's conviction → chip blazes → world heals). The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the rust recedes, blue sky returns), and the tether completes the causal chain established early. One meaningful tightening occurs when doubt nearly derails the mechanism, then Elias's renewed humility restores it. The cost is legible in the final image, though the rust-voice's defeat feels swift after the single reversal, limiting escalation depth to one turn rather than compounding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a meaningful cadence shift at closure. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara renounces capture, places the compass, and exits transformed—"her place in it—and its place in her—had been fundamentally, and beautifully, rearranged." Cost is visible (she leaves the vials empty, abandons her profession's method) and the scent-cataloging premise is decisively reweighted. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (cottage, factory bluffs, profession). One causal question: the compass "ignored true north entirely" after the factory closed, yet deeper in "the needle spun uselessly, overwhelmed by the rock's magnetism"—minor inconsistency in its behavior that does not break the hinge-discovery beat but clouds the object's reliability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story employs a clear causal lens: discovery of slide → projection → pattern recognition → replication → survival. Orientation is prompt (sculptor, archway, storm) and the closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (physical labor, soaking, shivering) plus a Conceptual Repricing (world not broken, merely disconnected). The final paragraph's thematic summary ("Her life's work was no longer just about shaping wood") tilts toward tell but the prior image of her standing among driftwood "no longer just forms to be carved, but letters in a language" offers resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wave forces immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens with motivated progression from postcard clue to cathedral discovery to layered revelation. Orientation anchors early (amber pavilion, postcards, winter's end). The closure—understanding her inheritance and the flowers' night-blooming philosophy—lands on the page with conceptual cost (a lifetime question answered, lineage discovered). One persistent weakness: the protagonist's agency is observational rather than decisional; the window reveals itself through patient method rather than through choices that foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a Causal lens: Kaelen's repeated attempts fail until he reframes his question from conflict to aftermath, which earns the coordinate reveal. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—deciphering the coordinate—is a Decisive Change that narrows options with felt cost (weeks of trapped isolation). One minor linkage ambiguity: the transition from "a new thought surfaced" to the debris rearrangement feels slightly telescoped; the reader infers the shift but does not witness the micro-decision that births it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens pressure through iterative acts of memory-based creation, building from zero lights to two, with promise of a thousand more. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Kaelen knows the work will consume his life, the cost is undeniable ("rest of his life," "agonizing"), and the final image reweights the opening emptiness with purposeful creation. The piece avoids a decisive external change but earns its resonance through accumulation and cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with situational pressure: the foghorn's silence → dread → wax recording → prophecy → realization forms a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors (Elian, rooftop garden, post-silence) arrive early. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes Elian's impossible choice (archive vs. survival) with undeniable conceptual cost—his life's work is the lure. The story teaches its stakes by midpoint and the ending reconfigures all prior material without stating a resolution. One meaningful tightening (the prophecy narrows options decisively) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story orients cleanly (who, where, when by the opening paragraph) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vortex's chaos is gathered back into order through iterative image-work. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara reopens the stable core, the atrium firms, and she feels the chorus of lineage. The cost is conceptual (borrowed time's fragility) and relational (the inheritance "seeded for another generation"), legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she extends her consciousness and begins gathering fragments, narrowing the wild dance into quiet cadence. Minor deduction: the central reversal (chaos to order) is enacted through extended metaphor rather than a concrete on-page choice that forecloses a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear causal lens: Elian's months of tracking → discovery of the rope → repair of console → diversion at zero hour. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change with visible cost (he defies protocol, risks his position, chooses listening over institutional mandate). The orientation is clean by the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs through the countdown sequence that narrows options to a binary choice, and the final image reweights "hush" from absence to presence of listening with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates through ritual repetition, then breaks pattern when Kael decides to "feel" rather than just trace, building to a resonant reconfiguration where stillness transforms from emptiness to "resonant peace." Closure is on-page (the final paragraph) with conceptual cost legible in the line "He was still a janitor, a sweeper of dust"—his role is unchanged but reweighted, foreclosing the fantasy of escape. Orientation is clean within 120 words (custodian, tracking station, nebula edge, post-abandonment era). One meaningful deepening occurs when passive observation shifts to active empathy, narrowing his prior detachment and opening vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) at closure. The final beat—closing the lid, silence "quiet again," no longer astonished—reconfigures the dominant stake (preserving unspoken words vs. releasing them) with felt cost: he remains a recluse but the weight is shared. One tightening occurs when Lyra points to the box, narrowing his options from vigil to action. Causality is clean; the honeycomb reveal and ghost dissolution follow logically from the opening premise. Cap at 7.8 due to slight heaviness in the reflectiveMiddle ("He believed that keeping them contained…"), which delays the final move without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through escalating loneliness, the garage sale experiment, and the arrival of the traveler's message. Orientation is anchored early (emerald silo, post-Collapse world, damaged time capsule). Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) when Kael presses the fragment to the wall and receives the memory; the final image reconfigures his relationship to time from "borrowed" to "suddenly timeless." However, the cost is largely told ("gnawing sense... had vanished") rather than enacted through a visible forfeiture or renunciation that narrows future options, and the silo's resonator function arrives late without prior setup, creating a minor causality slip.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: it layers image, sound, and observation toward a final moment of artistic synthesis. Orientation is swift (poet, lagoon, post-rain). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kaelen completes a "woven dawn" by folding the child's loss into a poem about grace in letting go—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique. The feather's inclusion and the final image of parent and child walking away offer cadence shift, yet no on-page price or tactic alteration is legible in the ending beat itself, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Elias completes the connection, the hum begins, and he "closed his eyes, his breathing slowing to match the new, unified rhythm." The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) is legible—he has negotiated his departure and created the symbiosis. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (copper web accumulates, final connection triggers the change). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (island caretaker, temple orchard, terminal diagnosis). One meaningful tightening: the final wire insertion that completes the circuit and transforms the orchard. Cost is felt (his life ends as the system awakens) and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, clearly taught by the structure of gathering sensory detail and converging footprints that culminate in pattern recognition. Orientation anchors cleanly (trailhead, Perihelion Path, post-Contact context) by paragraph one. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Aris's placement of the amber at the nexus is a renunciation of his prior intellectual stance with visible cost ("sacrifice of his cherished skepticism"), and the final image of "bronze quiet...as foundation" reweights the opening skepticism. The accumulative pressure (sculpture, drizzle, tower, spiraling prints, shared stillness) tightens to one decisive moment where the artificiality of the pilgrimage is reframed as intentional human-made convergence, and his gesture forecloses his former identity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (jetty, twilight, dead ocean). The piece accumulates through density of image and ritual action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he has planted a garden on a gravestone, translating submerged concord into a new tongue, with the visible cost of labor and the promise to return tomorrow. The closure reweights the opening premise—stubbornness against loss—through the final image of dark soil patches breaking grey stone. One tightening: the birds' instructions narrow his choices from abstract intent to specific placement and seed selection.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with clear causal linkage: cylinder riddle → decoding → Barrow's scent-tracking → cave discovery. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost (the journey's risk, the grandmother's absence reweighted as promise rather than loss). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the phonograph shift from audio disappointment to groove-writing riddle redefines the quest, and the cave discovery crystallizes the thematic repricing with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines, avoiding orientation debt. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ritual, the gilded compass rose, and the vision accumulate toward a final reweighting of the silence. However, the closure unit—"she was ready to explore"—offers stance declaration without a legible on-page cost or decisive change in her situation. The vision itself is told in summary ("She saw..."), not dramatized, weakening the pivot. One meaningful deepening is present (the vision reweights her perception), but cost remains implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sylas holds the luminescent seed, a conceptual cost/promise visible in the shift from sterile control to "beautiful, terrifying possibility." Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the climb, light show, swap, and charged final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael performs the swap under time pressure. Minor orientation lag: "viridian nebula bled where Polaris should have been" and "fractured obsidian moon" delay spatial grounding by ~80 words, but the effect pays off thematically and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Great Dome, Elara, post-Collapse interregnum) and follows a single continuous scene. Escalation proceeds causally: Elara's paced code prompts the prisoner's tapping, which forces her final grief performance, which cracks the Regent's mask and produces the key-turn. The closure—Regent releasing the prisoner—lands on the page as Decisive Change with visible cost (her composure cracking, the "immense being set free"), though the Regent's reversal from ruthless surgeon to yielding authority occurs in a single beat and could use one more micro-signal of doubt earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara anchors herself to the present through the stone's tactile current, forecloses phantom escape with the visible cost of her nightly worlds, and plants herbs as an on-page act of committed inhabitation. The causal lens holds cleanly—each search beat narrows options (weeks of navigation, stone disappointment, feather memory trigger) until the final method constrains her choice. Orientation anchors (bookstore, mercury-glass seer) land early. Cost is legible: she loses the "kinder" phantom worlds and accepts the painful present.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (wisdom to begin the next game) with visible cost (the aching relief of truce, not triumph). The causal chain—memory → tapestry study → cipher decoding → labyrinth solution → hush unraveling—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when he identifies the frayed border as cipher. Orientation anchors (Elias, fountain, Stillwater, frozen time) arrive within the first ~80 words. Cost is felt: he gains forgiveness but cannot erase the move.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through thematic density and the recursive canyon acoustics, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the echoes shatter into "a universe of contemplation." Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Elara, canyon, Ossuary, ritual imminent). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—Wardens' footsteps closing in—and the lens holds throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when her final poem fractures the monolithic truth, reweighting the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the statue's scars become testament rather than erasure, and Elara exhales the story she held. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each scar filled builds the web of light, culminating in the star-shaped heart crater where love replaces pain. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Elara, bathysphere, acid sea, floating workshop. The final golden pulse and eased breath deliver felt cost (the alchemical breath spent) and stakes reweighted through kintsugi logic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (cave entrance, wrong turn, oasis) and the seashell's recurrence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page: "the weight in his soul felt, for the first time, like his own again" articulates a visible shift with felt cost (the shell is relinquished, the memory placed). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs (wrong turn → hidden oasis → release), sufficient for this length. The cost is legible in the image of the shell drifting down and in the protagonist's altered weight, meeting the Cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (Elias, lighthouse lantern room, predawn). The drive lens is Situational—Elias's stance crystallizes through his focused beckoning, and the Stellaria's approach validates his method with felt cost (his exhaustion, the risk taken). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the captain's testimony and Elias's silent acknowledgment reweight the whisper-versus-shout premise with undeniable pressure. One minor slip: the mechanism (lens as "filter for the heart") is told rather than tested on the page before the climax, slightly weakening causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors early—Elias at the signal station, post-hydraulic failure—and the orientation is clear by the first paragraph. The midnight phone call triggers the placement of the censer foot, which produces the ethereal signal; causality is present and the closure lands with a visible image (the light blooming, tears, the thread for the lost). However, the "maddeningly precise" method via cryptic calls is told in summary across weeks, diluting on-page escalation. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias completes the device, and the final image reweights his grief into a communal beacon. Cost is felt but oblique—he has not brought his daughter back—and the renunciation is implicit rather than foregrounded in a decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (truffle forager, hanging orchard, post-virus world). The story follows a causal lens: desperate search → acquisition → attunement ritual during storm → successful occlusion → neighbor's test of the relic's effect. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Elias gains partial silence but only after trading three kilos of truffles and enduring the storm's turmoil; the glass eye now guards "the first cornerstone of his new, quiet world," signaling a path foreclosed (total honesty) and one opened (curated truth). The because/therefore linkage holds cleanly, and the final beat demonstrates the relic's function with felt relief and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas places the boutonnière among his treasures, accepting his role as witness to solitude rather than escaping it—"feeling the weight of one less ghost in the world, and his own isolation, for a moment, witnessed and shared." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory fragments and gaps build density until the final image reweights the dominant stake (decoding the gesture) with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation is anchored early (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, nautical twilight). The two-shard structure (discovery → investigation across weeks → final understanding) coheres under one lens and one meaningful deepening when the gaps crystallize into meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (ant-tracking builds pressure, the chip unlocks the doorway). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (map dealer, three days, sugar/ants, creek rising). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias lowers the chip, the doorway dissolves, and he walks away with peace—a renunciation that forecloses entry with felt cost (the ache finally unknotted). One meaningful tightening via the rising creek and the chip's warming creates urgency. Cost is legible in the final image: he turns from potential alternate lives toward acceptance. The causal chain holds cleanly from setup through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: the recurring dreams drive the climb, the grotto delivers the promised dissolution, and Elara's renunciation earns the shift from escape to sentinel. Orientation is clean by the first beat. The closure—Earned Stasis with brutal purpose—lands on the page with felt cost: she accepts the gilded cage to guard others. One meaningful tightening (the hypnotic pull vs. Kael's grip) sufficiently narrows options at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the secret, realization, and alchemy attempt, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's method shifts with visible emotional and conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (Ember Nexus, twilight, two characters present). The piece teaches a pattern of failed attempts building to breakthrough; Kael's departure announcement serves as the tightening that forces revaluation. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: abandoning the mathematical ideal to embrace messy presence, charged by the shared glance and tear.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection and memory until the flight-trance breaks the pattern and reweights the stance. Orientation anchors (mountain ranger cabin, charcoal on birch bark, post-grave timeframe) land cleanly in the opening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator moves from jealous fragmentation to integrated authorship) with visible cost—he must live within the "strange and fractured narrative" rather than escape it. The flight memory providing the breakthrough reads as motivated by accumulated nostalgia rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story coheres around density increase—fog to dripping quiet to sunlight—and a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's acceptance of her transformed vocation forecloses the aromatherapist path with visible cost (the "scentless void" she inhabits). Cost is legible in the final image: "clean, empty air" charges her new reality. One minor slippage: the old man's backstory ("retired surgeon") arrives via dialogue convenience rather than through discovery under pressure, creating a small causal seam.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: Elian kneels on the floating platform, afflicted by crystalline scars, attempting a runic cure. Drive lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: weeks of failed scholarly attempts motivate the pivot to folk method, and the shedding constitutes an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost (abandonment of academic keys). The closure is legible and the crystalline structures softening/shedding is shown on the page with visible result. One tightening—the pivot from ink to touch/naming—narrows options and the cost (his logic reaching its limit) is present, though the grandmother memory arrives slightly late as the causal key.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (the ritual's progression creates pressure). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Julian, archive, tonight). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Julian delivers the apology, receives acceptance rather than forgiveness, and the weight in his chest shifts—a decisive internal change with felt cost ("imperfect, a fractured and painful absolution"). The hum ceasing and chainsaws starting frame the cost as finality. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vex flips the switch and the sensory deluge forces Julian's apology into the void.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is adequate: who (the Witness), where (Ancient Temple Library), and when (endless now) are established early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence meant to reweight the dominant stake—but closure relies on told dissolution rather than a concrete image or action that reconfigures options with visible cost. The final act ("she stopped witnessing and simply became") asserts transformation without on-page proof of what was forfeited or altered. No cost-proof sentence in the ending beat meets the test; the claim is made, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding consistently: the piece builds through layered sensory detail, reflective density, and a pattern of glacial/temporal imagery that converges at the ice shard discovery. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): Elias shifts from corrector to witness, foreclosing the repair path with conceptual cost legible in "his duty was not to tame the flock, but to witness." The cost is felt in his decision to preserve the "beautiful flaw." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the discrepancy leads to the ice shard, which reweights the entire measurement premise.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the library frame establishes Aris sorting inheritance after her father's death. The structure is a mosaic of compressed beats (library discovery, weeks of traversal, final balcony revelation) with one substantial ellipsis signaled by "For weeks." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (lighting the lantern charges the father's paradox with acceptance; the cost is her detachment from zero-risk certainty). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered scrawls and the final image reweights the stake. One deduction: the traversal montage compresses causality into summary rather than dramatizing a second distinct turning choice, reducing middle pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean (who, where, when established early). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the glass harmonica note and looped phrases accumulate to reweight the caller's narrative grammar from ending to beginning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the caller's "observing" stance and the "pause" rather than hang-up). Cost is present but oblique—the caller's despair is reframed, not solved, and Silas's isolation persists. One tightening (the semantic loop method) deepens the stake sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph; the drive lens reads as Causal with textural layering. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise): the shared understanding and the jetty's blooms constitute a visible transformation, and the "weight of a hundred years" arriving with "ghosts of generations who had lived and died by a lie" provides felt cost. However, the blooms appearing simultaneously with Tomas's arrival leans on coincidence to deliver the resolution rather than Elara's agency driving the final turn, which slightly weakens the causal chain at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture; Silas's engineered rumor creates the gathering, which forces his decision to abandon the myth and engage directly—a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he accepts that loneliness won't be cured by a single event but by "the slow, patient process of winding a community back to life," forgoing the moon rock reveal with visible cost (the stone "felt heavy, a false promise"). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening: the crowd's arrival and hesitation narrow his options from passive waiting to active facilitation. Cost is legible: he sacrifices the personal myth that sustained him.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kaelen gathers musical notes across days, building a melody that mirrors his emotional journey. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the Stillpoint reweights silence as harmony rather than absence), with visible conceptual cost—he must accept grief's bearable shape rather than erasure. The orientation anchors quickly (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, platinum ring by ~80 words), and the lens holds cleanly through the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final note is found "in the space between things," shifting from tactile absorption to dowsing emptiness, which narrows his approach and delivers the closure reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The causal lens dominates: Kaelen's theorizing about temporal folds enables the signal work, his frantic edits reveal cascading disasters, and his choice to transmit understanding rather than alter data closes with visible renunciation (thousands remain dead, but he accepts the man he became). The cost—permanent loss of redemption—is legible in "He would not be seeking a new ink cartridge." One tightening (discovery → frantic editing → acceptance) lands the Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Elian, luminous harbor, tonight. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through mapped silences until the final chord reweights the harbor's emptiness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the silence now "filled with a quiet, unending song"), and the cost is legible—Elian walks away, his work complete, the forgotten given harmony. One meaningful deepening occurs when he reaches the ferry landing and the silence becomes "active, aggressive," pushing the ritual to its climax. The lens holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors—who (Kaelen, arsonist), where (Xylos Archive), and when (five years post-arson)—land in the opening paragraph. The causal chain is motivated: tapestry fragment → petroglyph trail → sarcophagus mole → pressure-plate chamber → lens-key reveal; each link constrains the next move. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen shifts from destruction to creation, the final image ("hands...reached for a brush") crystallizes intent with felt cost (he foreclosed violence, embraced labor), and the inferred lens—Causal with Accumulative texture—holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph (Elara, sterile facility, tonight). The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through layered sensory translation (drumming → data → light → memory fusion) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the auric lagoon materializes but Leo's absence is undeniable. Cost is visible: "the space beside her where Leo should have been" and "a duet for one." The single meaningful tightening (hesitant rhythm → complex bridge) is sufficient for this length, and the closure image reweights the premise with palpable emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drive lens is Causal; Silas accepts the challenge, navigates obstacles, and retrieves the manifest through motivated steps. Closure is a Decisive Change in social standing (whisper reputation versus shout), signaled in the final exchange. However, the cost is conceptual and future-oriented rather than felt on the page—Silas walks away with pure victory, no price paid in this moment. Orientation is clean; the structure is a single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the darkness acknowledges the light ("a soft luminescence bloomed"), the oppressive pressure eases to "quiet that felt like sleep," and Kaelen leaves one shutter-slat open as a permanent promise—a Charged Poise that reconfigures the relationship between guardian and darkness with visible cost (ongoing vigilance). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (weaving light through shutters, building a "language without sound") and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reflected spark plunges beneath and the darkness responds, narrowing the question from "will it listen?" to "will it understand?"

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: the synchronized displays pattern across the town, building density toward the final image where Maya's thought reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"The future was no longer a declaration to be obeyed, but a conversation that had just begun"—with the cost felt in the shift from resignation to curiosity. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elias, library, mist, prophecy context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the displays go live and collective subconscious shifts, though the causality is more tonal than action-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Causal with lyric texture: scrimshaw → cove → whale call → island rise → departure. Closure is a Decisive Change (Kaelen leaves land permanently) with visible relational cost (Elara left behind, her acceptance earned). Orientation anchors quickly (docks, Kaelen, Elara, post-violence world). One meaningful tightening: Elara's plea opens the path to the ritual. Cost is legible in "he did not look back again" and her "aching acceptance."

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias carves a space for feeling through methodical ritual, and the final image—bird nestled in dried flowers—reweights the opening performance with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost (the remade hush, a pocket of forbidden sorrow). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered actions (tea, narration, whittling) that converge in the charged final tableau. The single-scene design with clear who/where/when anchoring and one meaningful deepening (from performance to private act to integration) fits scope. Cost is legible: he has cultivated lightness, but it is "not happiness," and the price is isolation within a state that forbids his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (Kael, cobalt atrium, first day after ban lifts) and follows a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as Kael moves from observation to immersive understanding. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the colonnade becomes "kindred spirit," the lake shifts from intimidating to inviting), but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than visible on the page—no concrete action is foreclosed, no tangible price paid. The "tremor of certainty" and decision to write poems are told rather than dramatized, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal chain is coherent: Lyra's fading → Vex seeks the unseen power → Elian reads the plant language → they collaborate on the glass resonator → the offering awakens Lyra. Closure is a Decisive Change (Lyra wakes) with felt cost implicit in Vex's tears and Elian's recognition of his "masterpiece," though the cost could be more visible on the page. The lens reads causal with one meaningful tightening when Elian proposes the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elian's pilgrimage through archived data builds pressure through discovery rather than external opposition. Orientation is solid (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The closure—the bell glowing rather than ringing—functions as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: Elian's entire methodology had to shift from auditory to visual, and the "artificial pilgrimage" reaches its end. The lens holds, and the cost is legible in his renunciation of sound-based restoration. One minor slip: the phrase "artificial pilgrimage at its end" tells rather than shows the closure's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the origami sequence builds through pattern and the closure reweights the tattoo stencil's meaning. Orientation is delayed—we don't learn "she" is a separate person until paragraph two, and the observatory's mechanics arrive as exposition in paragraph four rather than through action. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): standing together under shared constellations, then the epilogue image of her at the workbench. Cost is implied but not dramatically visible—what exactly has Elias forfeited or risked by reaching out? The "weeks later" summary compresses the transformation that should carry felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece unfolds as one continuous scene with a brief nested flashback, staying within the two-shard allowance. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara's decision to continue her father's work is reaffirmed, and Julian's understanding reframes his loss as "a single data point in a vast, cyclical, and deeply human equation." The cost is conceptual and social—both characters accept their place in a repeating pattern—but the final image of "twin instruments poised to decode the next great and terrible thing" charges the closure with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara confides her father's theories, tightening the thematic stakes. Causality holds; no major breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: who (Elara, saffron-veil scholar), where (archive, bronze pagoda), and what (interface with Aethel). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual accumulates sensory and emotional density until the final image crystallizes her transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the vessel, identity altered), and the cost is legible on the page ("exquisite, unbearable clarity...cost her everything"). One minor slip: the An-Korin's downfall revelation arrives late and feels expository rather than dramatized through the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates detail through comparison (old footage versus corrupted memory), deepens via the shadow's origin reveal, and lands closure when Kael reweaves the shadow into Elara's archive with visible cost (the light-vines revive to silvery blue, not their original green). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Kael's love holds a soul together by accepting darkness). One meaningful deepening occurs when he identifies the dream-fall as the shadow's origin, narrowing his approach. Cost is legible: the archive is "whole again, saved not by erasing the darkness but by accepting it as the price of her light." Minor penalty for one conceptual echo near the end ("the shape of hope was secure") that slightly restates rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors early (workshop, three nights post-con, chameleon patient). The piece deepens through layered shedding—anger, pride, fear—and culminates in the chameleon's color shift as acceptance, which reweights Elias's stance with visible cost (he had to release shame to restore trust). One meaningful tightening occurs when the prosthetic settles and the creature responds. The closure is clean and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors promptly (tower, post-anesthesia dawn). The tunneling action deepens pressure through the ivy's memory bleeding into his, culminating in the realization that his search itself perpetuates wounding—a clear CR with conceptual cost (he must carry stories, not close them). One meaningful tightening occurs when the expected healing becomes "perfect, awful preservation of the break." No causality breaks; the closure lands with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Elara, projection booth, film strip). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through Arthur's memory, the vision deepens Elara's question, and the final image reweights "unused love" from abstract search to ambient presence in the theater itself. Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing with felt resonance—"It simply becomes the soul of a place"—but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on Elara's part. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds, but the protagonist's agency at closure is observational rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, high peaks, archway, aurora night) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered sensory detail and the intricate meditation ritual, culminating in a cadence shift when the "profound concept" of remembered stardust blooms and reweights the static as cosmic hymn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the rest she sought "settled into her bones…as a perfect, resonant harmony") with conceptual cost visible in the shift from tracing stars to sketching faces—her solitude and instrumental focus are relinquished for human connection. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor triggers the epiphany, transforming her relationship to the psychic noise. The causal linkage from meteor to insight to creative release is clean, though the epiphany's suddenness slightly weakens the inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of interference and synthesis, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) in the crystalline tree—before/after legible, cost felt as renunciation of erasure and acceptance of hybridity. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by line three. One meaningful deepening: the memory's violent intrusion tightens the dilemma, and Kaelen's weaving choice forecloses erasure with visible cost ("You do not have to be what you were"). Closure coheres under the lens and makes cost undeniable in the tree's geometry and Kaelen's first dream-feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds toward the cathedral-tree, the hum crescendos, and the protagonist's understanding crystallizes in the final third. However, the closure unit—"he understood" followed by thematic summary—delivers Conceptual Repricing through assertion rather than image or action that makes cost undeniable on the page. The "cost proof test" fails: no specific sentence in the ending beat shows a visible price, only a declared shift in perspective. The lens holds, but the closure lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the walk through mist, the star-stamped ticket, and the final turn into clearing function as a pattern that deepens until the closure image reweights the opening vigil. Orientation anchors (twilight stone, ferry guides, ridgeway) arrive cleanly within the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's turn into the mist with star-marked kelp crystallizes readiness with felt cost (severing from "a country of ghosts"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ticket's glow pulses with her heartbeat, narrowing the choice to personal commitment. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of the old life and the solitary walk forward.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (cobalt fortress, stair-stain, bolt) and a single meaningful deepening when Elias moves from silent endurance to leaving the bolt, reweighting the dominant stake of facing the cost of safety. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bolt beside the teacup crystallizes the unspoken question with undeniable pressure and felt cost—he has broken his own protective silence and cannot undo it. The cost is legible in "walked away without waiting," foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: cryptic messages accumulate across centuries, converge as light streams, and discharge through the pellet at closure. The rune's dissolution is a Conceptual Repricing—the false star flickers, the pretender's claim unravels—with conceptual cost legible in "edicts would ring with a sudden tinny note." One meaningful deepening occurs when collected energy focuses into the pellet, reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Aris, Tethys station, post-ban monitoring duty). The piece operates under a Causal lens: environmental confluence triggers the tapping sequence, the missing central rhythm is discovered via the atlas symbol, and the reef vision materializes as earned closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration—Aris shifts from drifting searcher to moored keeper of periodic memory—lands with visible cost (he cannot hold the vision permanently, only "once in a while"). One meaningful tightening through the neap-tide alarm narrows his window and forces assembly now-or-never.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Causal: Elara's humming causes the stones to pulse, which causes old systems to awaken, which causes distant receivers to activate—each beat follows motivated linkage. Closure arrives on-page as a Decisive Change (the lull is over; the satellite acknowledges) with felt cost visible in her months of secret practice and the physical toll ("energy of the circle still coursing through her"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the hum layers and the monoliths respond, narrowing her path to this single method.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when early (Elara at geothermal pool during reconstruction), satisfying orientation. The drive lens reads as Causal: kite script → plant communion → environmental manipulation → amber unsealing → embryo activation. However, the closure unit—Elara watching the embryo begin growth—offers no on-page cost, reversal, or foreclosed option; it is pure affirmation ("a new tradition had begun, not by accident, but by design") without visible sacrifice, failure, or trade-off. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the closure lacks the felt or conceptual price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change, capping the score despite clean causality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with legible cost: Anya returns to her work knowing the sky remains menacing, foreclosing any fantasy of recovery. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—somatic panic accumulates until the grounding technique reweights her stance. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3), and the single meaningful deepening (shadow → panic spiral → grounding → return to work) tightens options without requiring multiple reversals. Cost is visible in "It meant nothing. It meant everything" and the final acknowledgment that hope must be "anchored to the solid ground of reality."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the layered work with box fragments, threads, charcoal, forming a spiral cartography that reweights his fragmentation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (lighthouse, library, portrait artist). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the final map on the floor and "quiet, resilient sense" crystallize a new relationship to brokenness with felt cost (years of silence, blackened fingers, the long climb still ahead). One meaningful deepening when he shifts from attempting repair to charting fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening beat (who, where, when all anchored). Drive lens reads as Causal with a light Accumulative layer; the drone's arrival triggers the rockslide context, and Kael's pursuit unfolds in motivated sequence. Closure is a Decisive Change (Kael disappears into the quantum thread) with conceptual cost (he leaves his kin, steps into an unknown state), though the cost feels more promised than viscerally paid on the page. The ink-gateway mechanism is signaled and executed, but the final image of "elsewhere…between" edges toward abstraction rather than a concrete reweighting of prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (archivist, Grand Archive, blizzard isolation) land cleanly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Causal: discovery → moral conflict → encryption → dispersal. Closure delivers a Charged Poise—Elara waits for consequences with the weight of what was to come—reconfiguring her sanctuary into a site of sedition with felt cost ("profound betrayal"). The cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (finding the letter narrows options to preserve or release) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recursive motifs (sandbag scrap, knife, quiet, rose) build pressure toward the sheathing moment, which functions as Earned Stasis—a renunciation that forecloses the violent path with felt cost. The cost is legible in "coffin for a future she would not entertain" and the returned peace "stronger now, more resilient." One meaningful deepening occurs on the page, satisfying the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph and establishes a clear quest structure under a Causal lens: Kaelen must navigate the garden to catch the echo. The climax delivers an on-page manifestation of the goddess's echo through the rail spike strike, which constitutes a Decisive Change. However, the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than viscerally legible—the spike gains "a new kind of memory" and Kaelen's "soul" is "alight," but no visible option is foreclosed or tactic altered. The story teaches early that this is the night "when patterns break themselves," but the promised unpredictability never forces a mid-course correction that narrows Kaelen's options.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens: journalist's call → Celeste retrieves evidence → phone confrontation → brother's guilt revealed. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the father's orbit complete, Celeste's understanding deepened), with felt cost in the form of the father's lifelong prison of suspicion. The orientation is clear by the opening beat. However, the middle escalation is intellectual argumentation rather than a tightening of options or stakes; the contradiction method resolves the external problem but doesn't visibly foreclose a path for Celeste herself, softening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens: letters → Laboratory → firmware encounter → etching ritual → silence. Orientation anchors (tattooist, studio, bruised sky) land within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hum ceases, the voice rests) with visible cost: he externalizes the scar by hanging the leather Lyra on the wall, a memorial that forecloses his prior evasion. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frantic text shifts to calm, driven by Elian's etching action, which narrows his emotional options and ends the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the gathering silence, the tile flake discovery, and the mandala's construction, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (fragile shared focus) that reweights the hush from isolating symptom to potential communion. Cost is present but oblique—Elara's gesture is an offering, not a guarantee, and the hush remains unbroken by voice—yet the final image of shared focus carries conceptual weight under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (ancient plaza, shattered sky, Kaelen and the Retro) land early. The causal lens is clean: Kaelen retrieves the tessera, places it in the stepping stone, channels energy, renames the man, and the man emerges calm and empty. The closure—Ren's blank clarity and Kaelen's sad resolve to continue—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the cost is felt in Kaelen's "hollow ache" and the man's emptied identity). However, the cost is more asserted than shown; we don't see Kaelen hesitate or the man resist in a way that narrows options or raises stakes mid-process. The final image reweights prior material but lacks a visible forfeiture at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Causal lens: Julian perceives Elara's despair, performs echoes in escalating waves, and produces her transformation. Closure lands on the page—Elara stands, pockets the coin without flipping it, and exits—with visible cost (she relinquishes the binary choice the coin represented). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One minor friction: the mechanics of "fractured timeline" and how Julian "pulls threads" remain somewhat decorative rather than constraint-bearing, but the because/therefore chain from perception → echo layering → applause surge → decision holds without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal-Hybrid trending Accumulative at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (studio, camera remote, Lena across the room). The core sequence—first image captures grief, second captures love, recognition creates their "perfect, irrefutable language"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) with felt cost: Elias's skepticism cracks, and they commit to a private system over external validation. One tightening deepens the dominant stake (connection post-pills). Cost is legible in "hairline crack in a solid wall" and the mutual vulnerability of reaching out despite doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates emotional-residue imagery (blues/greens → crimson/violet → overwhelming unnamed consciousness) toward a transcendent merger that constitutes Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). Closure lands on the page with the translated waveform and her new role as "first speaker," reweighting her abstract quest into tangible reality. Cost is somewhat conceptual—she becomes voice of the planetary consciousness—but the final image of carrying "the first translated syllable" makes the before/after legible. Orientation is swift (cave mapper, post-hibernation world, ~40 words). One tightening: null-space → overwhelming chamber → floating merger.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Kaelen, amber warehouse, prophecy-driven duty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens—button-by-button cataloging deepens understanding until the final toggle unlocks coherent truth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Kaelen refuses to turn the hourglass, carrying his chart and jar into dawn; the cost is legible (he abandons his post, breaks the cycle) and the image reweights the prophecy as "a comma, a pause waiting for a new clause." One minor causality slip: the jar's whispers "soften" and "sharpen" as he catalogs, but the mechanism linking button placement to voice clarity remains impressionistic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens: Kestrel's arrival → snow-code message → revelation she's alive → Elias commits to the Pyrenees. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change—Elias shifts from paralyzed guilt to forward motion—with a felt cost (he must now act on incomplete intelligence and risk the network closing in). One weakness: the final cost is more anticipated than paid on the page; the "steady, measured pace" ending declares resolve but doesn't dramatize a forfeiture or tactical sacrifice in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (coachman, fog-bound crossing, forced pause) and builds pressure through layered sensory input (chain clank, river slosh, dripping) that permits memory to surface. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias understands the promise not as failure but as persistent compassion, and the bell tone signals readiness to move forward—options reweighted, path cleared. The cost is conceptual and felt: he relinquishes the literal return but accepts the ache that humanizes his work. One meaningful deepening (memory percolates → comprehension coalesces → action resumes) is sufficient for this length; the inferred lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands clearly: Kaelen's understanding crystallizes through the completed channel work, and the answer to his question appears on-page with felt cost (his own small act woven into eternal memory). The accumulative/textural lens holds—each act of kindness deepens the thrum and brings visions more vividly until the final handful of clay completes the pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when watering the rose unlocks the vision, shifting his purpose from observation to restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through nightly repetition and sensory density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the blinds widen—a visible response that reweights her solitary ritual with shared cadence. Cost is felt in her sustained effort and the hour-long vigil. Orientation anchors (fire escape, Mr. Henderson's window below, harbor) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when observation becomes reciprocal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly (Kael, tidal library, post-reincarnation memory) by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the hum of the stone circle deepens and reweights Kael's relationship to his memories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance as "reservoir" rather than "relic"). The closure effect is legible and on the page, though the cost is more conceptual (renouncing the fight against memory) than viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening satisfies the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through sensory density and pattern (wet surfaces, thread metaphor, adding objects to the web) until the final image reweights Elara's isolation into belonging. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—she lets go of the nest and feels the "invisible tug of the thread," a stance crystallization with felt cost (surrendering her tangible symbol). One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the nest and the installation transforms under sunlight, narrowing her separation and opening connection.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara proves the tricksters are not untouchable, and the final image ("quiet hope humming into the divided world below") crystallizes her stance with visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing vigilance). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The causal lens holds: her weeks of reverse-engineering enable the counter-frequency, the transmission causes the fever to break, and the cost (lonely station, perpetual night shifts, tricksters will adapt) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when she engages the sequence and watches the quad.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: entering the nexus → playing the chord → focused hum strikes keystone → space stabilizes → chamber revealed. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost (sanity tested, physical ordeal endured), and the folio discovery reweights the quest from personal reclamation to world-mending knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs when the organ enrages the nexus, narrowing options to a single desperate gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains clear spatial grounding throughout. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered opposing images (stone/mist, joy/despair, vibrant color/gray) that culminate in the scratch-wound as Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands with conceptual cost—empathy awakened through understanding absence—though the felt cost remains somewhat abstract. The method is signaled early and paid off, but the resonance depends heavily on thematic assertion rather than a choice that forecloses a concrete path.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: Elias opens a secure channel holding evidence, his voice steady—a Decisive Change with felt cost (ending a century of lies, risking institutional backlash). The causal chain from discovery → decoding → physical quest → reversal rite → formal challenge holds cleanly under a Causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the nail unlocks the logbook, narrowing options and raising stakes. Minor issue: the "cartographical curse" mechanic arrives late and feels convenient, but prior clues (coded stanzas, exile theory) provide enough groundwork to avoid a full causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit—Elias beginning to play the scaffold rhythm—reads as Charged Poise: options crystallize (learn the code, find his door) with conceptual cost implied in the question mark of "impossible hope." However, the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing is visible. The middle accumulates descriptive density (glass flake detail, scaffold observation) but lacks a meaningful pressure turn that reweights his stance before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens (causal tactics in the haunting beats, accumulative thematic pattern in the reflections) and delivers closure through Conceptual Repricing: Elias's final realization reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—he hasn't broken the cycle, only stepped outside it by understanding it. Orientation anchors quickly (circus train, Elias, surveyors). One meaningful escalation occurs when the CEO confronts Elias and leaves unnerved, narrowing the startup's options. The closure lands cleanly on the page with felt cost: the satchel becomes "a map of the road not taken."

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (observatory, Elian, tonight). The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through the dream sequence, and the final writing act reweights the dominant stake (decoding) into a thematic recognition (shared sorrow). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elian honors the lament rather than solving it, and the cost is conceptual (abandoning the quest for a cipher solution). The transition from waking to dream to dawn is legible, and the telegram's star chart establishes causality for the variable-star method. Minor slip: the civilization's encoding into starlight is introduced late without prior setup, creating a small retroactive patch, but the closure image ("no longer his alone to carry") lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors early (Elara, cursed lake, post-failed-trick timeframe by paragraph one). The causal lens holds: ritual → vortex breach → branch discovery → unbending → confession release → seed planting. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Elara's guard unbends with visible emotional cost ("wept not for what was lost, but for the simple, devastating truth"), and the seed plants a living monument that will cleanse the curse, reweighting her grief into forward action. Cost is legible in the weeping and the years-long quest resolved. One meaningful deepening (branch straightens, confession emerges) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal-Situational Hybrid dominant at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara creates a new vector through dream-space, the thread is pulled straight, and "a path to begin weaving" crystallizes options with felt cost (the covenant remains broken, the future tangled, but one thread now clear). The escalation moves from vision → psychic connection → warning received → synthesis → new path created, each beat narrowing options under pressure. Cost is legible: she anchors herself to roots, burns her palm on the clipping, and the glade holds its breath as reality thins—genuine prices paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Aris reweights the burned tarot card from penance to guard stone, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (his lost academy future offered to the shadow). Orientation anchors quickly (catacomb orchard, Aris, present action). Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative hybrid—each memory offered narrows options and the final burial transforms prior material. One meaningful tightening (shadow encroachment → memory sacrifice → root breakthrough) with cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear by line three (quarry office trailer, Elias alone, dawn approaching). The piece follows a single continuous scene with Causal lens: because he opens the box, he finds the cloth; because the cloth snags, he must wrestle it free; because he frees it, memory floods in and changes his relationship to the object. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he places the cloth on his desk as "evidence" rather than discarding or cataloging it, a renunciation of his decade-long project of emotional insulation with visible cost (he must now live beside this wound daily). The final image "evidence that there had been a show, and that even after the applause, something always remained" reweights the dominant stake (discovering purpose after loss) with felt cost, though the conceptual price could be slightly more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (magnetic arbor above clouds), and when (three cycles post-loss) by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): planting the seed and witnessing the luminescent filament reweight her haunted ambition into illuminated anticipation with felt cost (the ongoing distance). The piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through repeated observations, the seed ritual, and the final sprouting image that recharges the arbor's hum and Kael's memory. One meaningful deepening: the waveform analogy crystallizes her stance and the sprout's appearance answers her question without words, shifting her from torment to anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: moon-charged water, memory-ore fragments, and the forge-basin pattern build toward the smelting transformation and the creation of memory-smelt. Orientation anchors (titan-gear librarian, tidal atrium, post-linear-time setting) arrive early. The closure—memory-ore refined into silver fish, placed back in the creel—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the cycle completes with wonder preserved), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The "awaiting the next tide" coda confirms cyclical stasis rather than decisive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with a clear Decisive Change: Elias crowns the crystal, triggering light that broadcasts the rescued hopes. Cost is conceptual—he breaks his inspector's oath and repurposes the bunker's sealing mechanism—but the price is legible in the final image. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: discovery of the pearl, recognition of its attribute, and the resonant hum build density toward the eruption. One minor orientation slip: "Torlan crystal caves" and "Site 73" lack anchoring detail early, though the grotto interior is vividly established by mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias renounces the accordion and the obsessive cartography, accepting that guilt is a tributary rather than a destination. The graffiti acts as catalyst, the accordion's wheezing note as acknowledgment, and the walk-out as foreclosure with felt cost. Causal lens holds: medication stop → raw nerves → map quest → graffiti insight → instrument release. One strengthening move (the note sequence) tightens pressure before the walk-out. Cost is visible: he leaves his father's music to find his own.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear premise (navigate the library before the second letter arrives) and delivers an on-page closure unit: Elara documents "Stay," the library dissolves, and she turns to face the messenger with the journal as evidence of her discovery. This qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) since the final image crystallizes her stance and the cost—time expended, veil now a relic, the coming confrontation—is felt. However, the escalation is primarily spatial and accumulative (moving through fog, triangulating light motes) without a meaningful tightening of options or a causal reversal that narrows her path; the watch guides her smoothly rather than forcing a trade-off. The closure cost is implied but not viscerally dramatized on the page, which prevents entry into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page through Decisive Change: Elias writes the truth report and walks away with the cutting, forecloses his imperial career with visible cost. The causal lens is clear and consistent: plant-memory contradicts official history → coffee-reading confirms branching path → he acts on both, choosing propagation over prestige. Orientation is clean by paragraph one (observatory, midsummer morning, his task). One meaningful tightening occurs when the two "secrets" converge into unbearable truth. The cost is concrete: he leaves the report, the violin, and his allegiance behind.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative lens: Elara's ritual unfolds in a single continuous scene with clear setup (fading soul) → method (pattern-finding) → infusion → archival closure. Orientation anchors emerge by ~100 words (grotto, aurora, obsidian slab). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she completes the ritual and stores the memory, foreclosing the soul's dissolution. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no on-page sentence makes tangible what Elara sacrifices or risks in this particular act, weakening closure punch.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is swift: who, where, what by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the tree-climb reflection and scalloping action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image—water flowing, light pulsing, warmth spreading—reweights "contentment" from passive to participatory with felt cost (the act of intervention that breaks her caretaker lineage's passive trust). The closure lands cleanly. One minor gap: the hairpin's leap from memento to tool feels slightly under-motivated in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure crystallizes through wind, mirror, and dawn into a stance reconfiguration. Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse, dawn, North Atlantic) within the first 120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kaelen unclasps and sheds the cloak, a visible renunciation with on-page cost (shivers, cash left, walks "less certain"). The because/therefore chain holds: night confession → wind chime oracle → hollow mirror confrontation → cloak shedding. One meaningful tightening occurs when the brass chime clang interrupts the shells, externalizing Kaelen's resistance before the mirror moment forces the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ripple meditation builds density through layered metaphor (stone/intention, rings/action, reversal/gathering-in) and culminates in a cadence shift when the rings contract backward, delivering the delayed revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Kael's understanding reweights the premise of appearing/vanishing with felt cost—he must cease insisting he is "here." The cost is legible in "release of the anchor" and "letting go," though it remains slightly more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory discovery (new frequency → arrowhead → bird-pattern reading → harmonic release) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Kaelan's consciousness-path unfurls. Orientation anchors by line 3 (canyon, towers of bone, Kaelan's name and art). The closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Kaelan does not physically leave but gains the psychic pathway, and the cost is the patience and reverence that shaped the entire vigil. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flock fractures, revealing the hunter's story and reweighting the pulse from obstacle to task. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (centuries of waiting, the release of the wandering pulse) and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly: who (Kael), where (icebound spire), when (automated-magic age) by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Causal: mist-walking arrival → diagnostic failures → despair → unstrapping → resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the keystone awakens internal resonance, foreclosing reliance on automated methods with visible cost: abandoning the pack and tools). The because/therefore chain holds and the cost is legible on the page. Minor: the final paragraph's abstraction ("a way of seeing") slightly softens the concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (pier, gas lamps, memorial night). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pilgrimage ritual → descent → library float → synesthetic answer, building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid). Cost is present but muted—Silas surfaces "exhausted and calm" without visible forfeiture or tactical shift, and the vow's fulfillment lacks on-page friction. The library sequence stalls momentum with extended description before the payoff, and the closure image ("the world was quiet, but… not empty") leans toward assertion rather than dramatized reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: "uncoin the void" reweights the entire premise from future-seeking to past-curation with conceptual cost (he has spent his purpose pursuing the wrong universe). Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative final turn; the coin-draw decision → sensor recalibration → static fracture → memory echo forms a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The backwards-prophecy payoff is legible and recontextualizes prior material, though the "billion ghosts" moment could have shown one micro-choice to charge the acceptance further.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when in the opening lines and accumulates pressure through layered sensory detail, memory fragments, and the crystallization ritual. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kael does not heal, but he charts his grief and gives it form, foreclosing the option of remaining lost with the felt cost visible in "still a heartbroken reaper." The lens holds cleanly; each beat deepens rather than causally turns. One meaningful tightening occurs when he channels "the entirety of his purpose" into the prism, narrowing focus to the final act. Cost is legible in the closing image: the scar-crystal and the acknowledgment that healing is impossible for a reaper.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael completes the song with visible cost (magic utterly spent) and the patch of darkened dust below makes the potential tangible. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the ninety-seven-day pattern culminates in a cadence shift (ting…tong) that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clean by the opening lines. One meaningful tightening (the interval adjustment) is sufficient for this length. Cost is legible: exhaustion, slumped posture, and the shift from futility to fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The structure is a two-shard design (descent to ruins, archive/attic research; then ledger correction and hall display) within one continuous window. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias corrects the record with visible cost (official signature, public exposure) and transforms haunting into shared history. The cost is legible in the deliberate act and its public consequence. One meaningful tightening: the trail of photographs narrows from mystery to family identity to Elias's own lineage, reweighting his vigil's purpose. Orientation is prompt (name, role, place, twilight time by line two). No causality breaks; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The piece builds through Elias's frustration → recalled grimoire → starling observation → crystal discovery → locket reverence → sublimation, culminating in a Charged Poise moment where logic and intuition embrace. Orientation anchors (Elias, orchard, dusk) arrive promptly. The closure lands with conceptual cost (dissolving "rigid scaffolding"), though the felt price could be sharper. The lens holds; one meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Kael sends the silent warning, preserving trust with visible cost (the hollow ache, the consequences "just beginning to spread"). The causal lens holds throughout—storm clears → new data reveals threat → calibration under pressure → warning sent. Orientation is prompt (arbor, midnight pattern seeker, post-storm silence by first paragraph). One meaningful tightening (the crystal dial moment) narrows options and charges the final image. The cost is legible in "The action was over, but its consequences were just beginning."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (Kael, floating dojo, post-ego-death present) land within the first paragraph. The vivify sequence provides one meaningful tightening: Kael's choice to channel opposites sparks the brain into independent thought, and the story closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—responsibility cracks the numbness without full resolution, options are reconfigured, and the cost (new dependency, vulnerability) is legible in "terrifying" and the thought *Query: What is this place?* The clone custody battle as dramatic scaffolding feels thin on the page (Jin's protest is brief, resolved by act rather than negotiation), slightly weakening mid-escalation, but closure coheres and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the wife's fragile smile seeds healing) with felt emotional cost visible on the page. The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative lens: density builds through sensory layering (dust motes, brittle leaves, half-sung lullaby) to a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (ghost, garage, three seasons post-death). One meaningful deepening (the wife hears the tune beneath the scream) narrows emotional options and forecloses the prior stagnation with visible tears and the twitching smile.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Lyel refuses the portal, sacrificing his chance at home to protect the library, then reframes his waiting from longing-for-home to open expectation. Cost is visible: "The ache in his chest remained" and the portal "sealed itself shut." Orientation anchors early (guardian, frozen garden, library). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the pendant's cold weight, the mist's recurrence, and the final sigh layer to reweight his stance. One meaningful deepening when the portal tears open, narrowing his choice to leap or stay.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece holds a clear Causal lens: successive failed attempts → insight about method → altered approach → closure. The closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (the crozier dissolves into light-flower) with visible cost (destruction of the relic and exhaustion of materials). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The epiphany beat ("And that was when the penny drops") uses a colloquial idiom that momentarily breaks the established register, but the turn itself is motivated by prior pattern (his desperation, the shepherd metaphor). The light-flower's emergence feels slightly convenient—no resistance or complication in the final attempt—but the reweighting of "creative destruction" into "surrender" provides conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara achieves the shard of hush, proving a new method works, with the cost visible in her risk and the tower "waiting" rather than abandoned. Causality is clean—each discarded assumption builds to the breakthrough. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening (the perigee zenith threatening system overload) narrows options and delivers the closure under a Causal lens with conceptual cost (she learned to "un-ask").

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (ferry, harbor, grotto). The closure lands on-page: Finn heals the rupture and returns to normal reality, but the cost is abstract—"a feeling of permanent transient...forever caught between shores"—more assertion than embodied consequence. The causal lens holds (observation → pattern recognition → radio manipulation → merger), though the leap from noticing geometry to "merge parallel timelines" is abrupt. One meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from distress call to "symphony of static."

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, gallery, present continuous) establish quickly. The piece follows a causal lens: memory alteration → thread texture change → lattice rupture → vision manifestation. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (the "texture of connection" proves cold and imprisoning) with cost made explicit in the final lines ("perfectly rational, beautifully enchanted cage"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the memory shifts and the structure "vibrates," narrowing options to incorporation. The felt cost is clear, though the final image leans slightly toward declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story deepens through layered work (secret research, pattern discovery, public presentation) that reweights the anchor motif at closure. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the anchor shifts from symbol of grounding to "first link in a new chain"—with conceptual cost (abandoning the seabed paradigm, expanding the city's definition of home). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen's research clicks and he brings it to the council, altering the city's conceptual map. The cost is felt but remains largely aspirational ("his work had just begun") rather than a decisive on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Leo's panic softens to peace; Elias completes the circuit and departs). The causal lens holds: hearing-aid signal → locate Leo → deliver reassurance → signal fades. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frantic pulse becomes a lullaby. Cost is present but muted—Leo's worry eases, yet no path is visibly foreclosed; Elias walks away unchanged. The closure image reweights prior material without deep sacrifice, qualifying as RR but not at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: chronometer → collapse obstacle → phase transition → console act → release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghosts wink out, Elias feels "blessedly open")—an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost (alone but unhaunted). The four-hour tidal window creates clean pressure and the ending image reweights prior material. Minor gap: the phase-transition mechanism arrives late without prior setup, slightly weakening the earned quality of the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Elara, opal observatory, post-static). The accumulative/textural lens holds: the defragmentation ritual builds density through the ink-manipulation beats until the star-chart revelation crystallizes meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"architecture in the darkness between" reweights both Aris's failure and Elara's bureaucratic-error existence with visible conceptual cost (she must embrace the gap rather than reject it). One meaningful deepening through the ink coalescing into purposeful diagram narrows her understanding decisively. Cost is felt in the final acceptance image, though the porcelain shard's symbolic weight does some lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece orients early (Kaelen, Chasm of In-An, bone towers, dying language), follows a clear Causal lens (years of seeking → dusk observation → starling-pattern recognition → diamond alignment → silence → new word), and delivers an on-page Decisive Change: the first true word of the Old Tongue emerges. Cost is present but oblique—Kaelen becomes "the storyteller with no stories" holding "the first line of a new one"—a conceptual repricing rather than a visible forfeiture. The causality is clean, but the cost at closure could be more legible and felt on the page to anchor the transformation with undeniable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Julian, underground garden, post-return timeframe) land within the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Julian's investigation → discovery of grotto → witnessing transformation → realization → renunciation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Julian's refusal to expose the place forecloses his mission with felt cost (abandoning his job, accepting Clara's loss). The cost is legible in "no hope of getting Clara back...but a frostbitten hope bloomed" and the final commitment to protect rather than expose.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lens is Causal with accumulative elements (the locust shell's weeks-long process, the final transformation). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change—the orchard is reawakened, the statues reclaimed—and it occurs on the page with visual transformation. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual: the story tells us the statues are "pulled down...into the soil, becoming one with the life they were built to suppress," but we don't witness Elara's visible sacrifice or forfeiture. The final paragraph offers thematic repricing ("breaking free wasn't about destroying the old") but the price paid by Elara herself is exhaustion without a legible forfeited path or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the successful transfer and bluebird confirmation constitute a Decisive Change (the daughter's ghost reunited) with visible cost (the bottle's energy spent, the risk taken). The inferred lens is Causal—Elias maps gaps, times the convergence, unleashes static, and completes the upload in a tight because/therefore chain. Orientation is swift (mailman, disputed territory, twilight, postbox by paragraph one). One meaningful tightening occurs when the static wave creates the corridor and the upload streams through, narrowing options to a thirty-second window. Cost is legible: the bottle's power is consumed, the fragile peace is temporary, and Elias's rebellion is quiet but real.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through restoration work, discovery, and installation toward a final cadence shift when Elias sings. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph one). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the singing transforms the silence from absence into "a listening, a space made sacred by a sound," with the cost legible in "a low, resonant vibration that hadn't been used in a decade." One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragment flares and the moment overwhelms him. The lens holds and the cost is felt, though the singing as physical act could be more visibly difficult or compromised to sharpen the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the ritual's escalation (chart consultation, scarf draping, geometric alignment), culminating in the vision that reweights the dominant stake ("he had touched it...proven the path"). Closure is Charged Poise—the moment of contact dissolves but reconfigures his project with felt cost (patience, incremental proof vs. capture). One tightening is sufficient for this length and lens; causality holds throughout the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is on the page: the light coalesces into a "warm, shimmering presence" that fills the void, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—the chase ends, he accepts the presence). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: years of collected light-fragments culminate in the fog-diffused sunrise that completes the cipher. Cost is felt but quiet—years spent, loneliness endured—though the final beat could render that cost more sharply in the moment of vitalization. One meaningful deepening occurs when the palette hums and all glimmers resonate together.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Locksmith, stone circle, woman with lock of hair). The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory layering (twilight → starlight → humming → ribbon untying) toward a release moment. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the music freed, the woman's grief eased), but the cost remains asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, no option narrowed, no visible price paid by either character. The lens holds, but the closure lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the recovered memory fragment reweights Elias's decades of observation into a beginning rather than endpoint, with the cost implicit in "an ache that was both hollow and full." Drive lens reads as Accumulative—density builds through layered observation, fractured starlight, and the pulsing mushroom until the pattern breaks with contact. Orientation anchors cleanly (submersible, greenhouse dome, Elias as folklorist) within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the light fracture signals "a new signature, or an old one waking up," narrowing his options and forcing the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara refuses the journey and chooses to rebuild in exile, forecloses escape with visible cost ("She would learn to unpick the knots, right here, with him"). The piece operates under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when Kael finishes the map and pushes it away, narrowing her choice to leave or stay. The cost—remaining in a "forgotten place"—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: the seed sprouts, vibrancy expands, and the orchard is restored. Cost is conceptual—Elian has spent his lineage's singular anchor—but the price is asserted retrospectively ("heirloom seed... waiting for its ultimate purpose") rather than felt in the moment of planting. The lens reads Causal (because/therefore: greyness → vigil recognized → essence captured → seed infused → restoration), and the chain holds without contradiction. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The single tightening (creeping greyness → precisely timed planting) is sufficient for this length, though the resolution unfolds without friction or adaptation once the method begins.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory intensification ("light...seeming to vibrate," "wave of profound cold") and the pattern of knot-unraveling as closure method. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 ("my apprentice, Kaelen, stood beside me"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen takes the needle, the weight of "thousands more" knots now "resting fully on his shoulders," crystallizing the apprentice's new burden with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the knot loosens and the sanctuary's hush "knits itself back together, stronger now," reweighting the dominant stake from frayed silence to partial restoration. Cost is legible in the "familiar exhaustion" and the enormity of the task ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is crisp: who (map framer), where (workshop), what (torn map of northern isles) anchored by the second paragraph. The causal lens holds: Elara's research leads to the archives, the footage comparison reveals the lichen disruption, which reinterprets the map tear as deliberate threshold. The closure—annotating "threshold found"—lands with conceptual cost (acknowledgment of the unknown) and reconfigures the tear from damage to intentional marker. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lichen line is discovered, narrowing options from restoration to preservation of mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (submersible, library, investigation motive). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator's insight about letting go forecloses the path of recovery/possession with visible cost (leaving the globe, documenting rather than salvaging). Causality is clean—discovery leads to retrieval, note reading, and conceptual repricing. One meaningful deepening occurs when the snow globe's nature is revealed, narrowing the narrator's options and charging the final image with the decision to leave it behind.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual builds through layered sensory detail and the graffiti's symbolic language until the mist coalesces into a spectral reply. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the flower and melody validate Elian's effort, and the warm bolt plate signals receipt. Cost is legible but muted—"temporary," "fleeting grace note"—rendering the stakes more declarative than visceral. The lightning-to-thunder timeframe brackets the action cleanly, and causality holds within the ritual's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Inferred lens: Causal/Accumulative Hybrid—the elevator ascent structures beats causally (floor markers trigger discovery steps) while the diary's unfolding accumulates meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is Charged Poise: Kael steps into his new life holding the Captain's secret, the final image reconfiguring his relationship to her memory with visible cost (he must carry knowledge he cannot share). Orientation is immediate (Kael, crystal elevator, icebound spire). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sketch reframes all prior anguish as maternal armor. Cost is legible: "affectionate detachment" and "silent knowledge" foreclose intimacy and full grief.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's hypothesis is confirmed when he recognizes Lena's fractal signature in the noctilucent cloud, and he shifts from searcher to curator with palpable peace. The cost is visible—he stops recording, his "work was done," foreclosing the active quest. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each named cloud builds density until the final pattern break ("This was the proof") reweights all prior material. Orientation anchors emerge cleanly by the second paragraph (sky gondola, post-mooring-snap drift). One meaningful deepening (the noctilucent discovery) suffices at this length and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: the sky blooms within walls about to fall, crystallizing the guild's ambition with an undeniable bittersweet cost (sanctuary achieved, destruction imminent). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern (fractal), sensory density (light veins), and cadence shift (from silence to cerulean bloom) reweight the stake. Orientation anchors promptly (Elara, tree trunk library, condemned building). One tightening: the lock mechanism narrows options, then the heartwood placement completes the task. Cost is felt in the juxtaposition of cosmos and collapse, though it is opportunity rather than decision cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through pattern density (starlings, hopscotch, phrasebook cant, final luminance sighting) rather than because/therefore causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias moves from "apprentice" to "cartographer," and his "great discovery" reweights from place to conversation—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The tightening is smooth: observation → frustration → hopscotch insight → bird-reading → luminance reveal. One constraint: the cost at closure (what Elias gives up or forecloses) could be sharper; the "silent, profound communion" reconfigures meaning but the felt price is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative/lyric texture. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (Orrery restored, light shifts from harsh to warm) with visible cost legible in "the driftwood nostalgia in Elara's soul did not vanish"—purpose fulfilled but loneliness persists. Orientation anchors (frozen library, Elara, perpetual twilight) arrive early. The because/therefore chain is clean: prophecy scraps → core chamber → eclipse shadow reveals keyhole → gear insertion → restoration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vial's shadow exposes the crescent lock, narrowing options and forcing the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands on-page (the bell resonates, clearing the magnetic path), but cost is purely mechanical—no visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options or charges the final image. The causal chain (messages → wreckage → bell → arch → resonance) is traceable but thin; each step is accepted without friction or adaptation. The ghost's "Go home" message supplies warm sentiment but no reweighted stake or felt price. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (lighthouse), and what (final ritual) by the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lullaby translation builds density through nested imagery, and the closure reconfigures the opening "witness" frame into active "gift"—a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with felt cost as Elias dissolves. The cost is legible in "last of his energy, his very essence, poured into the pattern" and "fading consciousness." One minor causality softness: the puppet head is placed as "silent audience" but does not constrain or enable the weaving itself, making its presence more symbolic than causal at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elias, cliffside perch, labyrinth below, frost arriving) land within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Causal: horn call → retrieval → assembly → beacon activation → traveler escape, with motivated ellipsis (the assembly itself) that heightens rather than obscures. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias returns to his chair, the nut spent, finding "a sliver of meaning" in one more life saved—visible cost (expended nut, deep chill, unchanged curse) forecloses hope of broader escape and crystallizes his stance. The final image reweights his burden as both curse and fragile purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred: pressure builds through layered observations (milkweed, river braiding, foam coalescence) that deepen understanding without traditional plot turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Aris's realization that "divergence wasn't failure" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (accepting the rift as structure rather than break). The cost is somewhat abstract but legible in "the knot… loosened" and the commitment to write differently. One meaningful tightening occurs when foam patterns crystallize insight.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The story coheres around a single dominant stake (finding the origin) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist moves from seeking a pre-existing origin to creating one through deliberate scarring, an Earned Stasis moment where he forecloses passive searching with visible action and cost. Orientation is clean (shop, library, clouds established early). The closure is on the page and reweights prior material, though the escalation reads as one deepening move rather than tightening pressure across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: fossil → memory-map → pavilion discovery → subsumption → peace. Orientation anchors quickly (chef, fortress courtyard, post-rain). The closure is a clear Decisive Change—Kaelen's touch no longer transmits grief, signaling his internal transformation—with visible cost (he is "scoured clean," "terrifyingly smooth"). One friction: the mechanism by which tasting the fossil reveals a location feels slightly convenient, though the prior puddle-analysis ritual seeds the pattern-reading skill.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (clock tower, harmonious choral librarian role, grain elevator network in crisis). The piece follows a situational lens: Elias faces escalating psychic noise and must restore harmony through his unique method. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the network shifts from screech to polyphonic chorus), with cost implied in "the work was never truly finished" and his exhaustion. The tightening is legible—violent oscillations resolve to stillness—but the cost feels more atmospheric than stakes-altering, keeping this shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elara, canyon workshop, moonlit night of transformation) and follows a single continuous scene under a Causal lens: she initiates the sequence, dives into entangled memories, focuses on the composer's dream, modifies her cortex, and emerges with the dream intact. The closure—Elara integrating the composer's dream and smiling through a tear—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost: the tear, the "secret, silent librarian" solitude). One meaningful tightening occurs when she anchors the composer's dream and the system stabilizes. Cost is legible in the tear and the irreversible neural modification, though the felt weight could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with strong threshold mechanics and clear because/therefore progression from doodle → alignment → pattern revelation. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael gains the combination and accepts the ongoing burden with felt responsibility, though the cost is more internal promise than visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by ~100 words). One meaningful tightening occurs when gravity begins to reverse, forcing the scramble back.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase—each tree adds a note, building to harmony—and the closure reweights the opening silence through the final line "It was listening." Orientation anchors cleanly (Elara, alder grove, dawn after hedgehog season). However, the closure is a Conceptual Repricing without legible cost: the "resonant aftermath" declares transformation but doesn't show what path Elara has foreclosed or what price she paid. The "empathy" method is asserted ("an act of understanding") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening ridge. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through silence-charting until the climactic light display reconfigures the "eclipsed covenant" with visible cost (stone released, exile reweighed). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallizing his new scholar identity—with felt cost (exile's sadness harmonized, not erased). One meaningful deepening through the silence-to-strategy breakthrough suffices at this length. Closure lands on-page with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece sustains a causal lens: Elias's choice to tune by memory rather than machine readings unlocks the clasp, and the fireworks frame creates escalating time pressure. The closure—a click followed by shelving the unread diary—delivers a clear before/after (locked → open, pursuit → preservation) with thematic cost (foregoing the words to honor the silence). One structural seam mars clarity: the phrase "recovering that silent feeling was enough" tells closure rather than letting the shelf-label and fireworks counterpoint dramatize it, costing full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: treetop village, herbalist protagonist, corpse flower seed as test. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a single meaningful deepening when the sensory assault forces Elara to find her still point; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where her cultivation of internal serenity reweights the external ambition. The final image—the still point drawn on wrapping paper—charges prior material with visible cost (relinquishing the urge to block sensation). One causally earned tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens: gravity inversion opens the path, water-flow navigation leads to the Heart, crystal retrieval completes the arc. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land early. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (obtaining the shard) but the cost remains abstract—"racing the re-emerging river" gestures at urgency without on-page consequence or forfeited option. The ending tells us she "had found the planet's memory of strength" rather than showing a trade-off or reweighted stake that closes a live question.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accent (wind-data accumulation → tightening convergence → discovery → complete sequence). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kaelen achieves perfect foresight-in-reverse but stands alone with the weight of knowledge, foreclosing the possibility of prevention with visible cost ("the knowledge was a weight"). The patch discovery functions as a motivated pivot that narrows his investigative vectors, and the final sequence links causally to prior wind-pattern work.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words: who Kael is, why he waits, and what stakes he faces remain vague through the opening paragraphs, violating the Orientation Test (−0.4). The "sculpted hush" and the sculptor's chisel strike are introduced as symbols but never causally linked on the page; the chisel's strike functions as a magic trigger rather than a motivated turn. Closure asserts that wonder is "unfettered" and "certified," but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost is dramatized—the world simply receives the song without visible friction or price. The piece reads as Accumulative in intent, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Kaelen, Thunder-echo range, post-guardianship established by ~80 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight crystallization) with visible cost: he gains understanding but not forgiveness or redemption, and the flute "resting silently in his open palm" signals renunciation with palpable weight. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: driftwood arrangement → flute playing → shimmer → insight → silence forms a tightening spiral where each beat deepens rather than causally propels. One meaningful deepening achieved; cost is legible in "agonizingly clear note of truth."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (Elias, Anya), where (topaz workshop), and the temporal frame (between constellations) by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the machine's ritual until the final embossed card reconfigures Anya's grief as geometry. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (her unbearable weight "recontextualized," not removed); the cost is disorientation and the loss of unmediated feeling. One strong deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (courier, ridge, pendant by paragraph one). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael's still hands and recognition that "this was the wonder" crystallize his shift from routine anxiety to myth-participant, with the conceptual cost of leaving behind the simpler role he longed for. The aurora event accumulates density through phantoms, Elara's echo, and the crystalline garden, then the final paragraph reweights the opening tremor with calm resolve. Cost is felt but could be more visceral—no on-page forfeiture or visible price beyond an internal stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the prism's "brutal literalism" reweights Elias's entire theory and the premise that objects hold poetic memory. The cost is undeniable on the page—his sacred frame collapses into "broken steel and indifferent physics." Causal lens holds: years of failed communion → the convergence of elements (cold, frost, prism, dawn) → the diagram resolves → theory validated but emotionally gutted. Orientation is swift (who, where, what by paragraph one). One meaningful deepening (the rainbow reveals not her but the mechanical snap) tightens stakes and forecloses hope.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—Elara completes the tapestry and loses all context for her love, foreclosing the relationship with visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds: the weaving progresses through seasons, each thread costs a memory, and the final sealing creates a clean before/after. Orientation anchors (loom spinner, forgotten orchard, bamboo forest) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the amber bead and weaves the locking threads, though the midpoint escalation is more additive than a sharp turn that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (blacksmith, failing-orchard world, floating arches) and the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: silk → geode → arch stabilization. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian emerges hollowed but one arch now glows blue, reweighting his capacity against planetary decay with felt cost (lost memories). The "tomorrow" coda crystallizes ongoing stakes. One meaningful tightening (descent, barter, emergence) narrows options and the cost—flavor erased from memory—is legible on the page in "empty words in his head."

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Kael redirects the energy, accepts his sister's loss, and marks the site as finalized. The cost is legible—he loses the hope of rescue and gains only understanding. The piece teaches a Causal lens early (the shard enables sight, the resonance cascade caused Elara's death) and holds it through the redirect action. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy peaks and Kael must act.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: letter discovery → repair decision → stone-circle farewell forms a clean through-line. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Silas cannot protect the keeper but protects the light, and the final stone circle forecloses the relationship with visible cost. The beam-restoration beat and sea-glass reprise charge the ending image. One persistent constraint (the absent keeper) shapes tactics and the final gesture. Cost is legible in "Farewell" and the ache held in the sea glass.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the storm ritual intensifies through description and gesture, building to a final cadence shift ("the dawn was beginning to shape him too"). However, no on-page choice or renunciation creates a legible before/after with felt cost; the ending reweights thematically but lacks a decisive change or visible forfeiture that would qualify as Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words. The story accumulates observational density (sun trails, morpho wing, patron reactions) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Kaelen's realization that "some people don't magnetize stories; they are the prisms" reweights his opening question with conceptual cost (the donor's legacy now understood as perceptual gift, not merely extended time). One causal seam: the woman's final line ("The man this heart belonged to...he saw the world that way too") feels like convenient confirmation rather than earned dramatization, narrowly meeting the RR threshold but lacking a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on Kaelen's part.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Aris completes the cycle from collection through healing toarchival placement, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where his role is accepted with the cost of perpetual witness rather than repair. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—storm, moonlight, and the shard's transformation deepen in a single extended beat. Orientation anchors by line 40 (tower, storm, labyrinth maintenance). One meaningful deepening occurs when pure moonlight accelerates the shard's healing, reweighting the entire process. Cost is visible: he archives grief but cannot erase it, and the mosaic's endless spiral signals the unending nature of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is established early (greenhouse, twilight world, Lumina tree), and the accumulative/textural lens is legible: fragments coalesce into the complete song. The closure lands on the page—the nascent sun bathes the greenhouse, the tree recovers, and Elara's memory becomes whole—constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (her scattered mind begins to heal). However, the cost feels stated rather than felt; the ending asserts hope and healing without dramatizing what Elara has risked or lost in the act of singing. The lens holds, but the final beat lacks visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece densifies through interiority → sensory dissolution → observation → realization, with the smoothed invitation as the closure image that reweights the refusal. Orientation anchors (Athenaeum, midnight approach, crumpled invitation) land by ~100 words. Cost is visible: he leaves the invitation as "unsigned admission of his own folly," foreclosing the isolationist stance. One tightening suffices at this length. The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via realization + symbolic act) lands cleanly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through decay imagery, gardening attempts, and the encounter, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the patrolman's nod and departure reconfigure the courtyard from policed space to shared memory without resolving Elara's larger project. The cost is legible: she remains alone, her rebellion unchanged but reweighted by being witnessed. One meaningful deepening (the encounter) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Kaelen, Aethelburg Archive, "today's work") arrive by line six. The piece accumulates density through the resonator sequence, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kaelen's successful capture of the frequency and his stance as "curator of echoes" reconfigures the opening despair into purposeful endurance with visible cost (the slide becomes "inert," the city strangers). The final image ("pale disc…slow descent") reweights the opening motif of the cloud-sea, and the cost—another cycle in frozen solitude—is undeniable. One meaningful cadence shift (the nova flare into silence) narrows options and charges the closure. No causality breaks; all moves cohere under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal, with Elara's three failed attempts creating because/therefore linkage that narrows options and forces the final lie. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the pirate-market setting, Silas/Eva negotiation, and Elara's goal are all clear early. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Eva throws the fob, Elara gains the recording, and the lie itself is a moral price (she breaks trust to save it). The escalation tightens cleanly through each failure, and the final beat reweights the opening stake (sound of trust breaking becomes sound of a lie under pressure). The piece remains single-POV, single scene, one dominant stake—all within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory detail, carrier arrivals, and the aurora's response to build density toward a final image that reweights Elara's research question. Closure occurs on-page as a Conceptual Repricing—her equation-seeking quest shifts to "learning to read a map written in lightning and rain"—with felt cost (her skepticism "profoundly illuminated" and "given a new…scale"). The linkage coheres under the lens, though the final beat leans heavily on metaphoric summary rather than a concrete action or image that dramatizes the repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on-page: Elias opens the box via the painting-key insight, revealing not Anya's past work but tools for his future—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) that reweights his calling with felt cost (years of photorealistic bankruptcy, the crystallized readiness). The causal lens holds: his eidetic gift → patron success → hollow artistry → cave sanctuary → painting-diagram insight → lock solved → tools revealed. One meaningful tightening (the azure-rose-gold-violet sequence) narrows options and demonstrates agency. Orientation anchors are clear by the second paragraph. The cost is legible in "finally ready to paint not what he saw, but the light by which he saw it."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: map discovery → reconstruction → vault journey → seed choice. The closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (planting the seed) that forecloses his prior role as passive observer, and the final image carries conceptual cost (commitment to cultivate truth). The orientation is clean, establishing who/where/when early. One weakness: the weeks of map reconstruction compress causality into summary ("Days turned into weeks"), and the vault door's sudden appearance risks feeling convenient rather than fully earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the detailed construction process, then releases in the sculpture's performance and self-destruction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elian completes his guardian role at the cost of the vessel, and the final image of him searching the horizon reaffirms his purpose with the sculpture's vanishing as felt cost. One quibble: the wind's arrival feels situationally convenient (it "came" at the right moment) rather than causally earned by Elian's engineering choices, though the piece establishes he designed for this updraft.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (caretaker unit, desert rose farm, dome, magnetic shift timeframe). The piece follows a causal lens: opening the box → chaos seeps → miniaturization → dome breach → escape, with each beat motivated by prior choice. Closure is on-page—stepping out with the "miniaturized fear" in hand—and carries visible cost (leaving the perfect garden, entering the unfiltered real). One meaningful tightening occurs when the chaos resists compression and the protagonist locks onto Elara's counter-frequency to push harder.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors orientation cleanly (Elias, courtyard, dawn, locked mailbox) and maintains causal coherence: listening → fragments → locket-as-key → opening → Gable's wish revealed. The Drive Lens reads as Causal with a tightening when Elias reinterprets the locket's filigree as a functional key. Closure achieves a Decisive Change (mailbox opens, community shifts from anxiety to storytelling) with felt cost visible in Gable's absence and the community's need to honor her memory. However, the cost is more emotional backdrop than a price Elias pays; the "drill or listen" tension deflates quickly, and the resolution hinges on a convenient object-match rather than a protagonist trade-off, capping the band despite clean structure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly: sunken lab, Elara, her task. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear tightening when dance fails and she pivots to randomness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dice roll, her coded entry, and the lab's transformation create a before/after with felt cost—she relinquishes control her mother never could. The cost is conceptual and relational (liberating the ghost by accepting vulnerability), legible in the final fractal bloom and the "warmth that was no longer fragmented."

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Silas, docks, dusk, post-whale world). The piece follows a Causal lens: the whale's decay creates gravity pockets, Silas uses coffee-ground divination to locate one, the pressed flowers anchor Elara's "frequency," he reaches in and retrieves a memory fragment, then the pocket dissipates. One meaningful tightening occurs when he touches the pocket and recovers the picnic memory, narrowing his options from speculation to proof. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he gains hope and commits to reclaiming memories "one at a time," with the cost that full recovery remains distant and uncertain. The cost is legible in "only a single, brilliant fragment" and "the path ahead clearer." A persistent constraint—the fluctuating, ephemeral pockets—shapes his tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara maps silence, saturates the wing, sends energy along pathways, and the whispers fade—a single deepening wave rather than causal reversals. Closure reads as Earned Stasis (she remains, work done, secrets asleep) with the "fragile blanket" image. However, the cost is asserted ("until the world's whispers threatened to grow loud again") rather than shown as a forfeited option or visible price on the page, weakening the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the sugar-borrowing beat. The accumulative-textural lens coheres: tutorial sessions deepen Clara's fluency until the seal amplifies whispers and forces confrontation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Clara presses the seal into dirt, accepting custodianship with the cost of losing the comfortable fiction made explicit on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when curiosity "curdles into need," narrowing options and driving the rooftop scene.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and the causal lens holds: Elian's choice to press the shell → memory bleeds through → he archives it with cost. The closure lands on-page with a visible emotional and existential shift ("no longer haunted by a void, but completed by a memory"). One meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to "push harder" rather than sever the connection, narrowing options with felt cost. Minor: the quarantined-memory mechanism relies on told backstory rather than dramatized discovery, softening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. Closure unit: Decisive Change + Earned Stasis—Kaelen completes the alteration, the Covenant is unlocked with visible cost (trembling, peace), and he walks out having forged a treason that releases the kingdom. The because/therefore chain is clean: study → glyph discovery → precise execution → semantic void → freedom. Orientation anchors (Sanctuary, altar, aurora, Kaelen's task) land within the first ~80 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the thorn touches parchment and the binding shifts from "forever bound" to "bound until fulfilled," narrowing all future war obligation to philosophical impossibility. Cost is felt (trembling, peace settling) and conceptual (honorably void contract, generations released). The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraph and pursues an accumulative/textural lens: Lyra moves deeper, each echo clarifies the cosmic debt concept, and the final chamber crystallizes her purpose. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she shifts from asking "why" to singing completion for others—with felt cost in the acknowledgment of her mother's completeness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seashell's whispers merge with the nexus hum, reweighting her understanding. The causal chain is clean, though the crystal formation's exact match to her shell half feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers dream fragments that deepen into a coherent accusatory pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the boy's smile and the soul's release). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure lands with felt cost—the boy freed, the man's facade dissolved—though the "borrowed starlight" final beat edges toward thematic summary rather than concrete image. One meaningful deepening (scattered cameos → unified dream theater) satisfies the length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: density builds through layered imagery (tea ritual, firefly dance, moon paths) toward a charged Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). The whistle moment crystallizes options—he reaches out, the pattern persists, he accepts connection without mastery—and the final tool reframing reweights the opening stake with conceptual cost (effort is participation, not control). Closure lands on the page with felt cost: the protagonist's desire is answered by acceptance rather than success. One meaningful deepening (tea → fireflies → whistle → tool repricing) tightens the central question. Orientation is clean by ~80 words (parapet, net-mender, firefly season). No causality breaks; pattern pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Kaelen's investigation → reassembly → comprehension → application → discovery. Orientation anchors (orchard perimeter, research station, antenna) land cleanly within the first third. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the stillpoint is revealed through Kaelen's final intuitive step, replacing folklore with physical law while the orchard remains unchanged—the cost is conceptual (one more comfortable lie excavated) and the final image charges prior material. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen must intuit the missing step, narrowing options and raising the stakes of the discovery. The piece holds its lens through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal-leaning with accumulative texture; closure arrives as a Decisive Change (the storm parts, sun breaks through) with visible cost (he's "forever bound" to survival's grit). However, the lacquered chest's sudden opening and the map's arrival feel convenient—the lock yields to the storm without prior setup, introducing a solving element the protagonist did not earn. The because/therefore chain weakens at the climax when external coincidence (chest opens, map resolves the dilemma) substitutes for protagonist-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The accumulative/textural lens is evident: the poet moves from discovery to collection to performance, building density through layered sounds. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the music box "transfigured," not restored) with conceptual cost legible in "translated its ghost into the language of the now." The escalation is smooth but gentle—one meaningful deepening when he decides to compose a new song rather than repair—yet the cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements: the hostile frequency intrudes → Elara adapts through vibrational matching → the threat is neutralized. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse gallery, drift-ice marina, government-issue coat). The closure unit is a Decisive Change—silence replaces the invasive hum—with physical cost ("slumped," "trembling") legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frequencies lock "in a violent shriek that threatened to crack the very foundation," narrowing options to subsume-or-fail. The cost, while visible, leans heavily on embodied exhaustion rather than a consequential trade-off or foreclosed path, preventing entry into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Kaelen at window, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic viaduct visible. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early through celestial tracking and holds through the density increase at closure when the viaduct's hum vanishes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to victory): the patient revolution succeeds, impatience sculpted into "serene and terrible shape of victory," with the conceptual cost of generations of waiting made undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs when the scrying bowl trembles and the resonant frequency creates the vulnerability window.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The causal lens is inferred and held: Elias discovers evidence (scuff marks, notebook) that reframes Finch's death from accident to obsession-driven misstep, leading to his decision to write a complete report. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias refuses Fletcher's directive, documenting full context with visible professional cost, and the final image of him walking toward the surface with "fortified quiet" crystallizes his autonomy. The cost is felt but slightly oblique—we sense career risk without seeing Fletcher's reaction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, single scene, clean orientation by the opening bell-chime. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through the clockwork heart examination and breaks into the light-through-clouds image, which reweights Arthur's understanding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing): Arthur moves from "master repairman of broken men" to "guide, pointing out the cracks," with cost visible in his acknowledgment that his prior methods ("scripture, prayer, absolution") could not touch Thorne's despair. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Kaelen, gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, years of ritual). The story follows a causal lens: months of observation yield the "Grip" glyph, which motivates the wing redesign, which enables the climactic test. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the glider holds in mid-air, a new law proven, with the felt cost of isolation ("couldn't tell a soul") and the existential gamble visible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when he launches and falls, then pulls the actuator—options narrow, cost is legible. The inferred lens holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (who: Elara, Memory Keeper; where: AetherNet archive server; what: searching for Julian's deleted profile) land within the first two paragraphs. The causal lens dominates: the flickering "7" in the error log triggers pattern recognition → celestial coordinate hypothesis → password attempt → Void discovery → forwarding the whistleblower file. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael's unexpected presence forces the lie, raising the cost of continued pursuit. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Julian's testimony escapes the cage, Elara answers her driving question, and the act of forwarding irrevocably alters her relationship to her employer. The final image (physical patch, "cool against her skin") charges the closure by linking the Seraphim-7 symbol to the risk she just took. Minor lens wobble: the "sensed absence" and "echo of forgotten songs" introduce accumulative/textural coloring in the setup, but the middle and ending resolve under clear causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (lighthouse orchard, community accusation) by the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Kael's investigation yields visions that reframe the accusation, leading to a resolved standoff with visible cost (Mara's fear acknowledged, Jorn's secret effort revealed). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community exhales together, the first step toward repair—with felt relational cost. One deduction: the visions arrive conveniently complete without dramatized friction or failed attempts, slightly weakening earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern taught early (trawling = learning endings), culminating in the ice-calving sound that reweights the dominant stake with visible cost (the calm that settles, her work done). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): comprehension achieved, the final image crystallizes her stance with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening—sound as answer—suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered reflection anchored to present stimuli (pavilion light, wind, vine rows) until the closure reconfigures the burned letter from scar to "dark lace...boundary line." Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of the breakup) lands with felt cost: he accepts the relationship was "doomed by its very chemistry," a path foreclosed. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the final image reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story anchors who/where/when by the pavilion opening and follows a clear causal chain: distortion triggers departure, spiral unlocks the parapet, peripheral awareness activates the machine, consecration seals the echo. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kael completes his task and the echo is sheltered, foreclosing further debate with visible cost—his solitary labor and the world's ignorance of what he preserved. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (the ritual's steps build pressure), and it holds cleanly to the end. Cost is legible in the final image: the pavilion's voices continue, but the truth is now sealed away, inviolate yet hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring vines and photo-mosaic pattern signal density increase toward a final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~150 words. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final photograph completes the spiral and the vines reach the roof—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no on-page price forecloses a path for Elias. The sequence of returning seasons and added photos provides tightening via cadence, meeting the lens requirement, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion ("His puzzle was solved") without a visible trade-off or sacrifice that the reader can point to in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (curator, library, dawn, post-completion language world) land clearly within the first paragraph. The crystal discovery initiates pressure; weeks of listening deepen understanding through fractured sequences that reveal "the pattern of growth." Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: Elias's realization that language is "living, breathing chaos" rather than finished product reweights his life's work, and his choice to testify rather than publish represents visible cost (foreclosing academic legacy). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the RR/CR hybrid lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (junkyard prophet, walking to coast, fog sculpture garden). The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (rusting metal, magnetic tape, eroding stone) until the final circle-drawing moment crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—Silas shifts from trying to capture/possess the sound to becoming it, a stance change with felt cost (the loss of his life's singular goal). The cost is legible in "not just hearing...but was the sound" followed immediately by recession and the dissolving circle. One meaningful deepening through escalating forgetting that narrows his options, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the clock hand freezes at lunar zenith, creating "a beautiful, silent prison outside of time's grasp" with visible cost—no more seconds will pass. Causality is clean: spinning hand → gravitational feedback → Elias's lens solution anchors the moment. The cost is on-page and undeniable: permanence achieved at the price of future time. Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric/accumulative shading in the final image; the because/therefore chain holds and the ending reweights the opening quest.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors early (Eyrie, Mr. Aris, Elara's role) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: brewing tea, playing the record, layering sensory detail to reweight the "flawless goodbye" stake. Closure lands with cost—the reunion occurs, Mr. Aris dies holding the shard, and Elara's hymn succeeds—but the cost is more relational (Lena's decade of pain bridged) than a visible price Elara herself pays. The final image reconfigures prior material (the broken shard now "the key"), meeting RR standards, though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors WHO (Elara, rune scholar), WHERE (floating observatory), and WHEN (after reality-warping event) within the first paragraph. Closure arrives on-page as a Conceptual Repricing: the projection reveals that shadows fold inward rather than vanish, reweighting the central mystery with visible conceptual cost (the world's new grammar is learned). The linkage is accumulative—weeks of study → key alignment → projection → answer—with one meaningful deepening when the automaton's function activates. Cost is conceptual (relearning) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, one scene in the garden with brief opening contextualization; orientation anchors cleanly. Causal lens holds: the discovery of the tooth forces acknowledgment of a reality he dismissed, which drives the constellation-drawing closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where he maps his "beautiful, terrifying mistake" and accepts the fracture with conceptual cost (loss of his rational worldview). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth's "impossible" physicality forces the "clean break" his wife predicted. Cost is legible in "forgiving himself...would be the work of a lifetime" and the irreparable cleft in certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who: Elara, where: serpentine grotto, when: days of mist) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates density through repetitive polishing motions, memory fragments, and the gradual transformation of the sea glass, culminating in the moment twilight strikes and the glass begins to glow—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image crystallizes her achievement with undeniable pressure. Cost is oblique: the "hours bled into a single, focused moment" and her solitary work, but the final image lacks a felt price that forecloses a live option or imposes a visible trade-off on the page, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the drip pattern accumulates meaning across three weeks, culminating in Elara's proffering of the pendant as a crystallized moment of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by ~80 words). The closure offers visible conceptual cost—Elara relinquishes her own symbol of permanence to reframe Kaelen's self-perception—and the water/amber contrast reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening (pattern recognition → symbolic gesture) is sufficient for this length, though Kaelen's arc could have shown more active resistance to raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraphs; timeframe is metaphorical but legible. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spectral cameos layer regret until the burial act reweights Elias's stance from author to keeper. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—he renounces resurrection and the pressure eases, signaling release. Cost is felt in the sacrifice of the shell and the quiet clarity replacing despair. The lens holds, though the middle section's parade of cameos risks static accumulation without a clear tightening choice until the burial.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves through discovery (song assembly from fragments) to enactment (vine weaving golden stories) to a Resonant Reconfiguration—the arbor now saturated with recovered memories, the village's "most important clock" reset. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost: Elian must now teach the song to others, a path "illuminated" but not yet traveled. Orientation anchors early (verdant arbor, pre-dawn, harvest moon). The ending's cadence shift ("deeper silence...but a full one") reweights the opening hush with accumulated meaning, though the felt cost of his own transformation or forfeit remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is prompt: orchard, crater, Kaelen by paragraph one. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers sensory detail and ritual steps toward a final Conceptual Repricing—the map blooms in the child's mind, reweighting the opening premise of "moving stillness" into actionable hope. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (Kaelen's stillness poured into the paper, his unending vigil). Minor deduction: the child's reception is told, not dramatized, softening the felt cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase through iterative observation culminating in understanding). Closure lands on-page with the mechanism humming and echoes blooming, but the cost is conceptual only—Elian's season-long labor is summarized rather than shown as a felt sacrifice that forecloses another path. The "preserved in the vault of his reason, waiting for the day the world was ready" line gestures toward thematic repricing but remains abstract; no concrete choice or visible price anchors the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (fractal weaver, bronze grotto, after first snowmelt) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the burden arrives, is transformed via starlight focus, and joins the mosaic—a clear RR (Earned Stasis) with conceptual cost (the shingled hush deepens, Kaelen remains kneeling). The cost is legible in the final image ("lonely warden…listening…waiting"), though the reconfiguration is subtle. Single continuous scene with clean causality under the inferred lens. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity. The closure qualifies but lacks a sharper pivot or felt loss that would elevate into high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (who: Elara, where: skylight loft, when: rainy evening, what: widow managing grief). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through memory, sensory layering (kettle hiss, ash scent, rain), and the carving act. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the first cut crystallizes intent and the final image—mug and scarred wood held together—reweights prior material with conceptual cost (grief contained but not erased). One meaningful deepening occurs when the memory shifts from pain to lesson, narrowing Elara's emotional trajectory. Lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (integration, not exorcism) with felt cost: Kael shifts from bargaining to bearing witness, his "purpose had shifted." The causal lens holds: camera wheel → memory → confession → acceptance alters his stance on the page. Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph (Precipice Platform, kinetic lagoon, post-halt timeframe). One meaningful deepening tightens the dominant stake (negotiation with ghost becomes self-acceptance). Minor wobble: "chronological confusion...settled" tells the shift rather than showing perception change through a concrete sensory or action beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara achieves activation and experiences wonder while beginning new calculations, crystallizing her philosophical search into actionable engineering. The cost is legible—she has spent hours of work, bypassed safety protocols, and committed to documenting rather than demolishing. Causal lens holds throughout: sextant discovery → schematic investigation → power rerouting → activation. One tightening occurs when she shifts from vague hope-seeking to concrete problem-solving after finding the sextant.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure unit is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias's act of placing the bells in the forecourt and leaving them transforms his relationship to the dream with visible cost ("leaving the silver constellation… his hands empty"). The accumulative/textural lens holds—petrichor, dripping water, and nascent sunlight build density that breaks into the golden ray moment, reweighting the hush from tomb to "foundational stone." Orientation anchors (clock scribe, sanctuary, pre-dawn) appear promptly. One small elision: the coffer's origin and the dream's abandonment are told rather than dramatized, but the present ritual earns the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Kael, twilight barge canal, pursuing a family legend with a tactile salvage method. The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative accents—each cast of the grappling hook tightens suspense, and the lockbox revelation decisively changes Kael's knowledge and reclaims his grandfather's name. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final understanding that "you couldn't read the time in the dark, but you could understand its function" reweights the sundial riddle and the grandfather's sacrifice with undeniable conceptual cost. The radio silence marking dawn provides a clean temporal bracket that charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered description and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the knot's cartography is decoded, preserving the secret weavers' philosophy. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the labor, the fog vigil, the meticulous transcription), and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is clean. One meaningful deepening occurs when the knot shifts from puzzle to "phrase" and "map," narrowing Elias's interpretive options and charging the preservation act.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (character, garden, island isolation anchored in the first paragraph). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Kaelen's projection deepens from thread-handling to immersive vision to thematic insight, culminating in the writing act that reweights "explained absences" as triumphant navigation rather than loss. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final image reconfigures healing as containment rather than erasure, with the conceptual cost legible in Elara's self-exile and Kaelen's solitary companionship. One friction: the projection is recounted as a continuous visionary sequence with no on-page resistance or complication that tightens options; the reader moves smoothly from thread to loom to carpet completion without a meaningful turn or micro-reversal within the vision itself.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and follows a clear causal-accumulative hybrid: Kaelen's assembly work → incubation → hatching → song → world response. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new hybrid creature's song forces the mechanical world to pause, and Kaelen's acceptance of this "new and uncertain dawn" forecloses his dream of pure organic beauty with visible emotional cost ("not the one he had dreamed of"). The inferred lens holds, and the cost is legible on the page in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from lagoon → fire → graft → return through density increase and charged callbacks. Orientation anchors cleanly (firefighter, lagoon, radio call). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of black sand "not just a symbol of fire's end, but a promise" reweights the opening motif with conceptual cost (the coin is gone, the symbolic inheritance severed). One meaningful deepening occurs when she snaps the coin thread, foreclosing her past. Cost is legible in the coin's burial and the thread's repurposing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent (cosmic alignment forces the window). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise variant—where the sigil resolves and the city exhales; cost is conceptual (years of waiting, the narrow window) and felt in the geese's departure marking her own conclusion. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The breadcrumb progression (tapestry, tile, pedestal discoloration) builds density and the star's passage tightens the moment, but the middle stretch leans descriptive rather than escalating pressure through new obstacles or choices. The click and whisper of water land as closure, though the cost could be more urgent on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who: Xylar; where: nebula garden; when: eons-spanning pilgrimage) land within the first paragraph. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through empathic sonar echoes, the discovery of the gear, and the reweighted insight at closure. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Conceptual Repricing): Xylar's sonar shifts from mapping to broadcasting, reweighting "light" from resource to emission. Cost is conceptual—renouncing the ancestor's calculative path—but the on-page felt cost to Xylar's people or tactics remains implicit rather than viscerally dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through nightly repetition and migration imagery building toward a pattern-break realization. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (Elias, greenhouse, dusk, butterfly season). Closure arrives on-page as Conceptual Repricing: collective grief reweighted from monument to network, crystallized in the abstract web carving. Cost is conceptual and felt (eased pressure, quieted thundering) but the final act—leaving the slate and returning with "new understanding"—reads as resolution without visible forfeiture or path foreclosed with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraphs (clock winder, belfry, anniversary ritual). The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ritual builds through layered sensory and memorial detail toward the imagined release that reweights the town's burden. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias continues the ritual with "profound lightness" and the clock's cadence smooths, signaling an incremental absolution with felt cost (the yearly penance, the letting-go struggle). Cost is legible in "the work of absolution was never finished" and the burden "correctly shouldered." One meaningful deepening occurs when he enacts the imagined release over the water, narrowing his containment impulse and affirming continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the tapestry-decoding ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sovereign case shifts from desperate echo to peaceful marker). Orientation anchors promptly (cemetery gardener, silo, twilight). The closure—reuniting case and map on the shelf—lands with conceptual cost (a future never arrived), though the cost is more told than felt in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frayed silver thread snaps the pattern into focus, reweighting the entire mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: obsidian spire summit, frozen lake, Ignorance Cartographer title by paragraph one. The piece operates under a Situational lens with Accumulative texture: pressure builds through modeling work, constraint acknowledgment, and the weight of the blank vellum until the final Charged Poise moment—quill poised, choice crystallized, cost felt (condemning old ways, forcing hardship). The descent in the final line provides closure via Resonant Reconfiguration: options are reconfigured and the transformation begins with visible agency and undeniable pressure, even though the pen hasn't yet marked the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear causal lens: Elias transcribes forbidden lyrics in luminous ink, then verifies the words under shortwave glow, preparing to smuggle them into the symphony archive. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Elias places the score with the stack, the cycle will continue, and the cost is the ongoing isolation and fear he accepts. The final image of "dust" learning stories provides conceptual repricing that reweights the opening devotion, though the lack of a live on-page pressure point or reversal slightly limits the felt immediacy of cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through ritual beats (portfolio → mask → kiln → rocking chair) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stillness crystallizes Kael's fleeting peace with visible cost ("grief would find its way back in"). Orientation is prompt: gallery, Elara, new client. The accumulative pattern is legible and the closure reweights the mirage-of-safety premise. One minor slip: the mask's artist's suicide is a told setup that never constrains a present choice, weakening the causal chain slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who: Silas; where: sewer grand gallery; when: post-plague generation). The piece follows a situational lens: pressure accumulates through the girl's arrival and her dismissal of the cog as "ghost-sickness," crystallizing Silas's stance in the final beat. Closure is Earned Stasis—he resigns to be "the world's memory" rather than teacher, placing the cog in the velvet box with visible opportunity cost (the seed of truth goes unplanted). One meaningful deepening occurs when the girl's rejection reweights his mission from hopeful to resigned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the choir achieves fragile unity, Elias moves from resigned to expectant, and the cost is visible—two years of struggle, tonight's failure, and the acknowledgment that the harmony is "imperfect, wavering." The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through the library reflection and the breath-to-hum progression. Orientation is swift (velvet library, autumn, Elias with rosette). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias shifts from forcing blend to subtracting noise, narrowing his method and enabling the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Elias, rusted greenhouse, celestial alignment window. The piece operates under a Causal lens with Accumulative texture: the pruning choices directly reshape the plant's trajectory, and the final fruit/leaf delivers a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing—history redeemed through deliberate surgery. Cost is legible in the irreversible edits and the weight of "his work had just begun," foreclosing simpler closure. One meaningful tightening occurs as frantic growth subsides into elegant structure, narrowing options to the pearlescent fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena walks away transformed from inspector to advocate, the lacquer box remains closed, and Silas's purpose is crystallized with felt cost (he has planted a seed but relinquished control of its outcome). The inferred lens is Hybrid-Causal-to-Accumulative: the riddle functions causally (narrows Lena's options and forces engagement), and the final image reweights prior material through the unopened box and the tower's lightning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena solves the riddle and grasps the bio-mechanical truth, narrowing her options from blame-hunting to cultural restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors promptly: Elara, bay, dawn/twilight. The piece follows a two-shard structure (night placement, next evening observation) within a continuous timeframe, resolving to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): her realization reweights her prior actions from animist ritual to social catalyst. The causal chain is clean: her displaced objects → occupants pause → behavioral change, with visible cost (she stops sanctifying, accepts her role as "purveyor of tiny questions"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a causal backbone; the ending crystallizes the pattern with cost (she loses her original mystical frame but gains agency as catalyst). One meaningful tightening is present and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Mara buries the ampoule and her certainty, foreclosing her mission path on the page. Causal lens holds throughout—each revelation (sanctuary not tomb, gill not flaw, poison not purifier) narrows her options until burial becomes inevitable. Orientation is swift: underwater city, living statue, mission context by paragraph two. One small deduction: the "cascading revelations" arrive in a compressed sequence that reads more like unpacking than discovering; spacing one revelation earlier would have allowed a mid-story pressure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the staircase shifts from prison to canvas with felt cost ("fresh wound in his soul"). The rupture beat delivers visible cost through sensory particulars (rain, lock, unspoken words) and the sealing re-establishes boundlessness with reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the proof completes and forces the paradox; the cost at closure is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—six nights of painting build density, then the seventh crystallizes into a broadcast and response. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lights answering reweights all prior solitary work, proving dormant memory with visible cost (742 sleepless nights, nervous energy, the risk of being "just a fool"). Orientation is clear by the greenhouse opening. One meaningful deepening occurs when doubt threatens to swallow the symbols, then reverses with the first responsive light. Cost is legible in Elias's sustained effort and the gamble itself.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece holds a causal lens: Alistair observes ice fractures, recalls sonic resonance from museum archives, proposes communal singing, and the waterfall thaws. The closure—a Decisive Change with auditory and visual proof of survival—lands on the page with felt cost (the gamble, the communal effort). Orientation anchors quickly (grotto, frozen waterfall, Alistair's role). One meaningful tightening occurs when the bread sparks the archive memory, narrowing options to song. The cost is visible (collective vulnerability during the attempt) but the leap from "texts describing sonic resonance" to "our anthems will work" compresses causality, and the success feels somewhat convenient given the lack of trial-and-error or setback within the singing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a clear causal chain: discovery of the yoyo mechanism → construction of the chronometer → initiation → temporal reversal, all motivated by Elias's stated desire. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (the "shimmering, terrifying potential of an unwritten past") and the lens reads as Causal throughout. The cost is legible in the final image—"the weight of every choice… being lifted, unspooled"—though the before/after could be sharper in terms of what specific path has been foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (funhouse, post-resuscitation, first-person) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Causal: advisor's notes guide navigation, the clasp becomes bait, Fear's misreading of the void springs the trap. Closure is a Decisive Change—Fear dissolves, the protagonist reframes the curse as weapon—with conceptual cost legible in "a truer, more perfect emptiness." One meaningful tightening (baiting Fear) leads to reversal. The final image reconfigures prior material cleanly under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal lens holds: cloud observation → charcoal mapping → mallet strikes → storm transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the storm's energy accepted and transformed), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical sacrifice made. Orientation is clear early; escalation is present but smooth, lacking a reversal that narrows options with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, stakes by ~100 words). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: Kaelen's decoding efforts narrow options beat by beat, and the whistle's crack triggers the watcher projection—a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the map reveals ordained extinction, reweighting all prior material, and the cost (his mother's likely death, the city's doom, his new impossible task) is felt on the page in the final lines. One meaningful tightening (the sonic syntax breakthrough) deepens stakes decisively. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The dominant stake—whether Elara will yield the document—is signaled early and resolved on-page when she slides the vellum across. Causality is present: Aris's historical parallel persuades Elara, she unfastens the case. However, the persuasion unfolds as exposition rather than pressure; the Ashworth Collapse analogy is delivered in uninterrupted blocks without Elara resisting, questioning, or complicating. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (document handed over) but cost remains abstract—"difficult work...yet to come" tells rather than shows forfeiture or consequence in the final image. Drive lens reads Causal but the because/therefore linkage is thin at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (surveyor, marsh, drawbridge night). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through layered ritual (cataloging land loss, placing notes, guarding memories) and tightens decisively when the inkwell nearly drowns. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias reaffirms his solitary purpose with renewed "fierce tenderness," forecloses alternatives, and the cost (isolation, scraped flesh, devotion to the drowned) is legible in the final image of meticulous cleaning and "quiet, unshakeable purpose." One meaningful deepening present; the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias's discovery of theft reframes the Athenaeum's origin, and his choice to pursue correction rather than announcement forecloses the path of immediate revelation with felt cost (solitary labor, no public vindication). The causal lens holds cleanly: blackout → access to forgotten objects → stamp match → decision. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~90 words. One meaningful tightening (the stamp match) narrows his options and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (workshop, floating isles, mnemonic gem). The pilgrimage structure coheres through spatial ascent and memory deepening; the basilica scene lands Resonant Reconfiguration (grief transforms from drowning sea to navigable current) with felt cost—the promise forever broken. One meaningful tightening: gem polishing across the climb reweights raw memory into bearable form. Closure is on-page and legible under the accumulative lens, though the final crane fold feels like a coda rather than the climactic reweighting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with a Charged Poise closure: the discovery of the resonance signature reconfigures her hunt from open wound to targeted trajectory, and the cost (grief remains "a cold, dense star") is legible. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The escalation—pushing the array beyond specs, circuit breaker trip, data window—narrows options cleanly. One persistent slip: the bracketed "[intricately tangible a force as gravity" is an on-page typo/artifact that disrupts the final third's causality slightly but does not break the closure unit itself.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with clear because/therefore linkage: pilgrim leaves chip → Elara slots it → overlay appears → she follows the path → pulls handle → lens focuses light → symbols appear. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence. The closure is a Decisive Change with Elara achieving her goal, but the cost is entirely offstage—no visible trade-off, sacrifice, or foreclosed path appears on the page. The phrase "missing pieces locked into a perfect, breathtaking whole" tells the resolution rather than showing what she now understands or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat. The closure—Elias's shift from guilt to purposeful reconstruction—lands on the page with visible cost (he must now painstakingly rebuild what was erased, starting with her family). The causal lens holds: discovery of the structured absence drives his new mission. One meaningful tightening occurs when the driftwood reveals the void, narrowing his options to active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Elias, Watcher's Spire, waxing gibbous timing). The dominant stake—successful exchange under archaic protocol—tightens through the lockbox sequence and pays off when chains fall; the closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "wisdom had cast a brief, hopeful light" with the lion still warm, foreclosing one cycle of regret with felt but not yet paid cost. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (moon phases, mist, lion recurrence); linkage is clean and ellipsis motivated. One structural seam: the backstory of the lion's "tragic and well-documented history" is told rather than dramatized, lowering immediacy slightly but not breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered regret, sensory detail, and the compass motif, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elias holds the compass over the water, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: he's spent a year walking away, and this stance forecloses further flight. The piece teaches its reflective mode early and sustains coherence through the final image, which reweights all prior flight.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: classifieds → coordinates → cavern → letter → spark of empathy. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist shifts from uncovering the past to building the future), and the cost is legible in the renunciation of backward-seeking. However, the Orientation Test reveals delayed grounding—who, where, and when are not anchored until after the procedure backstory, pushing clarity past ~120 words. The escalation is present but modest: one meaningful tightening (the letter's revelation) suffices, yet the journey itself feels more transit than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation early (who, where, post-phoenix timeframe) and follows an accumulative/textural lens: ritual deepens through scent-memory until the bond snaps into place. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (reforged bond), but the cost is implied through transformation rather than dramatized as a felt sacrifice—no on-page moment shows what Elian forfeits by becoming part of the orchard's "eternal, steady glow." The fortune cookie's directive ("reforged, not resurrected") provides thematic architecture but doesn't constrain tactics; the ritual proceeds without setback or meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara abandons the foolish question and vows to create new moments, forecloses the search with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds—phosphorescent moss, star-dusted clouds, and the saucer accumulate meaning that reweights at the cloak-drop and hand-tracing beats. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the family-custom failure drives her to the glade, and the final hand-tracing reverses that smudge with a vow. The cost is legible in the cloak release and the shift from seeker to creator, though the turn from anxiety to calm compresses quickly without intermediate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—photograph by photograph, stitch by stitch—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the aperture opens and Elara drifts toward it. Cost is legible: the photographs glow with "unified light," the dimension opens, and her "purpose fulfilled" state forecloses all prior vigil options. Orientation anchors quickly (Scrap-Ark, sole steward, command deck). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final photograph—her own childhood image—imposes the greatest weight before the ultimate lightness, tightening the emotional and thematic stakes in a way that reweights all prior work.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the piece follows a single continuous scene with a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the closure unit—Kael feeling the mountain's new heartbeat—relies on externalized transformation (the volcano's sigh, the steam) rather than an on-page decision or renunciation by Kael himself. The final image recharges prior material (fireflies, volcano, prophecy), but the cost to Kael is conceptual rather than felt: he sought transformation and witnessed it, yet no visible or emotional price is paid on the page. The prophecy fulfillment happens to him, not because of a choice that narrows his options.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors—vigilant sentinel, luminous fort, blackout—land cleanly within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Causal: Kael's bronze-quill-holder unlock sends signals that trigger off-page allies to act, a because/therefore chain. Closure is a Decisive Change (the fort's control shifts to conspirators) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: the old guard shouts "unaware their authority had just been dismantled." One meaningful tightening occurs when the chime resonates and the light-pattern shifts. However, the cost remains largely told rather than felt—Kael smiles in satisfaction with no on-page forfeit or visible personal price, and the revolution's success unfolds via summary rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph and establishes a causal lens: vision → placement of star dust → tide diverted. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the star dust is spent, Elara's "last resort" now used). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision forces Kael to escalate from passive pattern-laying to active harnessing. The cost is legible: he has expended an irreplaceable resource and altered his relationship to his work, moving from observation to intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: the sealed envelope's contents (key + negative) trigger a Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts the vigil from passive understanding to active journey ("His vigil in pause was over"). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—storm imagery, darkroom metaphors, and rarefaction language build to a cadence shift when the timer pings and the mask dissolves. Cost is conceptual (he must "develop" the scars, face them) and legible in the final image of the distant city light as promise and threat. One meaningful deepening occurs; no causality breaks. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through coded detail (sundial, needle card, shadow) and lands a Decisive Change when the compartment opens, revealing the scroll. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure reweights the waiting into a starting point with felt cost (the wait is over, the real journey begins), though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—Kaelen's tactics shift but no path is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly (moon, library ruins, Silas). Pressure accumulates through the arrival of the books, the coffee-tin reveal, and finally the two strangers—each beat reweights the stakes from solitary penance to nascent community. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "four people began the impossible, beautiful work" crystallizes the shift from isolation to collective action, and the cost (vulnerability, exposure to strangers) is felt in Silas's held breath and step forward. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drive lens is Causal throughout: compasses fail → film-reel map discovered → sonic translation attempted → threshold opens. Orientation anchors quickly (station pianist, tidal arbor, twilight deadline). Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: he steps through, abandoning the piano and arbor with a promise that "its hands would move again." The cost is legible in the renunciation of his post and the physical departure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the music creates the doorway, narrowing options to this single chance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece establishes clear orientation (who, where, when) within the opening paragraph and maintains a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Escalation proceeds through a meaningful tightening: disparate dream symbols cohere into a unified instruction, narrowing Elara's options to one faith-based act. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise—the seed's "quiet click" and memory reweaving—with felt cost (doubt persists, transformed but not erased). The monsoon deadline and the act of planting/singing create a before/after legible under the chosen lens, though the cost remains slightly oblique rather than sharply painful.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and pattern accumulate toward a final RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the compass ritual and lace instructions pay off in the granite-bluff beat. Closure lands on the page—the compass steadies, guilt diffuses, Kenji returns altered—but the cost is atmospheric (warmth, diffusion) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off. Orientation is clear early; the structure is a two-shard sequence (cottage interior → bluff → cottage return) within one window, meeting scope defaults.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change—Elias's memory loss—and cost is legible in the final image. The inferred hybrid lens (dominantly causal) holds, with the maze's geometry as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change under the Causal lens: Elara's activation of defenses buys time for allies, with cost legible in her chained state and the "beautiful noise of her victory." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the arrow-to-keys sequence tightens causality without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    Orientation is clear within 120 words, establishing Elias in the sunken orchard greenhouse. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation builds through sensory density leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure: Elias realizes he captured the absence of pain, reconfiguring his view of shipwrecks as survival monuments. Cost is legible in the final image where silence contains the pain, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Drive lens is causal, with tight because/therefore linkages: flower code changes venue, leading to heist and conceptual repricing. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Silas's role shifts from thief to custodian, with cost legible in "the portraits lining the walls seemed flat." Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Plot coheres under an accumulative/textural lens, with clear orientation early. Closure is a charged poise—abandoning the sphere reconfigures her emotional state with felt cost ("a weighty lightness"). The lens holds, and the structural failure escalates pressure meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from betrayal to decryption and outwitting. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost (Julian's terror, Leo's empowerment), anchored early in orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with cost as the star dissolves and the wind softens, forming a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate, and the structure coheres in a single scene with a meaningful deepening. The persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the "dying embers" imagery and sated obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (loop broken, memory gained) under a causal lens; orientation is immediate, and structure tightens through the violin's role as a temporal node, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as they stand together freed by honesty, with felt cost in Lena's tear and the thaw. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through symbolic tickets. Orientation is clear early, and causality is strong, with the eavesdropping leading to revelation. Persistent constraint of silence shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (butterflies validating Elias's methods) and resonant reconfiguration (marble crack), with felt cost under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. Persistent constraints (low luck score, past deception) shape tactics and the final image, ensuring cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal drive lens holds from Aris's request to the lever pull and hologram reveal. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost in Elias's "re-calibrated" understanding. Orientation is clear early; the nexus experiment tightens options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with a decisive change as Elias discovers the music, under a causal lens that holds throughout. The cost is legible on-page with the program's destruction and the ghost's peace. Orientation is clear early, and the structure coheres with one meaningful tightening driven by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Under the accumulative/textural lens, the structure builds through sensory details and reflection to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. Closure lands with cost in the "clean, high-altitude ache," and the smudged note acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (valve closure) with felt cost ("the weight in my gut hadn't disappeared... I had found the measure"). Orientation is clear early, and structure coheres without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the temporary peace and anticipated return to duty. The accumulative drive lens holds, with pressure building from absorbed histories to the escape. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the origami swan's use is a coherent turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lena's perspective shifts, linking loss to love with felt cost in her emotional transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the eclipse and music deepening emotional stakes. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the structure coheres in a single scene. No causality breaks; the eclipse timing serves as a purposeful catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as Kaelen unites diary and tapestry, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost; accumulative lens holds via diary revelations, and orientation is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with cost as Kael feels the mountain's steady heartbeat, a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative/textural lens. The detour pivots on character choice, and the prophecy fulfillment is integrated without exposition. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (authority dismantled silently), under a causal lens that holds throughout. Orientation is clear early, and the sundial mechanism is set up and paid off cleanly, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Plot is causal with clear orientation early: who (Kael), where (tidal bluff), when (night under aurora). Closure is a decisive change—he diverts the tide using star dust—with felt cost in his exhaustion. The inferred causal lens holds without ambiguity, and the promise constraint shapes tactics. No teleporting props or outline sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a decisive change from vigil to action, with the key and negative reconfiguring options under a causal lens. The cost is legible in the "new, terrifying journey" and the receding storm. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity, reinforced by the timer's payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands with a decisive change (scroll reveal) under a causal lens, driven by Kaelen's actions. The sundial and needle card create persistent constraints that shape tactics, though cost is more logical than emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the arrival of drifters, reconfiguring hope and community under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and cost is legible in Silas's invitation. The lens holds without ambiguity, but the escalation is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Elian leaves his piano and clock behind, promising movement. Causal lens holds strong from compass failure to music-forged doorway. Orientation is clear early, and persistent time constraint shapes tactics effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—the pulse resonating in her bones and the memory reweaving—under a consistent Causal lens. The persistent constraint of her doubt shapes tactics, and the orientation is clear within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost as guilt softens, under an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the compass's role tightens causality toward the climax without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: flood → observation through the pane → discovery of the lens effect → orchid/weed realization → reorientation and choice to act. Causality is tight under a textural lens, with each return visit deepening his stance until the orchid scene snaps the pattern into a decisive change. Closure is strong and concrete (wiping the pane, looking for the shovel) with clear before/after contrast and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain (fire → ruin and withdrawal → discovery of ledger → realization about frost maps → tracking to the cave → transformed use of kiln) is clean and legible. The piece maintains one POV and a coherent temporal flow, with reflection anchored in concrete present stimuli (ruins, frost, canyon). Closure lands clearly as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration when she chooses to reengage with her craft under a new understanding. Stakes are modest but appropriate to the length and mode, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present-tense experiment → intrusion of past trauma → reweaving into a new configuration, with a clear before/after in her relationship to silence. Causality is accumulative/textural rather than event-driven, but each step follows coherently from the last (focus on flower → colors intensify → trauma overwhelms → deliberate weaving). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s silence is conceptually repriced in the last paragraph. A slightly pat final summation (“The silence was not an ending…”) makes the resolution feel a touch explained rather than wholly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: package → realization of Olen-Thal → decision to go → occupation of impossible space → activation of the astrolabe → resolution of the distress signals. Orientation is strong early (undertaker on a pier, storm, underwater library) and the one major transition (pier → non-space → library) is legible. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: the world’s distress signals are rerouted, and Elias’s life-long problem is resolved with an emotionally legible cost. The main limitation is that the journey and solution unfold without real structural complication or reversal, so the arc feels slightly straightforward for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: sanctions → hunger → anonymous food → bell revelation → declaration → community garden → seeds/tools as approval. The story delivers a clear closure unit (RR with a touch of DC) as dependence on unseen charity is reconfigured into intergenerational self-sufficiency at the arbor. Structure is linear and coherent with no orientation debt; the bell’s introduction is a strong mid-story tightening. Cost is present but subtle (risk, labor, emotional exposure), which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: memory → pilgrimage → ritual → vision → conceptual reconfiguration, with clear because/therefore linkages. The accumulative pattern of breathing and image-shift steadily builds toward the realization about love being rewoven into the world, and the closure beat (her eased ache and new understanding) lands on the page with cost. There are no orientation issues, and the single-scene focus is well judged for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the fragment → retrocognitive trap → worsening unraveling → attempt to use the maze’s geometry → disintegration of the fragment → erasure of self. Orientation (who/where) is clear very early, and the hyperbolic maze framework is consistent and used at the climax. Closure is a decisive change with unmistakable cost: he moves from a man devoured by memory to someone with no past at all. The structure is tight for this length, with no stray set-ups that fail to pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: the wall falls, the arrow arrives with the code, Elara deciphers the keys, triggers the arcade defenses, and thereby delays the enforcers so allies can reach the vault. The scene holds one tight unit of time and place with no orientation issues and a clear dominant stake. Closure is strong as an earned stasis/charged poise: she cannot change her physical constraint, but the situation beyond her has been reconfigured at cost. The only slight softness is the convenient timing of the arrow, though it’s framed as the culmination of a long plan rather than pure coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: preparation → ritual → climax → quiet aftermath, with each move causally linked and easy to follow. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration as he shifts from chasing the sound of betrayal to accepting the silence of its bounded absence. The process of unsealing the jars and feeding the forge tightens the frame coherently under an accumulative drive. A sharper articulation of what failure would concretely mean for him (beyond continued pain) could heighten the sense of stakes at the structural level.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal line—coded flowers → change of target → Emerald Station encounter → reoriented life in the apartment—with a clear conceptual before/after. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he redefines his relationship to time and destiny through the jar. The cost and constraints of this new role remain largely implied rather than dramatized, which blunts the structural impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: Great Thaw → structural failure → urgency to complete the piece → forced abandonment and escape → emotional reconfiguration outside. The single main turn (choosing life and future over completing this artwork in this place) lands with on-page cost. Structure—a tense interior scene followed by a short exterior coda—supports a clear before/after without wasted motion. It’s strong and publishable, if relatively straightforward for elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: post-betrayal disorientation → shell-guided search → hidden cast → decoded cipher → discovery of Pier 7 plan → confrontation → deployment of failsafe. The structure adheres to a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory that remains anchored and advances present choices, and the constellation-based cipher is a plausible, motivated puzzle rather than a deus ex machina. Closure is decisive: Leo’s use of the emergency containment command both foils Julian’s escape and redefines Leo’s own status, with visible cost in risking his own containment. The only slight weakness is that the real-world implications of “emergency containment” for Leo’s continued existence remain a bit abstract, softening the sense of concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structurally clean: one continuous ritual scene with a clear arc from preparation through the star’s disappearance to the completed glyph. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres via deepening hush, storm, and the narrowing window as the last star fades. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: Kaelen has added one more map to an infinite chronicle, briefly sating his drive. The cost is mostly conceptual (a life narrowed to this ritual, the “infinite puzzle”), which works but could be more concretely dramatized to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: courtyard routine → anomalous violin → prior failed attempts → new amalgamation tactic → memory fragment → loop break all chain causally. The drive lens is largely causal with a conceptual reweighting at the end, and the closure (loop breaking plus gained fragment of self) lands clearly with a before/after. Exposition about the Second Chance Program and loop count is concise and supports the mechanics instead of derailing pressure. Cost is legible in the risk of system failure and the surrender to dissolution to gain a single, fragile thought.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: ritual ticket drops → growing need to understand → the monolith image directing him to the park → discovery → shared, wordless confession. The structure (lobby → reflection/ritual montage → park confrontation) is legible and makes the final scene feel earned. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration at the cenotaph, where their relationship’s terms visibly shift through his offering of the lens and tickets. There are no real orientation issues or causality breaks, though escalation remains deliberately quiet rather than sharply peaked.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: challenge → recollected foundation (fungal rot) → preparation via ritual → solstice evaluation → unexpected but thematically seeded butterfly resolution → coda. Causality is mostly tight, and the closure unit (the garden “choosing” him, then the cracked marble) lands with clear before/after. The butterfly arrival leans slightly on coincidence, but prior emphasis on ecological richness and bees makes it feel earned rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: Aris’s need → Elias’s calibration → time‑sensitive experiment → lever pull → observable lateral echo → Elias’s conceptual shift. The single scene is well-contained, with the planetary hush as an implicit clock and a crisp closure beat in Elias’s reweighted understanding of his life. Stakes are primarily conceptual and reputational rather than materially tested, so the middle doesn’t tighten as much as it might. Still, the closure functions as a solid Conceptual Repricing with legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: past weeks of futile attempts → present-night realization about the water → decisive experiment → revelation and quiet resolution. Causality is strong under a Causal/Accumulative lens; each step grows naturally from the last without contrivance. Closure is solid—a resonant reconfiguration where the drive moves from solving a puzzle to carrying a legacy, with the ghost’s peace as the cost marker. The stakes are modest and inward-facing, but the arc is complete and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: fever breaks → she approaches the avoided space → engages with the illustration and note → replays the smudge → arrives at a conceptual revaluation of what she’s been seeking. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the quiet internal turns escalate appropriately toward a clear closure beat (the decision not to read the word again and to reframe the “truth”). Causality is intact and legible, with no orientation issues. The piece is intentionally small in external scope, which keeps it from feeling structurally daring but suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal: confession → sound → investigation → recognition of blame → re-framing as a solvable problem → turning the valve → altered atmosphere and internal repricing. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the first paragraph, and the psychic-radio frame is taught early and paid off thematically at the climax. Closure lands decisively: the ghost shift stops, the room empties, and his relationship to his own secret is reweighted on the page. The cost—physical struggle and unresolved but bearable guilt—is legible in the final image of bone-deep exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: rising psychic pressure in the library → triggering Aeridor’s unbearable chronicle → decision to use the swan → transition → refuge and temporary restoration. Causality holds smoothly under an accumulative/textural lens, and the single major turn (choosing regenerative silence over continued endurance) is well prepared. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the keeper is temporarily renewed but bound to return, with the cost of this loop implicitly acknowledged. There are no orientation issues; the two-shard structure (library vs. river) is legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single, time-bound session whose arc is driven by the approaching and then receding eclipse. Causality is clear—Elias times the ritual to the light change; his music and guidance prompt Lena to open the box and then to “link” her memories. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she reframes the curl from pure loss to proof of love, with the eclipse’s end marking the new stasis. The cost (living with grief as awe rather than only pain) is legible, though lightly sketched rather than deeply dwelt in.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline—Kaelen in the silo, discovering and reading the diaries, reaching an interpretive resolution—is clean and easy to follow, with anchors established early. The structure is essentially one accumulating scene framed around the diaries and the tapestry, leading to a Conceptual Repricing of the tapestry and Elara’s act as “intellectual mercy.” Closure is solid: his quest is declared complete and his role redefined as “archivist of the ache,” clearly separating before/after. Escalation is mostly informational rather than situational, so the structural turn feels more like a deepening realization than a pressured pivot, keeping this below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the bell → microdot delivery → crafted fortunes → orchestrated meeting → successful exchange → personal reevaluation and departure. Orientation is quick and solid, and the drive lens (causal with lyric accumulation) holds through to closure. The ending provides a decisive change—he abandons his role—with a conceptual cost that is legible on the page. The main structural weakness is that the spy exchange proceeds so smoothly it risks reading as foregone rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: set-up of possession and time pressure, development through escalating rhetorical probing, and resolution when the entity’s axiom collapses. The scene is well oriented from the outset (who/where/what problem) and stays in one coherent window. Closure is decisive—entity gone, palette fallen, stakes resolved—and there is a clear conceptual repricing of “truth” and “gray.” The cost is more intellectual than visceral, so the ending feels elegant rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: preparation in the spire, cosmic alignment at dawn, the crisis of the missing connection, and a quiet but decisive closure when he finds the keynote and writes the fortune. Causality under a textural lens is coherent—orbital mechanics create the window, his years of work enable the final mapping, the keynote line resolves the ritual. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: his relationship to time and his own ache is clearly “before/after” with a cost in exhaustion and acceptance rather than victory. Stakes remain internal and conceptual, but they’re tightly held and never drift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal line—looped existence → reinterpretation of the tablet → recognition of the seed memory → deliberate re-entry into the origin point—holds and gives a solid Decisive Change (regaining gravity and wholeness). Orientation is clear early: who he is, where he is, and what the looped structure implies. The closure image (dawn, inert tablet, weight restored) lands with a legible before/after and conceptual cost (loss of buoyancy, acceptance of pain). Escalation is more internal than external but the structural turn on understanding the “algorithm” is clean and well-placed.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: brief orienting backstory, then one continuous scene with the performance as the spine and a clear before/after in how silence is experienced. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the rising vibrations and audience responses build toward a resonant reconfiguration where silence gains new meaning and shared warmth. Causality is simple but coherent—her method leads to a communal emotional breakthrough. The cost is quiet but legible in the years of numbness and labor culminating in this charged, changed stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: eerie pursuit → courtyard respite → pigeon arrival → impossible data → synthesis → tactical decision. The piece lands a clear closure beat in the decision to investigate via subterranean routes, a Charged Poise that defines the next phase and reconfigures his options. Stakes and prior elements (pursuers, quarantine, phantom storm) cohere into “a single, coherent system” without breaking plausibility. The main limitation is that the cost of this closure remains largely conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in the ending scene.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: his long avoidance → visit to greenhouse → UV method on vial → revelation of “Somniflora” → flower blooming → scent recognition → grief acceptance. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues, and the drive lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds through closure. Closure is solidly on-page: the decisive change is his choice to finally grieve and “breathe it all in,” with visible emotional cost. The structure is simple but well-shaped for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure: quiet setup, inciting offer from the Lumin, reflective interrogation, and a stance-taking closure. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens: his long-term observation enables the reinterpretation of the “choice,” which in turn produces the third-path decision. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—he refuses both paths but reframes existence as always both singular and collective, with the cost of continued mortal decline and solitude implied. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by a morning ritual and a charged night performance, with a single backstory shard (grandfather, bonfires) that directly informs her present tactic. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the progression from heavy quiet → remembered claim that music can “unbind” → experimental playing → greenhouse-as-instrument → water-drop closure is coherent and causal enough. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush is reconceived as something that can “be given a voice.” Stakes are modest but legible, and there are no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece presents a clean, causal single-scene structure: client request → preparation → transfer → extraction → cost, with no orientation or lens confusion. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: Kael’s understanding of the impossibility of rootless joy reweights the client’s request and his own role. The cost—keeping the sorrow—is explicit and binds the ending to the opening premise. The only thing keeping it short of the very top band is that the external situation stakes remain narrow and largely uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: mistaken letter → epistolary bond → meeting after a concert → revelation of David → Elias’s grant reveal as closure. The story uses a mostly single-scene structure with one integrated backstory block that clarifies stakes and directly motivates the present action. Closure lands as a decisive change in the social world (the grant exists) and a resonant reconfiguration between them, with emotional cost in Elias’s vulnerability and Alina’s reopened grief. The main limitation is that pressure never seriously threatens derailment, so the turn, while satisfying, feels safe.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: desire for belonging → opportunity of Echo’s tag → Kaelen’s distinctive search tactic → discovery and reframe of Echo → overnight labor → social recognition and new role. Structure is simple but effective, with one primary tightening when his quiet suggestion leads the group to the fissure and the arbor, concretely changing his status. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration—he reorients his life’s work—with an intelligible before/after. The stakes and cost are modest but coherent for the scope, and there are no orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: disrupted cadence → discovery of Chronovore and nests → approach to primary nest → pendant revelation → corrective action → restored rhythm and vanishing threat. The structure fits the length, focusing on one escalating situation and a single climactic intervention. Closure is solid—a decisive change in the world plus a conceptual reframing for Elias—but the resolution feels slightly unchallenged, as the pendant’s function appears just in time without serious resistance or cost. Still, there’s no orientation or lens confusion, and the ending lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene moves from setup (preparing the ritual) through execution (placing the eyes, channeling grief) to a resonant reconfiguration (the lattice and its aftermath). Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens—each magical step follows logically and reweights his internal state rather than introducing arbitrary turns. Closure is clear and on-page: the visualization and his calm recalibration of the loss mark a before/after with a felt emotional cost (accepting form instead of hoping for return). The only limit is the relative safety of the scene—no false steps or failed attempts complicate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: outage → destroyed archive → Elias’s scavenging → discovery of a uniquely charged fragment → decision to intervene → Anya’s discovery and emotional reversal. Structure is simple but effective: one continuous window with a brief but well-anchored explanation of his usual practices and Anya’s struggles to heighten the present choice. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR, with Elias recommitting to his hidden role after a successful, concrete intervention. The only limit is that the risk and cost of his choice remain low-key, so the final before/after shift, while satisfying, is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear and efficient: storm damage → failed repair attempt → observation of the leaf and vine behavior → reframed understanding → choice to reconstruct differently. The structure (morning struggle, later-afternoon realization and decision) is legible and scaled well to the length, with a decisive change at the end. Closure lands as a credible internal turn with a visible cost—abandoning the fantasy of restoring the old life—and a new tactic. The piece leans slightly toward reflection over on-page testing of the new stance, but not enough to undercut structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece tracks cleanly from insomnia → storm → following rain trails → discovery → encounter → exchange → return and reoriented painting, with no orientation slips. The causal chain is modest but solid, and the closure—a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration of Elias’s relationship to his work—lands clearly. Cost is legible in his relinquishing the brooch and accepting insomnia as a “quiet companion.” The structure is straightforward rather than daring, but it’s tight and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s arrival → disruption of the cave’s music and Lyra’s sight → escalation via shadow-images → threshold confrontation → reconfiguration at the Heartstone. Closure lands solidly as a decisive change in Lyra’s role and the cave’s relationship to the world, with a clear before/after. The drive lens is primarily causal with some accumulative texture, and it holds consistently. The main limitation is that external resistance is minimal—Kael never truly pushes back—so structural tension leans almost entirely on Lyra’s interior shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: shorecombing → discovery of the valve → later arrival of exiles → recognition and recontextualization of the object → reaffirmed purpose. Causality under an accumulative lens is solid, with the valve acting as the hinge that ties his abstract project to a concrete survivor. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the woman’s resolve and Kaelen’s purpose are both reweighted by that encounter. Stakes and cost are modest but legible, fitting the piece’s quiet scope.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: dare → following the pavement language → brick wall → ticket punch → fortress → revelation about the mentor → implied acceptance of the role. Orientation is strong; we know who/where/when very early, and the single transition via the punch is cleanly handled. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: he reframes the dare and the punch as a responsibility, not a mere key. The main limitation is that the route from problem to resolution is almost too smooth, with little structural complication or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: promise → investigation failure → storm-heightened whale song → recalled method → transcription → visions → reconfigured understanding. Time and place are anchored early and maintained; the squall is a clear inflection point that tightens the situation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he has completed her work and his stance toward her “cosmic echoes” is irrevocably altered, with emotional cost visible in his grief and newfound openness. The mechanics of how sound/light become “numeric language” are sketched rather than dramatized, but not enough to damage structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: storm arrives → he uses it to attack reality and the amulet → space “refuses” → rift appears → he chooses to cross. Orientation (who/where/when) is firm early, and the single-scene structure suits the length. Closure is decisive and on-page: he severs the amulet’s control and walks into a conceptual void, with the cost (possible annihilation) legible. The only limit keeping this out of the very top band is that some middle beats feel like descriptive plateau rather than active complication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: past harm → call for help → plan → execution → delayed confirmation. The prep-room scene, fake death procedures, and use of the Ghost chemical all track logically to the coda with the cycloid diagram, which delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure. Yet the most dangerous segment—the border crossing—is entirely off-page, so structural tension never quite peaks in-scene. The week-later envelope works, but because no option is visibly threatened midstream, the final confirmation feels a touch frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: dawn ritual → moment of intensified hum → capture → projected later transformation into paper. Causality is intact and legible, and the closure (she has “another fragment” against the void) is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, which fits the mode. The “later, in her workshop” shift is slightly summary-like but still clearly anchored and servicing the main line. Cost at closure (her narrowing life versus the work) is present but understated, which softens the impact somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the incoming tide brings new voices, layering builds toward the temporary coalescing of a “phantom history,” and the ship’s horn breaks the spell. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each added fragment intensifies the experiment with the poison label and culminates in a charged but transient memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator hasn’t solved their erasure, but their relationship to memory has deepened, and this stance is crystallized in the final commitment to “wait for the next tide.” The scene stays tightly framed in time and space with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story tracks cleanly as a single experimental attempt: Elias tunes the cello to decode Thorne’s “ephemeral compass,” the experiment peaks, then yields a reorienting realization. Causality is clear (frequency search → resonance → dust-line → terrestrial “scar” insight) and there is on-page closure via a conceptual repricing of what the observation meant. Stakes are largely intellectual and personal, so while the structure is solid, the sense of irreversible cost is more implied than sharply dramatized. Still, the before/after—skeptical seeker vs. inheritor of a vast, lonely riddle—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: threat of privatization → Kael’s strategic idea → implementation via graffiti → inspector’s confused assessment → Kael’s altered understanding at the edge of the city. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the inspector’s visit functions as a focused test of the plan. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: the world hasn’t been saved, but its story—and thus its options—have been irrevocably shifted, with the cost of ongoing uncertainty clear. The structure fits the length well, with no extraneous detours or unresolved setups.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: illicit mission → chemical lure → bloom → sunrise annihilation → quiet packing up, with no dropped set-ups. The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive, tightening toward the single irreversible moment when light arrives and the Silene Flora vanish. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: he has the photograph and the searing memory, but the organisms are gone forever and the cost is legible in his melancholy. It’s structurally sound and self-contained, though not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: damaged drone → diagnosis via basins → intricate repair → test and hand-off under a ticking clock. Orientation is excellent from the opening (who, where, when, what’s at stake) and the scene holds to one continuous through-line. Closure lands as a quiet earned stasis: the ship departs, the drone is functional, and Elara settles back into listening, with the “before/after” legible in the change from chaotic to concentric ripples. The cost is modest and mostly implied (time pressure, exertion), which keeps the effect strong but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean: we move from waiting → signal (falcon/pressure) → deciphering the phrase → manifestation of the frost-map → recognition of the phenomenon and role shift, all in one continuous scene. The accumulative drive (atmospheric conditions, cryptic clue, then visual revelation) coheres, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his life’s work. The causal line is mostly sound, though his leap from “map appears” to “re-alignment of world physics” leans on prior research rather than on-page testing or resistance. The ending hum and Lyra’s departure give a felt cadence, but there’s room for one more concrete consequence or constraint to sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure—archway → market circuit → return—reads cleanly under a textural drive lens, with each pass of footsteps thickening the revived soundscape. Closure is legible: the town’s resonance is meaningfully altered, and the final tuning-fork strike functions as a clear reconfiguration. Causality is intact and simple, with no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the abstract global stakes (“shared balance”) are never concretely tested or sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: descent with limited power → opening the vial → the hush’s unexpected memory-attack → a deliberate choice to endure and isolate one thread → success coupled with certain death. The single-scene structure is tight, with the oxygen countdown and power loss providing a clear narrowing of options. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she has irrevocably chosen the vial over escape and dies with that choice. The only minor limitation is some time dilation in how much intricate psychic work occurs in those “minutes,” though it doesn’t truly break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: arrival with inherited stigma → exploration of an impossible lighthouse → discovery of the frozen murder scene → decision to break it → anticipation of misreading by authorities. Causality is strong under a mostly causal lens: his desire for a story leads him to the hush, to peering through the confessional lattice, and finally to opening the door and collapsing the impossibility. Closure (a resonant reconfiguration) lands: the lighthouse shifts from imprisoning the hush to remembering the one who freed it, with a clear before/after and conceptual cost. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the brief time jump to the approaching launch is smooth and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear: bead → heightened hauntings → toxic flourishing → Night Phalaenopsis bloom → knowledge transference and Lyra’s release. The structure holds as a single accumulating arc with a clean before/after, and closure lands firmly with the transfer of ancient knowledge and the dissolution of the ghost bride. Cost is legible in Lyra’s final sacrifice and Elian’s solitude, and the debt frame ties beginning to end. The only limitation is that the outcome feels somewhat foregone, with little sense that events could plausibly break another way.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the plate → haunted sleep-weaving → emergence of other threads/community → looming storm → conscious reinforcement → post-storm reconfiguration of the tapestry as map and music. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a strong accumulative texture, and closure satisfies both: Kaelen’s decision to act awake decisively alters what the storm can and cannot erase. Cost is on the page (blood, fear of total erasure, frantic labor) and the before/after of the labyrinth’s meaning is legible. A minor limitation is that the mechanics of the collective sleepwalking remain suggestive rather than causally pressured in the climax, staying mostly as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: a present-time quest with a clear sequence—arrival, wandering, discovery of the sundial, excavation, and reinstallation—culminating in a conceptual revaluation of “interrupted” journeys. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens: her chosen method of wandering leads to the find, which leads to the reconstruction and final realization. Closure lands with a solid Conceptual Repricing when the ship carving reconfigures the supposed “tragic end” into a perpetual beginning, with emotional cost visible in the filling of her hollow faith. The piece stays within one temporal frame with brief, well-anchored backstory, so there’s no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    Structure is clean: we move from setup in the arcade to the chalk-coding outside, then to the physical letter and its implied dispatch, all causally coherent. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise moment—Kaelen commits to the analog plan and sends the identity out into the world. But the drive is mostly conceptual and textural; there’s no genuine complication or narrowing of options, so the arc feels more like a well-executed vignette than a full narrative turn with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: suspicions accumulate → she synthesizes them into a coup narrative → a narrow communication window appears → she acts to transmit the warning. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; we always know where we are and what the time pressure is. Closure lands as a charged poise: the message is sent with clear stakes and risk, and the final waiting stance feels earned and bounded by the coup clock. The only limit is that the external consequences are all off-page, so the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one ritual scene that moves from preparation to evocation to emotional fallout, with clear causal steps (shard → condensation → words → recognition). The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where Kael grasps *why* he chose fear over love, and Elara pays a physical cost—is fully on the page. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and it holds consistently to the end. The piece is intentionally quiet in turns, but nothing important is skipped or mechanically explained away.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from observation, to decoding the cast, to the charged confrontation with Varin. Causality is solid—Elias’s interpretations lead directly to the small but decisive softening in the General. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: father, daughter, and absent mother are reweighted in that final touch and the mist-clearing image. Stakes are modest but coherent and fully paid off at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is simple but sound: daydream entry → search and attempt → failure/instability → use of fragment as solution → return to waking frame with reweighted understanding. Causality is coherent and legible; each step (“too much focus will wash it out” → careful painting → still incomplete → use fragment) follows a clear because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the joy recovered only as a fleeting mural within a daydream, now held as a warm echo in waking life. Stakes remain intimate and internal, but the cost of ephemerality is clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: coin → first bewitching → iterative experiments → orchestrated sequence → return to scaffold. The nested awakenings are legible and escalate in a patterned, accumulative way, and the final return constitutes a clear conceptual repricing of his life and craft. The main limitation is that the stakes remain largely conceptual and safe; there’s no moment where failure or refusal would materially cost him more than an abstract opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: erased sunflower → recognition of escalating threat → greenhouse plan with the seed and orchid → activation → citywide psychic disruption. The structure—brief garden shard into the main greenhouse scene—fits the length and lands a clear Decisive Change plus reconfigured options at the end. Stakes and world rules around the Synaptic Census, floral syntax, and cognitive grid are legible without major exposition dumps. The only limitation is that the potentially colossal collateral cost of the plan is gestured at rather than structurally tested or complicated across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure follows a clear accumulative/lyric arc: endless insomnia and postcard-anchored longing → generational dissemination of her sorrow → subtle internal shift → decisive reconfiguration of the postcard’s role. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she remains insomniac and isolated but recasts her vigil from lack to creation, with the postcard ritually ensconced as the new heart of the shell. Causality is soft but coherent—each step grows logically from the prior emotional state and concrete object use, with no orientation debt. The main limitation is that the generational sailor frame is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping the plot more conceptual than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from approach, to preparation, to the delicate act of resonance, to the orchid’s lighting and the quiet aftermath. Causality is straightforward—he must capture the last embers of Simple Trust now or lose it forever—and each step follows logically from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchid is preserved at the cost of the world below losing the living feeling, and Elian is returned to his endless, costly duty. The piece could support a slightly sharper mid-scene tightening, but the single central turn is sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: estrangement → plan to use symphonies → preparation and modification → spell manifestation → Elara’s response, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise when she takes his hand, clearly reconfiguring their “paths diverge forever” premise. The risk of spell failure and self-destruction is well set up, giving the act real stakes, though nothing actively goes wrong during the casting to tighten pressure further. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with a coherent drive lens and no structural seams.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong and legible: envelope → forensic analysis → ciphered chain → hidden cache → letters → reinterpretation of the father. This is a clear Causal design with a satisfying Conceptual Repricing closure. The main soft spot is how effortlessly Kaelen performs highly specialized deductions with no resistance or false starts, which flattens some potential tension. Still, the single-scene structure is tight and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: calm ritual → exposition of grief and stakes → storm and leak as a concrete crisis → post-storm confession → next-morning gesture. Causality is tight: the leak threatens the sheet music, forcing embodied action and bringing Anna literally and figuratively under him, catalyzing the breakdown of his lies. Closure lands as a decisive change in behavior (telling the truth and sharing the “impossible”) with a clear before/after. No significant orientation or lens issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: analyzing the grain → recognizing the code → realizing the terrace is navigating fractured weather → forecasting threshold → deciding to cross. Structure as two linked shards (terrace, then void platform) is legible and supports a clear before/after. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost: he chooses permanent separation in exchange for understanding and agency. Some thematic explanation (“He understood the core concept that governed this place”) leans toward telling, slightly dulling the structural elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: setup of the failing facility and time constraint, Kaelen’s plan, the tense wait, and the spectacle that results in a clear internal/relational reconfiguration. Causality is intact and legible: his prior work with the energy grid leads to the light-jelly convergence, which in turn changes Elara’s stance and his sense of home. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal backbone and the closure (conceptual repricing of “home” and “belonging”) is firmly on the page. Stakes and time pressure (“until sunrise”) could bear more concrete influence on tactics; here they stay mostly atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → need to reconstruct → seeds/vines map → gap → time pressure → final conjecture → revelation. The drive lens is Causal with a conceptual twist at the end, and the closure is a clear conceptual repricing of “a path that disappeared” into “a chosen point of transformation.” Stakes for Kael (save the fading memory) are consistently tracked, though the traveler’s monumental cost remains off-page. Structure is tight and single-scene, with no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is meticulously constructed: tide → channel → machine vibration → coin cascade → projector flash → reflected beam → mural, with each step clearly motivated on the page. The global drive lens is Causal, and closure operates as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arcade’s monotony is briefly reweighted into wonder at real cost to Kael’s anonymity and effort. There are no orientation issues; the single-scene structure is clean and temporally coherent. A slight limitation is that the emotional consequence for anyone but Kael and the couple remains understated, so the cost is more conceptual than dramatically sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: attempt at ritual → failure → recalibration (focus on gaps) → transformative success, all in a single, continuous scene. Causality is legible and the accumulative, lyric drive holds throughout, with the final reconfiguration of his status as exile providing solid closure. The cost is more conceptual than visceral—the risk of defying the nostalgia ban is mostly implied rather than dramatized—so the ending lands more as revelation than as hard-won victory. Still, the before/after of his relationship to the cosmos and his own body is clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal and structural spine is clean: harbor → pond ritual → realization → return to atrium → reconfigured stance, with each step motivated and legible. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis with a clear before/after in his relationship to his work. Cost is present (he will let his decade-long masterpiece be reclaimed), though it’s conceptual rather than dramatically pressured. The piece might reach higher if there were a sharper on-page test—someone urging preservation, an immediate threat—that tightens the causal stakes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine (present ridge → past fire → reweighted present) is clean, with the porcelain box as a throughline. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when, and why they’re here are all legible early—and the embedded backstory is well anchored and purposeful. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kaelen’s new understanding and Elias’s reframed scars crystallize in the final quiet image. The structure is straightforward but very solid for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: Elara prepares the pattern, the tide activates it, the gauge responds, and she reads the outcome, with no orientation or logic gaps. The central drive—will this new pattern stabilize and lift the other reality’s vitality—is clear and escalates through the needle’s drop and recovery. Closure is solid: the needle’s higher, stable resting point and her turn to “the next, more ambitious pattern” mark a decisive before/after with conceptual cost (prior failures, risk of collapse) implied. The cost is more intellectual and cosmological than visceral, which keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous exploration that escalates from atmosphere → journals → film strip → conceptual realization. Causality holds, and the closure—her mapping “A burden of knowing” and leaving the ghosts undisturbed—registers as an earned stance. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and is maintained throughout. If anything, the story could sharpen the present-tense stakes of her decision to enhance the sense of consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single ritualized act framed by the bells, with cutaways to the city that clarify impact and then a precise closure when the chime breaks the spell. Causality is intact and legible under an accumulative/textural lens—light + song → altered reflections → residual emotional trace. Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and the cost is mostly conceptual (ephemerality) rather than sharply dramatized. The piece feels complete at this scale but not yet indispensable in its final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear before (they have not signed) and after (they have) and an on-page decisive change. Causality is tight under a situational/causal hybrid lens: rising skepticism → moment of fraying → Elias’s ritual intervention → signatures. The Weeping Conjunction and the terrace history are integrated rather than ornamental, and closure lands with a visible shift in the political reality. Stakes are large but contained to this act, avoiding false sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and purposeful: arrival → contemplation/backstory → ritual act → departure into thunder, with all beats causal under a largely accumulative lens. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he sacrifices the egg, gains no forgiveness, and leaves with only a hollow resonance as cost. Orientation is immediate and clear, and there are no causality breaks. The drive is quiet but coherent, with the journey logically funnelling into the single decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by brief reflection, advancing logically from courtyard to prism to release. The accumulative drive—years of harvested echoes used in one culminating rite—supports a coherent before/after reconfiguration of the city’s emotional landscape. Closure is solid, though the ritual succeeds without friction, undercutting a sense of risk or possible failure. The causal logic is intact and legible, but the climax feels a touch too assured.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal line is clean: aftermath of the argument → contact with the story stick → recollection of the show and the regular → ethical doubt → decision to stage a responsive piece. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly with the dome, Elara’s exit, and Kaelen’s role, and the reflection stays anchored to on-page stimuli. Closure lands as a clear reconfiguration of his approach to storytelling, with a visible cost in the form of acknowledged responsibility. The structure is simple but well-shaped for this length, with no dangling setups.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and coherent: set-up of the ritual goal, the long middle of preparation, then the arrival of the butterflies and the last one passing as he finishes the culminating knot. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds effectively toward a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Causality is simple but sound (his structures shape the butterflies’ path; the dwindling stream tightens the clock), and there are no orientation or logic slips. The felt cost—the finality of the species’ extinction and the modesty of his response—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: fragment → decision to use the rope → intricate reweaving → illumination → sigil → plan to cast in silver. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, but each step follows logically and stays focused on one dominant problem. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot recover the sound but redefines success as honoring its pattern in light and metal, with the cost of accepting that limit. There are no orientation issues; the single-scene arc is tight and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: we move from setup (bunker, directive, seal) to method (interpreted dreams) to decisive act (ingesting the seal) to transformed state and closure. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: the storm and structural failure compress time, the dreams reframe his options, and his choice produces a concrete and conceptual shift. Closure is strong—a clear before/after as he passes from fragmented time into presence, with drowning and ruin as the implied price. A very minor weakness is how smoothly the dream interpretation aligns with the correct solution, trimming potential ambiguity or misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous ritual scene that moves from preparation through execution to aftermath, with clear causal steps (tile → diagram → alignment → hum → star-cloud). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Kavi gains a secret cosmos and renounces worldly stakes, with the before/after cleanly legible. The only limitation is that the cost of “a piece of his soul” remains implied rather than concretely tested, keeping the arc just shy of devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is cleanly causal: Elara presents the object → initiates cellular persuasion → causes Vale’s recoil and cosmic intensification → pushes into the core wound → triggers the critical choice and resolution. Orientation (who, where, what’s at stake) is established early and remains clear despite the abstract cosmology. Closure is a decisive change: Vale’s shift from entrenched resentment to acceptance, with the universe stabilizing as direct consequence. The main limitation is that the “catalyst” light appears somewhat conveniently, feeling more like a preordained tool than something fully earned by prior maneuvers.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is tight: workshop → orchard → breathing ritual → brief attainment → shattering → reconfigured understanding, with no wasted moves. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: her preparation and method produce the vision, and the cessation of breath ends it, leading directly to the closure realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she conceptually revalues the dream from unattainable vision to readable map with an implied cost in its ephemerality. The only slight limitation is that the middle does not introduce a major complicating turn; the path from intention to success is smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: problem (sick Heartwood), failed attempt with traditional tools, rummaging in the satchel, discovery of ribbon and seed, reframed understanding, and a new tactic that lands closure. Causal links are strong and easy to follow, and the reflection interleaves cleanly with present action. The closure—a conceptual revaluation of what “mending” means, plus a concrete new state of the crystal—reads clearly as a before/after. The cost, while present in his renunciation of old methods and emotional surrender to Lyra’s view, feels somewhat gentle and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: orchard → retreat to bathroom → concentrated inquiry → conceptual breakthrough → return to orchard. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure is a convincing Conceptual Repricing: the cameo’s emptiness and Kaelen’s role are redefined. Causality is coherent and orientation strong; each move flows logically from his mounting paradox-headache and need for clarity. The main limitation is that the stakes stay mostly conceptual, so the felt cost of the new understanding at closure isn’t as sharp as the intellectual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s arrival reframes her goal, Lyra’s diary gives her a method, this yields the hidden wall, and then the negotiation with the Curators unlocks the staircase. The piece holds a clear throughline under a causal lens with a single focused arc toward access to the Library. Closure lands as a charged poise: she moves from barred scholar to sanctioned seeker, with the “rescued past” reweighting prior work. The main structural weakness is that the Curators’ acceptance comes a bit easily—no real reversal or surprise in their decision—so the climactic negotiation feels slightly under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: each use of a new swatch deepens the memory entanglement and leads logically to the final, overwhelming “Ocean’s Heart” experience. Orientation (who/where/what she wants) is established early, and the drive to find the Garden of Forgotten Names is maintained as a throughline. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the Garden is reframed from place-to-be-found into memorial-to-be-built, with a palpable emotional cost. There are no major causality or pattern breaks, though external complication is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: anomalous door → pattern recognition → retrieval of seal and rope → reconfiguration → integration and new room. Structure fits the length well, with a clear middle tightening around the decision to use the rope and mechanism. Closure lands as a quiet but solid reconfiguration—reality is altered and the absence is catalogued—under a largely causal lens. The main limitation is that consequences feel almost entirely positive; the conceptual cost of tampering with reality’s seams is underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: intolerable hum → search for catalyst → ice-map reading → ritual → bloom of hush. Orientation is very solid; we always know where we are and why each step follows. Closure is decisive and on-page, with the world’s before/after clearly marked by the silence. The main limitation is that the path to success feels somewhat linear and unproblematic, with no serious structural complication or doubt once the method is chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: years of work are compressed into backstory anchored in the present, culminating in a single high-stakes alignment night. Causality holds—his retrocognitive visions → star-path hypothesis → long preparations → precise assembly → activation of the beacon. Closure is a Decisive Change/RR: the beacon rekindles, reconfiguring the silence from finality to pause with an emotional cost in his endured loneliness. There are no orientation issues; time, space, and drive remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → crystal discordance → investigation via shadows → bolt alignment → console input → revelation → decision. Structure is tight and linear, with one clear escalation and a satisfying conceptual-repricing closure. The cost of the final stance—choosing not to recover the buried sorrow—is legible on the page. No orientation or lens-clarity issues interfere with the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival → searching that yields nothing → discovery of the rag knot → methodological shift → decoding the wall → reframed understanding and departure. Causality is tight under an accumulative/textural lens, with each sensory engagement feeding the next insight. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the hush and the fortress-as-formula, with a legible before/after in his stance. The cost (no external “cure,” only his ongoing labor) is present but understated rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—a single charged pause filled with interior movement—reads clearly and coherently under an accumulative/textural lens, with external anchors (“Then it is decided,” the grotto, the snail) holding orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing of the breakup into a “transition,” with an identifiable before/after in her stance. The cost (accepting heartache and altered connection) is legible but somewhat under-pressured on the page, keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: we move from bunker setup to ascent, to trellis experience, to return, with clear causal links anchored by the inversion hour. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he’s still in the same bunker but his relationship to enclosure has changed, with a visible cost in how hard-won that calm feels. The drive is mainly accumulative/textural but coherent, with no causality breaks or orientation issues. Escalation is modest and almost entirely internal, which is effective but keeps the arc a bit soft for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is a clean single-scene arc with clear orientation, causal throughline (fear → guided listening → reconfigured stance), and a solid Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the woman’s relationship to silence changes. The global drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: the layered “architecture of the hush” builds toward a conceptual and emotional repricing of silence. Cost is modest but present in her need to face her own unshielded thoughts and Elian’s chosen solitude; nothing in the structure undermines this.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: the deadline and purge threat drive her to the waterfall, her lore skills open the veil, investigation of the pillar yields the map, the shard completes the system, canceling the purge. The story lands a clear closure unit (Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the throne needs a heart, not a body) with stakes resolved on-page. Structure is tight—one continuous arc with a deepening middle in the pillar sequence—but the path from orchard entrance to solution is almost frictionless, with no serious complication once she’s through the veil. A touch more resistance or a tactical adjustment midstream would strengthen the feeling of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—a two-shard design (Elara in the ruins, Liam in his room) under an accumulative/textural lens—is clean, legible, and causally linked via the scar-connection ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, a severed bond and suffocation; after, a fragile conduit and his first real breath with cost implied by the burned house and six-month break. Each beat follows coherently (“she pushes feeling” → “he jolts and breathes”), with no orientation debt. The only limit is that the global drive stays mostly interior and quiet, never pressing to a harder, choice-driven inflection of options.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: the Promise’s manifestation, Elara’s volunteering, and the final stabilization form a clear causal chain with no major gaps. Backstory is efficiently anchored to present triggers (OmniVex when she sees the Promise; the bolt when the texts mention it) and alters her tactics rather than pausing the scene. Closure is decisive—she changes the outcome of a potentially catastrophic event and reconfigures her own relationship to “promise” itself—with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that the overseers’ plan and the danger of failure remain slightly schematic, blunting the sense of complex tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is tight: a single ritual scene in the reading room, causally progressing from crank-turning to intensifying hum to revelation to emotional aftermath. The inferred drive lens is hybrid but dominated by accumulative/textural pressure—sound and atmosphere build until they break into insight—and this lens holds cleanly through the ending. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s understanding of her lineage and her role is decisively reweighted with clear conceptual cost (power surrendered for safety). There are no orientation issues or causality breaks, and the final beat closes the initial question in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: failing equations → need for intervention → retrieval and use of the program → escalating storm → precise unsnapping of the clasp → world rewritten. The story maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues and pays off its setup objects (program, clasp, obsidian dais) directly in the climax. Closure is solid: the world is reconfigured, the tool destroyed, and Kaelen’s role continues under a new configuration, with a clear before/after. The cost is slightly more conceptual than dramatic, but still legible enough to satisfy this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight and causal: quiet cataloging → noticing the dust discrepancy → unfolding → reveal of button → embossed message → reconfiguration of her grief and vocation. The drive lens is accumulative/textural, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she re-sees the archive as “a library of unknown histories” and formalizes the button’s meaning. Cost is present—her heartbreak persists, but her stance toward it and her work changes in a felt way. No orientation or causality gaps appear; the only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the escalation remains very gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: network silence → recognition that her covert network is gone → decision to use the puddle-map route → reaching the lagoon and activating the phone booth to seed truth. Structure is tight, essentially two contiguous phases (city journey, lagoon activation) with clear escalation toward a focused closure image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: the world is fractionally altered by her act, and the before/after is clear in the disrupted broadcasts. The main limitation is that everything proceeds according to plan with no serious obstacles or reversals, which blunts some potential structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: the prophecy begins to coalesce in the drip pattern, Elias responds with his negative-space playing, the crystal resonates, and the prophecy is extinguished. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—a restored hush and a resonant, nostalgic final image—lands clearly. The price is largely emotional and cyclical (he does what he has done before), which works, but the turn from emerging threat to successful suppression is smooth rather than sharply pressured. The sense that this is another iteration of a repeating duty is effective, though a slightly more legible tightening or risk at the climax would strengthen structural impact at a top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: folklore → methodical sorting/monuments → anomalous leaf and speck → deliberate prod → arbor awakening and self-redefinition. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/what he does) and the structure is a single, legible build toward the climactic touch. Closure lands as a decisive change, but the cost dimension is underplayed; the transformation is almost purely positive, so the before/after lacks a sharp edge of loss or risk. Still, the story comfortably satisfies a coherent, causal arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: scattered cogs → estate search → greenhouse mechanism → hidden passage → cavern epiphany. The story follows a tight puzzle-quest spine and lands in an internal reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) that clearly marks a before/after in Elias’s stance. Cost—relinquishing the need to “repair” systems—is implied but not dramatized as a difficult trade-off, keeping the stakes more contemplative than urgent. Structure fits the length and closes satisfyingly without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece uses a simple but effective causal structure: search fails → Kael attempts forbidden-edge transmutation → ritual peaks → transformed coin reconfigures his relationship to loss. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, with the ritual and coin’s change directly triggering Kael’s internal pivot. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when are all clear), and the narrative stays within one pressurized scene. The only limitation is that the danger of the procedure never quite feels like it might derail events, so the path to closure is controlled rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and causal: Silas descends, engages the anguished spirit, shifts tactics, and achieves a reconfiguration that clearly closes the story. The spectral harp’s discord → clear melody → dissolution into sunrise gives a legible before/after with emotional cost implied in both her letting go and his tired satisfaction. Stakes and objective are constant and coherent, with no causality breaks or orientation issues. The only limitation is how smoothly the solution arrives once he asks for a joyful memory, keeping the escalation modest rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: anesthesia fades → orientation in the forest → following the path/hum → confrontation with the tree → conceptual reveal and stance shift. Causality is mostly accumulative-situational, with physical sensations triggering memories that deepen context rather than drive discrete external turns. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the forest reframes from punishment to experimental crucible, and Kaelen’s goal reorients from escape to understanding, with the implied cost of remaining in the experiment. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (“perish in the static”), so the final turn lands more intellectually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the lens and its history → the market → the wrong lighthouse painting → the hidden wreck → the unfastening, and closure lands with a clear before/after (the painting and history are changed). The drive lens reads as predominantly causal with a lyric overlay, and the story honors that to the end. Cost is legible in the exhausted, lighter lens and the idea that reality itself is “wrenched,” though the price paid by the protagonist could be sharpened. Structure—a single continuous scene framed by brief past context—is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: power cut → ghost appears → ghost indicates ceiling → Leo observes anomaly → retrieves mainspring → ghost releases. Orientation is excellent from the outset, and the single-scene structure is tight and legible. Closure lands clearly in the act of retrieval and the ghost’s dissolution, with a small but definite reconfiguration of Leo’s day and purpose. The cost is subtle (he chooses the spectral duty over a clean exit), so the arc feels exquisite but not maximal in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: preparation → releasing the whisper → frost-coding → rupture → transformed library. Closure is strong: the perfect system is permanently altered, and the Operator’s goal is achieved at a conceptual price (the loss of static eternity). The drive lens feels Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, but the causal linkages remain legible throughout. The only limitation is that the cost is more implied and conceptual than directly dramatized in the Operator’s perception or options afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: looming temporal squall → protective ritual with mirrors → shard left uncovered → shard interacts with visible time → images that reconfigure Kaelen’s belief and future tactics. Structure is a single, coherent scene that escalates from quiet prep to a charged revelation, closing on a clear Conceptual Repricing and renewed resolve. Closure has cost: he doubles down on a path that risks professional ridicule and deepens his lifelong, already-lost struggle. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal spine) is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: encroaching rust → build device → enter chamber → rust’s mental assault → near-failure → recommitment → successful chord that changes the world. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the story adheres to a tight single-scene structure with one major internal crisis. Closure is decisive and on-page: the chord re-tunes the world and visibly reverses the rust’s victory, with the “before/after” legible in sky and color. The only slight weakness is how swiftly the world-scale threat is solved once he regains focus, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: factory shuts → interference ceases → compass points true → fissure revealed → maze → psychometry → hinged stone → lagoon → renunciation. Orientation is excellent from the outset, and the structure fits a single, continuous descent culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing at the lagoon. The psychometry functions as a conveniently available ability, but it’s at least gestured to as a known, costly method rather than a deus ex machina. Closure lands with a felt cost (she gives up capturing the scent and the compass) and a clear before/after in how she understands her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery → projection → revelation of covenant → incoming wave → application of the pattern to survive → conceptual shift about her role. The story observes a tight single-scene structure with one clear escalation and a decisive, on-page resolution that carries both physical and conceptual cost. The drive lens reads dominantly causal with an accumulative thematic overlay, and the closure unit (surviving by honoring the alliance, then reinterpreting her work) is legible. There are no orientation issues or causality cheats undermining the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is coherent and well-scaled: postcards → cathedral search → window experiment → ancestral revelation → reoriented exit. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new layer of glass functioning as a structured deepening of knowledge. Closure is a solid conceptual repricing: the night-blooming question is reweighted via the cosmic root system and familial thesis. Stakes remain mostly conceptual/identity-level, so the arc feels more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: diary → retrocognitive pull → repeated failed parleys → new framing of the message → spectral response → deciphered coordinate. The two-shard structure (zeppelin study and psychic lagoon) is legible, with the transition clearly motivated by Kaelen’s choice to “surrender to the pull.” Closure lands via a decisive change in knowledge and options—the coordinate—reconfiguring the overarching investigation with implied cost. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (we don’t yet see direct danger or concrete consequence in the present), which keeps the plot from feeling fully maximal at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: present-tense ritual framed by concise backstory (the Djinn’s final wish) leading to a clear closure beat where Kaelen commits to a lifetime of creation. Causality holds—his choice to use memory produces visible lantern-lights—and the ending offers a quiet but legible Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Escalation is modest: the shift from one lantern to two to the decision to continue is more tonal deepening than a strong structural turn. A slightly sharper inflection point or complication in the middle would strengthen the sense of a before/after divide.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: the horn’s silence → new recording → immersion in the shaving → prophetic voice → reinterpretation of the horn and his life’s work → new mission, with no orientation debt. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing and Charged Poise: his understanding of the city’s history and his role is irrevocably reweighted, and the cost to his identity and to the metropolis is legible. Structure is tight for the length—a single continuous scene with one controlled foray into backstory that directly enables the central action. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that no subsequent tactic or counterforce tests his new stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: inciting event (egg hatched, reality dying), methodical attempt, and a contained closure where the vortex stabilizes and she gains conceptual insight. Causality is straightforward and legible, and the accumulative/textural drive (inviting, gathering, returning order) holds consistently. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive reversal, and the cost reads as conceptual (awareness of borrowed time’s fragility) rather than dramatically tested. The absence of a complication or setback makes the arc feel slightly too smooth for top-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term observation → discovery of the resonance and rope → impending “storm”/alignment → countdown → breaker throw and tuning. The zero-hour structure with the ticking clock gives solid shape and leads to an on-page decisive change with conceptual repricing at the end. The main weakness is that the hack works too smoothly—the system “accepts his authority without question” and there’s little sense it could fail—so the felt cost of the choice is more conceptual than dramatic. Still, closure is clear and satisfying within the chosen scope.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: custodial routine → private ritual → intensified experiment with empathy → reconfigured understanding at the end. Causality under an accumulative lens holds: his years of tracing lead logically to the decision to “feel,” which directly yields the climactic experience and realization. Closure is clear and earned, with a before/after in how he interprets dust and his role, though the cost is more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story is cleanly structured around a single escalating throughline: from sighting Lyra’s gesture, to unearthing the box, to opening it and reconfiguring the haunting. Causality is tight—his decade of silence leads to the covenant-box, which causes the ghosts’ tethering and their release. Closure (a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis) lands clearly with shared burden and a new, quieter companionship. The only limitation is that the interim beats between noticing the box and opening it could test his resistance a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: obsession → experiment (garage sale) → signal received → activation of the silo → reconfiguration of his relationship to time. Causality broadly works, but the pivotal traveler message feels like a convenient gift rather than the result of escalating tactics or compounded pressure. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration—the before/after of his stance toward time is clear, with some implied cost in the dissolution of his old drive. The accumulative/lyric lens holds, yet the decisive turn arrives a bit too easily to reach elite-level rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: kite loss → discovery of feather → interior weaving → closing image of child leaving and feather pocketed. Causality is modest but coherent under a textural lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the incident is repriced as part of Kaelen’s ongoing practice. The cost—accepting the child’s grief as material rather than intervening—is subtle but legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: diagnosis → decision to create legacy → method via diary → systematic wiring → final connection → awakening of the system → his death in earned peace. Structure is a single continuous arc with a brief, well-anchored flashback, and the temporal montage (“Days bled into weeks”) is efficient. Closure is strong: he achieves the bridge he sought at the explicit cost of his life and leaves a charged final symbol. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light lyric overlay, and it holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: trailhead → path → tower → realization and sacrifice, under an accumulative drive where atmosphere and reflection build to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Causality is intact and legible—each phase of the walk deepens his stance and leads logically to the tower scene. Closure is solid: the act of leaving the amber and the reframed understanding of “artificial” mark a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The main weakness is a slight essayistic feel at the epiphany, which softens the sense of dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → consultation with birds → distributed planting → birds’ dismissal and his resolved departure. Causality is coherent (bird calls → specific placements and seed choices), and the closure as a quiet earned stasis/charged poise is legible: he has altered the jetty and accepted the long, incomplete nature of the task. Stakes stay modest and contemplative; there’s no significant structural surprise or reversal, but the design fits an accumulative/textural lens well. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: cylinder → failed listening → Barrow’s reaction → realization of groove-writing → decoding → journey → discovery of the cavern and sapling. The structure is linear and legible with one clear escalation from static mystery to hopeful revelation, and the closure (reframing the grandmother’s message as a promise) lands cleanly. Cost is present as risk in leaving the settlement and days of straining work, though opposition is gentle and mostly environmental. The piece reads as a compact causal quest with a solid conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: ritual → intensifying distortion → glimpse → revaluation of self and station. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—her “confusion” and the shutdown are reinterpreted, with a clear before/after. Causality is mostly internal and metaphysical, with no major breaks, but the cost of the new stance remains abstract, so the decisive change doesn’t bite as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: the wrong sky enables the ascent, the climb leads to the observatory, the sundial trick creates an opening, and the swap plants the seed that reconfigures Sylas’s world. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous mission scene with a clear beginning, middle, and conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is solid: Sylas’s encounter with the seed and Kael’s joyful exit make the before/after legible, with the paradox’s confinement effectively “amended.” Stakes around the “captured paradox” and celestial clock remain a bit abstract and under-tested in scene, which keeps the resolution from feeling fully weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: Elara’s suspicion → SECRET → recognizing the prisoner → RELEASE → UNBIND, with each cycle tightening pressure and leading causally to the Regent’s decision. The single continuous setting and clear temporal progression (“The next day…”) keep orientation firm. Closure is on-page and legible: the prisoner is freed and the Regent’s calculus is reconfigured, with emotional cost implied for both. Stakes are somewhat abstracted to emblematic gestures rather than concrete outcomes beyond that door opening, which slightly softens the impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: touch of the wooden book → vision of the stone → search → anticlimax with inert stone → recall of feather method → activation and reconfiguration of her relationship to home. Orientation (who/where/what she wants) is solid within the first paragraph and never slips. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from seeking a lost object/past to actively laying a present foundation, with the bookstore now reframed. The emotional cost of abandoning her nightly substitute realities is legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: exile → deliberate arrival in Stillwater → focused study of tapestry and labyrinth → re-examination of the fatal game → insight → spell breaks. The piece holds a single continuous scene anchored in present action, with backstory tightly interwoven and always tilting his current attempt. Closure is strong and legible: his conceptual shift about forgiveness coincides causally with the unraveling of the hush. If anything, the decoding process resolves slightly quickly once he notices the frayed border, but not enough to damage the structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that tightens from clandestine poetry session to solitary final act as the ritual nears. Causality is coherent—her method of questioning the canyon builds to the climactic poem that literally fractures the Absolution’s “single truth.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s rules are reweighted, the ritual’s premise is broken, and the cost (capture by the Wardens) is legible. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a clear culminating turn, and no orientation debt appears.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: descend → begin ritual → escalate along the statue’s damage → crisis at the heart → reframe and complete, with the breath constraint and acid environment providing a persistent clock. Closure is a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: she succeeds in healing the statue’s “story,” and in the process redefines the Great Silence as dignified meaning rather than void, with the golden light and easing lungs as concrete payoff. Stakes (history vs oblivion, survival vs suffocation) are declared early and directly tested. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the single-scene causal frame holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: journey into the caves → wrong turn → discovery of oasis → ritual with the shell, with backstory interleaved at clear physical anchors. Causality holds under an accumulative lens, and the wrong turn functions as a meaningful divergence that becomes the true destination. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: promise fulfilled, memory relocated, and his inner burden altered with a visible cost (relinquishing the shell). The only limitation is relatively soft on-page pressure, which keeps the arc emotionally restrained rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: failed foghorn → Elias’s alternative belief → channeling intent through the lens → Stellaria’s safe arrival, with the captain’s testimony closing the loop. Single-scene structure with minimal backstory is tight and easy to follow, and the closure (his method vindicated, ship saved) is legible. Cost is modest and internal, but there is a real before/after in both the ship’s situation and the validation of the island’s stories. A more explicit on-page consequence (e.g., confrontation with Hemlock or personal risk) would deepen the sense of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious calls → construction of the array → final placement of the bronze → activation and emotional reconfiguration. The structure sticks to a single throughline with one clear tightening at midnight when the decisive instruction arrives, and closure as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration lands on the page with felt cost. Some stakes remain abstract—the “reverse migration” and its consequences are gestured at rather than tested—so the finale is more conceptual than dramatically pressured. Still, the before/after (lonely grief vs. grief with chosen function) is legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: virus → affliction → research in fringe texts → acquisition of relic → storm attunement → test via neighbor’s question. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: he gains a bounded capacity for privacy at a visible cost (surrendering his prior absolute transparency and risking the unknown side effects). Structure is straightforward single-arc without dropped threads. Escalation and resolution are well timed for the length, though another tiny on-page complication around the ritual could have deepened tension.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: discovery → weeks-long investigation → interpretive realization → commemorative act, with no causality breaks. The accumulative drive through repeated sessions with the flower coheres and leads directly to the closing reconfiguration. Closure lands as a quiet but clear conceptual shift: Silas reframes the man’s act and his own solitude, with an on-page cost in the “weight of one less ghost.” Some middle material is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly flattening the sense of progressive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: ants → fissure → cavern → chip activation → visions → decision, all under a clear time constraint from the rising creek. Structure is straightforward single-POV, single main scene with brief, well-anchored backstory. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he understands the doorway’s nature and chooses not to enter, gaining peace at a visible emotional cost. There are no major causal gaps or unkept setups, though the time-pressure from the creek is more atmospherically than tactically engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: prophecy → decision to climb → grotto discovery → direct confrontation with the pool’s cost → renunciation. The structure is taut, with no orientation issues and one clear escalation path from court to mountain to grotto. Closure lands as an earned stasis/decisive renunciation with on-page cost—she chooses a burdensome duty over a seductive void. The only minor limit is that the astrologer’s “ruin” warning doesn’t fully complicate events beyond framing the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves causally from failed experiment → confession → revaluation → new attempt → charged gift, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: she abandons static perfectionism and redefines alchemy as collaboration with feeling, with the cost of accepting Kael’s departure. The story holds a mostly causal lens, with accumulative texture deepening the emotional stakes rather than muddying them. A slight tendency to summarize her philosophical shift in explicit language, rather than letting the final image alone carry it, keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: present struggle with the scroll → deepening backstory/reflection → embodied trance/flight → reengagement with the scroll and new stance. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: his jealousy triggers the trance, which produces the perspective shift that reconfigures his motivation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with a clear before/after in his relationship to his own timeline, though the cost (ongoing grief, instability) could be sharpened a touch more on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear inciting incident (the request to humanize the screw), a deepening middle (her tactile reading), and a resonant closure. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is strong: each sensory and emotional detail builds toward the man’s revaluation of his wife’s “music” and Elara’s revaluation of her own loss. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: both characters leave changed in stance, with the cost (her permanent loss of smell, his enduring grief) still present but newly weighted. Orientation is impeccable; no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by a literal held breath, with clear causal flow from failed logical attempts → rising stress → remembered superstition → experimental naming → shedding. Closure is a decisive change (the affliction softens and flakes away) tied directly to his on-page choice, with the new understanding articulated in the final paragraph. Stakes and orientation are clear from very early on, and there are no causality breaks or dangling set-ups. The only limiter is that the pattern of escalation is fairly straightforward, with no unexpected but inevitable turn beyond what the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear causal chain (hire Vex → set up device → ritual → emotional deluge → partial resolution). The dominant drive lens is causal, and the closure (Julian’s stance reconfigured from desperate reconnection to painful acceptance) is legible with cost. Stakes tied to the impending demolition provide a simple but effective ticking clock that returns at the end with the diesel engines. There are no causality breaks or unkept setups, though escalation is relatively linear and risk-light.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from ongoing ritual, to conceptual revelation about “spiral arbitration,” to enactment of that concept in her final unification. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—her understanding deepens and leads to her relinquishing the dictionary and self. Closure is solid as both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, though the outcome feels somewhat foregone and under-pressured. The single-scene continuity and consistent focus on her walk prevent confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight: whistle → discrepancy → focused investigation → ice shard → reinterpretation and choice to let it stand. Structure is cleanly single-scene with one deepening turn at the discovery of the impossible ice, leading to a conceptual and ethical closure. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts a “flaw” that redefines his life’s project, with the price being the relinquishing of total control and precision. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, but it is legible and coherent under an accumulative/textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal line (observation of familiar strangers → long-term project → present attempt with the resonator → successful opening → emotional cost) and maintains orientation throughout. Closure lands firmly as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: he uses his invention not to reclaim but to relinquish, and the “before/after” of his inner state is legible. The stakes are contained but coherent, and nothing essential feels unkept or retrofitted. A touch more on what could go wrong (for him or the farm) would deepen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: inheritance → note/cipher → subway quest → final message → lantern lighting and conceptual shift. The piece uses a compressed, almost montage middle (“For weeks, she journeyed…”) but the pattern of clue → destination → new clue is intelligible and escalates knowledge. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: she redefines risk and her father’s life, with a visible cost in her relinquishment of pure certainty. The main limitation is that no individual beat of the quest is dramatized enough to create strong mid-story turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous late-night call accumulates pressure through looping dialogue and sound until the caller’s stance subtly reconfigures. Causality is simple but coherent—Silas’s method shapes the man’s thinking, leading to the final observation about silence as a new sound. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (Silas’s continued isolation vs. the man’s new grammar), though the “hour” of conversation is compressed and largely summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged locket → choice to attempt dangerous restoration → revelation of Lyra and Cael → recognition of the feud’s true origin → compulsion to the jetty → encounter and shared realization with Tomas → reborn covenant. The structure (archive/workshop to jetty) is legible and well-contained for the length, with a clear before/after in the social reality of the towns and in Elara’s understanding of her work’s impact. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: a small act of preservation reshapes a century of meaning, with the cost of “ghosts of generations” on the page. The one soft spot is how neatly Tomas and the miraculous blooming align without friction, which slightly lowers the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: world apathy → his plan via rumor → arrival of seekers → his decision to step in and reframe the myth in practice. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; the lens (causal with a situational flavor) holds end-to-end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he remains lonely but no longer alone, and the “cure” is redefined as slow communal winding rather than a magical fix. The stakes and cost at the end are clear, though the critical decision beat could bear slightly more immediate pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: follow the ring from note to note, assemble a melody, arrive at the Stillpoint. Causality is stable and closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: the world’s sound reorganizes, and so does his grief. Orientation is clean and the quest logic holds, but the journey passes without any meaningful complication or tactical change; each beat is essentially “another note found.” This smoothness slightly flattens the sense of narrowing options or increasing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: anomaly → resurfaced signal → experimental edits → cascading alternate disasters → relinquishing the urge to rewrite and sending commentary instead. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the fantasy of undoing the past while revaluing his role as interpreter rather than savior. The brief montage of alternate catastrophic futures is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly blunts the force of escalation but doesn’t break it. Overall, the structure is elegant and fully legible within the chosen window.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: each “mapping” expands and deepens the pressure of silence until the ferry landing sequence crystallizes it. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: he seeks deeper silence → Lyra directs him → he finds the nexus → he disrupts it, leading to the harbor’s reweighted state. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s silence is no longer empty but “filled with a quiet, unending song,” and Lyra dissolves into that. The cost is subtle but present in his letting go of pure stillness and of Lyra’s separate presence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: his arson and exile lead to the archive, following Elara’s trail leads to the sealed chamber, and the tapestry plus sunlight enable the revelation, which in turn reorients his life’s purpose. Structure holds as one continuous investigative scene with a clear tightening at the discovery of the vandalized portrait and the deciphering of the hidden text. Closure is a decisive change from destructive to creative tactics, with an emotional cost implied in relinquishing revenge as primary drive. A slightly more concrete sense of what external obstacles remain would deepen the feeling of cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean, causal single-scene arc: she leaves her room, reaches the lab, drums, and the lagoon manifests, with each step logically motivated. The accumulative/textural drive—pressure mounting through intensifying rhythm and light—holds consistently. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final image: she has achieved the dream yet is confronted with the void of Leo’s absence, a cost legible in “a duet for one.” No significant orientation or lens ambiguity issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: storm → systems failure → Kaelen’s challenge → Silas’s search method → trick container opening → social reversal. The story holds a single scene and drive lens, and the closure—a reconfiguration of power and respect—is clear and earned. The main limitation is that the “race against the storm” never quite pressures his tactics; success feels assured once his tools are revealed. Strong, but not yet structurally bracing enough for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: child’s warning → preparation (shutters, mirror) → contact → response → earned stasis with the single sliver of light. Causality is tight within an accumulative, ritualistic frame, and the before/after shift in the canal’s darkness is legible. The cost is subtle (ongoing vigil and the choice not to banish darkness), so the closure is resonant but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—library → grotto → ninth-bell culmination—tracks cleanly and feels cohesive, with the grotto interlude functioning as a deliberate tightening rather than a digression. Causality is simple but solid: Authority’s proclamation → Elias’s plan → the synchronized displays → town’s chord shift and Maya’s thought. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s inner stance toward prophecy shifts, and the future becomes “a conversation that had just begun.” The cost is more implied than dramatized (risk of punishment remains off-page), which keeps this short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clear and efficient: the docks scene establishes longing → scrimshaw catalyzes Elara’s honesty → night ritual in the cove → island rises → Kaelen departs. Closure is strong, with a decisive change (leaving home for the island) and a visible cost (abandoning Elara and safety) on the page. The scrimshaw’s function as a “key” working on the first attempt feels slightly convenient, with minimal sense of risk or potential failure. Still, the structure is tight for the length and lands a coherent, legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: a single continuous scene that moves from ritualized tea-making to silent whittling to a charged final tableau. Causality is modest but coherent—each act arises from his need to manage forbidden grief under the mandate, culminating in the offering of the bird. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he has not escaped the regime, but he has claimed a small, costly interior refuge. The piece does lean more on mood than overt turns, which keeps it just shy of exceptional in structural dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, steadily deepening into immersion and culminating in a conceptual revaluation of the colonnade (from chaos to blueprint). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: his method (dissolving boundaries) leads to the insight, which in turn reframes his future work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a clear before/after in understanding and vocation, but the cost is understated—no tangible threat or sacrifice is dramatized despite the history of madness and bans. The ban and its danger stay largely contextual rather than structurally active.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Lyra’s fading → rumor of bartered awakenings → plant-language puzzle → demand for a perfect sound → reed + glass resonator → note → Lyra waking. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous problem-solving arc in a single setting with a clear payoff and a strong closure image. The barter’s price is somewhat soft—there’s no sacrifice beyond craft and time—so the resolution feels a bit easy for the scale of the miracle. Still, closure lands clearly with a decisive change in situation and a reconfiguration of Elian’s self-understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: stalled quest → reinterpreting the clue (“see the echo”) → building the apparatus → tuning the bell to light rather than sound → completion of the carillon. The piece adheres to a single scene with light reflection and no orientation or lens confusion, and closure lands as a clear reconfiguration of what “sound” and “connection” mean (RR/CR). The main limitation is that the outcome unfolds with little resistance or uncertainty once the new approach is chosen, so the climax feels technically neat rather than hard-won. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying within the modest scale of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias sees the new mourner, repurposes the stencil into a series of origami invitations, which lead her through escalating cosmic experiences and finally to the central dais reveal. The structure is essentially a single continuous arc with summarized intervening days, and the closure beat—a shared witnessing of their intertwined constellations—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after. Cost is legible in his decision to repurpose the tattoo intended for Anya and to step out of the shadows, though the “observatory’s secret” exposition is a bit lore-dumpy rather than dramatized. The lens (hybrid but predominantly accumulative/textural) stays coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clean early: city, loft, rain, cards, time “after the great cryptocurrency crashes.” The structure is a single conversation framed by Elara’s method, closing with Julian’s reframed understanding—a solid Conceptual Repricing. The causal flow is simple but coherent: his question → her demonstration → her confession → his revaluation. Stakes and turns are modest, but the closure unit is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and coherent: preparation → ritual → inundation → realization → acceptance, with clear causal links at each step. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing and Earned Stasis—Elara becomes the entombing vessel and cannot return to who she was. The An-Korin downfall is largely summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly softens the impact of that realization as a structural turn. Still, the single-scene design, tight focus, and explicit cost at the end all work at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: noticed blight → comparative analysis → identification of origin → ethical decision → integration sequence and reconfigured archive. Backstory (the shared fall dream) is efficiently embedded and directly reweights the present conflict. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s archive transforms into a new, frost-tinged wholeness at emotional cost to Kael, who accepts enduring regret. Structure is a single continuous scene with a clear tightening, fully legible under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: betrayal → damage → painstaking repair → successful fitting → internal reconfiguration, all in a single continuous scene with one concise backstory shard. Causality is strong under a largely Causal lens, and the closure (healing the tail and reframing his convictions) lands clearly with before/after contrast. Stakes and sequence are easy to follow with no orientation debt. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the length, so the piece feels complete rather than slight.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: waking from anesthesia → ritual with coffee rings → tunneling into memory shared with ivy → realization at the hourglass. Causality is coherent under an accumulative lens: each object (ivy, hourglass, map, coffee) incrementally focuses the drive toward confronting what the procedure actually did. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: his quest for perfect closure is re-understood as the very mechanism that keeps pain alive. Stakes remain mostly internal, but the shared wound with the ivy gives the ending a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and causal under an accumulative/lyric lens: touch film → enter Arthur’s past → trace the “energy” into the building → emerge with a reweighted understanding. The rules of the psychometry are simple but consistent, and the single scene in the booth frames the interior excursion well. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—Elara’s quest receives a concrete, world-rooted answer that changes her stance, with the “inert” film and careful rewinding as a visible end-beat. Stakes are modestly scaled and almost entirely internal, but they’re coherently pursued from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: a single continuous vigil framed by past repetition, with a clear turn when the anomalous meteor appears and triggers conceptual repricing. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: long-term ritual → unusual stimulus → revelation → altered tactic (from soul-scribing meteors to sketching people). Closure is solidly on-page as a resonant reconfiguration, with a legible before/after in how she relates to the noise. Stakes remain largely internal and existential, but they’re coherent and scale appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: tremor in the archive → identification of the pine-memory threat → choice to integrate rather than erase → new hybrid creation and subtle internal shift. Causality is coherent and legible under an accumulative/textural lens, with the procedural “sinking into the hum,” net of awareness, and wave-function coaxing all paying off at closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after (no forests / ghost-memory / new crystal-pine and nascent dreaming) is clear. The cost—risk to the dune’s stability and Kaelen’s strain—is implied rather than made sharply felt, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story is cleanly structured as a single causal line: awakening → identifying a new sound → tracking it → confronting the quartz tree → revelation and reframed purpose. Orientation is strong and early, and the inferred drive lens—situational with accumulative textural escalation—remains consistent through to closure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: he reconceives his condition as guided participation rather than random exile, and the before/after is legible. The cost is a bit abstract and retrospective (prior suffering reinterpreted), rather than dramatized as a live sacrifice, which slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: vigil → arrival of guides → ascent by indirect routes → threshold → stamped ticket → solitary continuation. Causality is quiet but solid under an accumulative/textural lens—the leash breaks, so the path opens; the ticket marks readiness, so the mist thins. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Elara accepts the cost of walking into the unknown alone with a reweighted understanding of courage. The piece never loses orientation despite its lyricism, though pressures remain largely internal and soft.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: present-tense fortress frame, staircase-triggered memory, and a closure beat where he makes a new choice. Causality is tight—seeing the stain → remembering the accident → rejecting escape → making the nonverbal offering of the bolt. The drive lens reads as accumulative/situational, and the ending is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard reversal, but the before/after is clear. A slightly more dramatized interaction with the soloist could have sharpened the climax, but the current ending still lands with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: centuries of marginalia → convergence of power → retrieval of pellet → ritual at the nexus → sundering of the false star → dissolution of Kael and the library. The drive lens is primarily causal with a textural overlay, and closure is decisive and on the page, with the world’s history and the pretender’s power irrevocably altered. The structure (one continuous scene anchored by long-prepared backstory) fits the length and never loses orientation. The only limiter is that obstacles are minimal, so the outcome feels almost assured once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: past loss → long-term obsession → rare environmental confluence → failed attempt → symbol revelation → successful summoning and reframed understanding. The structure is tight for the length, with the neap tide / inversion alarm and first failure giving a satisfying escalation into the final beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Aris’s premise about “finding a place” is recast as “summoning a once-periodic eternity,” with the cost visible in the reef’s brief return and his ongoing mooring. Nothing crucial feels unearned or patched in late.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: discovery of a different approach → precise alignment via opera glasses → hum → stone activation → planetary signal → satellite response. Orientation (who/where/when, what the circle is, what she wants) is established early and maintained without confusion. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise: the lull is explicitly declared over and the world’s response reframes the “graveyard” as a live node, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. The structure is a tight single-scene escalation with no broken set-ups or retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: kite → script decoded via plant-telepathy → geothermal pool → orchestrated unsealing → embryo begins its programmed growth. The piece holds a single scene and drive lens without confusion, and the closure is clear: the world’s future has been quietly but irrevocably altered (a solid Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise). What’s thin is on-page cost and active resistance—nothing interrupts or complicates her execution beyond the implied delicacy of the process, so the arc feels more like a successful ritual than a trial. Still, structure is tight and oriented, with no major set-ups dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and causal: quiet work → intrusive sound/shadow trigger → full-blown somatic flashback → deliberate grounding → re-engagement with the task. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she cannot erase the cost of the sky but can continue choosing care in full knowledge of danger. The dominant stake—can she hold her life together in the presence of ever-present aerial menace—remains coherent throughout. All key set-ups (photo, tree, cliff/waves, “pearl of stillness”) pay off by the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from paralysis and claustrophobia, to discovery of the tarot box, to the decision to redesign and the mapping ritual, closing on a reconfigured stance. Causality under a textural lens holds—each physical action grows from prior perception and reflection. Closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration: he doesn’t fix the old order, he adopts a new one at acknowledged cost. The piece is intentionally quiet on external turns, so stakes stay internal, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: eclipse → rockslide/time dilation → appearance of drone → Kael’s inference about its significance → ritual with disappearing ink → disappearance in pursuit. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—Kael exits his world to follow the “quantum thread,” foreclosing other options. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual accent, and it holds without contradiction. The only limitation is that the rockslide and communal damage feel slightly under-integrated into the final choice, functioning more as pretext than as ongoing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the letter → internal moral crisis → decision to leak → execution through the dormant network → charged waiting. Closure is solidly on-page in the decisive keystroke and the final image of her watching the snow, with clear implied cost. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with no orientation issues. Escalation is more linear than twisty, but still coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with interleaved reflection that always hooks back to present action (plants → father → knife → choice). The drive lens is Situational/Accumulative: pressure comes from the knife’s presence and what it represents rather than external events, and closure is an Earned Stasis when she sheaths and boxes it. Causality is coherent and options narrow in a legible way; there’s a clear before/after in her stance toward inheritance. A slightly stronger sense of external consequence (what happens if she chose otherwise) could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: he enters the garden because it’s the night of pattern-break, tracks the echo via his abilities and spike, then performs a specific ritual to succeed. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the structure holds as a single continuous scene with no confusing jumps. Closure is on-page: he catches the echo, the goddess manifests briefly, and the cosmos settles, giving a clear before/after. The main limitation is that the cost of success is more conceptual than dramatically pressured on the page, which keeps the structural arc from feeling truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: journalist’s impending exposé → Celeste’s decision to counter → structured dismantling of his thesis → reconfiguration of the family story. The single-scene structure is tight, with backstory anchored to immediate sensory cues (observatory, pen nib) and feeding directly into her tactical choices. Closure lands via a clear reweighting of the father’s actions and Celeste’s stance toward his “orbit of regret.” Stakes and timeline are modest in scope but fully coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: letters → discovery of Lyra and the Lab → haunted firmware translating cries → his constellation-etching solution → silence and inner release. The piece lands a clear Decisive Change/RR at the end: the hum stops and Lyra’s voice rests, reconfiguring his before/after. The “another life” letters and his ability to manipulate circuitry via amber lean into magical realism rather than rigorous explanation but do not break the story’s internal logic. Structure holds as a two-shard movement (studio/backstory → lab/ritual) with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: orientation, object discovery (tile), resolve, artistic action, then communal response. Each step follows plausibly from the last, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the grotto’s hush shifts from numbing to charged attention. The dominant drive is textural/situational rather than causal in a thriller sense, but the internal logic never breaks. The cost at closure is quiet—vulnerability and effort rather than a hard sacrifice—which keeps the stakes modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: preparation with the tessera, activation of the stone, the renaming procedure, and the aftermath, all in one coherent causal chain. Closure is strong: Joric becomes Ren, the suffering loop is broken, and Kaelen recommits to scaling his “terrible and gentle gift,” giving a clear before/after. The cost is legible, if muted—the emptied self, Kaelen’s “hollow ache,” and the ethical shadow that lingers. There are no serious causality gaps, though external resistance or complication is absent, keeping the arc comparatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal arc: Julian senses despair, escalates his attempts, and achieves a visible transformation in Elara; orientation in time/place and stakes is clear early. The closure (Elara’s shift from paralyzing despair to purposeful movement, and Julian’s contented “encore”) is decisively on the page and structurally satisfying. Cost is present but muted—Julian pours “all of his spectral energy” into the applause yet seems to suffer no lingering consequence beyond fatigue resolved into peace. The lens reads as primarily causal with a light accumulative texture and holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: set-up of history and experiment, first trial as partial proof, second trial as the real test, then a resonant reconfiguration where he accepts a new shared language. Causality is tight under a Causal lens—each beat grows logically from the previous, especially moving from the funeral coincidence to the static shock recreation. Closure lands as a clear RR/CR: Elias’s worldview shifts enough to change future options between them, with a felt emotional cost. Stakes remain intimate rather than drastic, which is appropriate but slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single linear descent from cave mouth to inner chamber, escalating sensory input to a merger with the cavern and a coherent closure where she returns with the waveform and a redefined mission. Causality is straightforward (sensor → following violet awe → chamber resonance → levitation/merger → recorded “syllable”), with no missing links or teleports. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the unknown becomes a knowable, speaking presence, and her role reconfigures from mapper to translator. The cost is subtle but present as a one-way deepening of commitment rather than a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal throughline is clean: prophecy → duty → secret method (buttons) → deciphered prophecy-as-choice → last grain → decisive refusal. The accumulative middle section (unraveling history via buttons) clearly builds toward the single climactic decision and closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost. Time jumps (“days bled into weeks”) are efficient and orientation (who/where/when) is never in doubt. The only limitation is that escalation is mostly conceptual and retrospective rather than presenting more than one on-page turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: burned spy seeking to “fix” Vienna → clandestine meet in an ephemeral setting → revelation that “she” is alive and endangered → coordinates handed over via snow code → decision to go after her. The global drive is causal with a strong situational accent, and the closure (his turning away from Zephyr Bluff toward the Pyrenees) lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise with visible risk. Structure is simple but tight, with one major turn (she’s alive/needs rescue) that reweights everything prior. No orientation debt or causality gaps; the only limit is that external obstacles are largely deferred off-page, keeping the plot compact rather than fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: environmental cues (fog, chain, drip, hammering, then silence and bell) bracket a single reflective sequence. Causality under a textural lens is coherent—waiting → memory surfacing → revaluation of the promise → readiness to move on. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: he relinquishes the idea of a literal return and reframes it as ongoing compassion. The scene’s external action is minimal but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure progresses cleanly from arrival and first thrum, to discovery of the lantern glass, to experiment with kindness, to the sustained repair sequence and conceptual closure. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative lens: each choice (observing light angles, watering the rose, rebuilding the channel) deepens the thrum/vision response and clarifies the oasis’s rule. Closure lands firmly with a conceptual repricing of “resistance to change” as an accumulation of kindness, and that insight is paid for through labor and attention rather than exposition. Stakes remain intimate and philosophical, but for this scale they tighten adequately toward the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is simple but well-shaped: the last petal falls (loss of old method), she repurposes the bitting gauge (new tactic), then we accumulate nights until the blinds finally shift. Causality is clean and oriented from the start; we always know who, where, and when, and why each step follows. The drive lens is accumulative/textural, and the closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tiny widening of the window after repeated effort reconfigures the situation with a small but legible emotional cost. Stakes stay modest, but within that scale, the before/after is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative arc: mounting awakenings → decision to enter the heart → ritual with the sundial and stones → full immersion → reframed relationship to memory. Causality is clear under a textural lens: deeper attunement to the hum leads to the reflective floor blooming with extinct life, which triggers the reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—he remains in the same place but with a materially altered understanding that carries cost. The structure is simple but coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the temple → observation of the installation → recollection of her role as keeper of secrets → decisive act of placing the nest. Causality is clear under a textural lens, and closure lands via a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when she lets go of the object and reinterprets her past work. The cost—relinquishing her “only true secret”—is legible and tied directly to the central stake. A touch more on-page resistance or a complicating beat before the decision could deepen the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear and clean: strange signals → social unrest → her reverse-engineered counter-signal → observable de-escalation in the quad. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and backstory about prior broadcasts and protests is economical and grounded in present stimuli (charts, current signal). Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: she activates the sequence, witnesses a small but meaningful effect, and commits to ongoing resistance with the knowledge that the tricksters will adapt. The main limitation is that the felt cost at closure is modest, so the before/after distinction is more intellectual and atmospheric than viscerally wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → entering nexus → disorientation → recalling journals → playing the organ → escalation → using the compass to transfix → stable passage and retrieval of blueprints. Closure is a clear Decisive Change: the world resolves, the nexus stabilizes, and the “key” is obtained at on-page cost. The drive lens reads as Causal throughout, with no orientation debt or lens confusion. The only limitation is that the broader-world stakes (“mend the growing fractures in his own world”) arrive late and feel slightly tacked on rather than fully integrated into the on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a single, continuous scene with clean orientation and a clear accumulative drive toward a realizational closure. Each step of Elias’s ritual builds toward the climactic scratch on the canvas, which reconfigures the death site and his inner life in one gesture. Causality is simple but coherent—because he works through the quarry, mist, and ribbon in this way, the structural insight and empathy become possible. The cost—his fragile, painful stir of empathy—lands on the page and marks a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: discovering the journals → decoding the stanzas → locating the rock → retrieving the true log → contacting the Archives. Structure is tight for the length, with one clear escalation and a decisive ending that reconfigures the world’s history. The major weakness is how unopposed the path feels—no real resistance once he has the clues—so tension is more conceptual than experiential. Closure still lands as a decisive change in knowledge and stance with implied future conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from aftermath, through re-interpretation of Lyra’s words, to a new stance crystallized in the final act of playing. Causality/accumulation works: Lyra’s disappearance → the shard → decoding the mesh → decision to mimic it in music. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/incipient Decisive Change, but the cost remains mostly conceptual, with no concrete narrowing of external options. The drive lens (accumulative with a causal spine) is clear and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: startup arrival → escalating hauntings → CEO confrontation → delayed project → eventual collapse → reflective closure. The structure is linear with one tasteful elision (the startup’s fall summarized), and the ending offers a clear Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis around cycles of predation with an identifiable cost (Elias’s solitude and the limits of what he’s “changed”). Orientation is clear from early on and never slips. The one weakness is that the market-driven collapse feels somewhat convenient and under-dramatized relative to Elias’s efforts, softening the sense that his actions meaningfully reshape the ultimate outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: telegram → star chart → RR Lyrae observation → lucid dream → reinterpreted glyphs → written translation and emotional release. Structure is tight and single-POV with a clear present frame guiding the reflective material, and the accumulative lens (toward understanding) is maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his relation to the burden and telegram is reweighted with visible emotional cost and relief. Stakes remain modestly scaled and inward, which keeps the arc powerful but a bit contained in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival → ritual with expanding circles → discovery of the anchor branch → unbending it → release of the confession → planting the seed as coda. The dominant drive (recovering the frozen confession / breaking the curse) is continuously in play, and each step logically enables the next under a Causal lens. Closure lands decisively with the unbending and the released voice, carrying emotional cost and resolving the central question. The structure is straightforward but tight, with no orientation debt or major ellipsis problems.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: ritual → contact with Kael → warning about the false intersection → use of the clipping → discovery and transmission of a new path. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid within the first paragraph, and the piece maintains a single continuous scene with one dominant drive. Closure functions as a decisive change/charged poise: a new stable vector is created and shared, with the world’s fracture persisting as ongoing cost. The stakes remain somewhat abstract (cosmic repair more than a concrete immediate danger), which blunts the felt sharpness of the structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: past bargain → Elara’s void → catacomb orchard work → emergent shadow → sacrificial offering of memory → partial retreat of the void and recharged card. The story adheres to a single continuous scene with one major turn (shadow attack) and a clear, on-page closure beat (memory sacrifice and redefinition of the card) that carries cost. The drive lens is primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, and the world’s rules (void fed by bartered destiny, trees nourished by bones and memories) feel internally consistent. The only structural limitation is that escalation is relatively modest; the piece is more a finely executed vignette than a full dramatic arc, though it still lands a real before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: present-tense handling of the box → snagged cloth/recorder conflict → Chicago flashback → revaluation of quarry and cloth, with clear before/after. Causality under an accumulative lens is strong: each object cue justifies a deepening reflection that reweights the present. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he reclassifies both the quarry and the cloth in a way that subtly alters his trajectory. The only reason this isn’t higher is that the initial “inventory” goal doesn’t face any external complication beyond the nostalgia trigger, keeping the structural ambition relatively modest.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal through-line—grief → decision to experiment → planting the seed → the luminous sprout—is clean and coherent in a single-POV arc with a brief, legible time-lapse. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she gains a new understanding of death-as-transition, validated by the physical response of the seed. The drive lens feels Accumulative/Textural, and the story maintains that lens consistently. The main limitation is that the plot’s stakes remain largely conceptual, without a moment where failure or danger reconfigure options in a sharper way.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean ritual arc: assess the creel → tide rises/identity migrates → smelting → return of serenity, giving solid accumulative closure. The decisive change is the reconfiguration of raw memory-ore into peaceful smelt and the return to the Archivist stance, with the cost embedded in the act of smelting. Stakes are more conceptual than dramatized—there’s little sense of what happens if the ritual fails—so the structural elegance isn’t matched by high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: inspection → discovery of the chamber and protocol → realization of the pearl’s nature → decision to subvert the bunker’s intent → activation that reconfigures the system into a beacon. The drive lens reads as primarily Causal with an Accumulative texture; the ending’s Decisive Change (repurposing the bunker) and Resonant Reconfiguration are both on the page. Stakes and options are legible, and the choice at the pillar clearly forecloses the “safety-through-separation” path. The only miss is that external consequences of this reversal are left abstract, so cost is more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece tracks cleanly as a single-scene pilgrimage: arrive at station → search → discover graffiti → reframe guilt → leave accordion. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: his understanding of map/territory and his relationship to guilt shift, with a concrete act of leaving the instrument behind to mark the before/after. Causality is simple but intact; each beat grows from the prior one. The only ceiling is that the graffiti’s perfect aptness feels mildly convenient, slightly softening the sense of hard-won discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: the first letter leads her to the library, the watch provides a method, decoding accumulates until the climactic “Stay,” and this knowledge reconfigures her stance toward the impending second letter. The structure is a focused single sequence that tightens as she approaches the “central chamber,” with no orientation debt. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she cannot change the letters, but her options and understanding are reweighted in the final image. Stakes and rules are consistent, though the world’s mechanics remain lightly sketched rather than deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: tasked with myth-making, he touches the vine, receives contradictory evidence, consults his coffee ritual, then makes a decisive, costly choice. The piece fits a tight single-scene arc with one clear escalation and a solid closure unit (Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration). The looming solstice address provides a light temporal frame even if not fully exploited as a ticking clock. Nothing important teleports or gets retroactively patched, and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: single scene, clear beginning (soul on slab), middle (search and infusing), and end (archiving the gem) with a legible before/after. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds modestly through the focusing on one “perfect chord” and the infusion moment. Closure is solid as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the soul is gone, a fragment preserved, the grotto’s hush reweighted. Stakes remain small-scale and untested by any true risk of failure, which keeps the arc from feeling fully climactic.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: dimming Heart-Bloom → diagnosis of sluggish water → vantage in the tree → decision to reshape the soil → successful revival and internal shift. Structure is straightforward single-scene with one reflective layer that stays anchored in the present. Closure lands as a meaningful reconfiguration of her role and understanding, though the lack of any serious on-page risk or complication keeps the plot from feeling fully high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is tight: a single continuous scene from dying campfire through dawn, with a clear because/therefore chain (night of confession → chimes ritual → mirror shard → unhooking the cloak → departure). Closure lands with a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen chooses not to proceed as the man of absolute righteousness he arrived as, and leaves lighter but uncertain. Cost is implicit but real—he surrenders the comforting story of himself as avenger and the visible mantle of status. The drive reads as situational with clean causal beats, and nothing vital is left dangling.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is cleanly structured as one continuous causal sequence (arrival in impatience → demonstration → trance → realization) with no orientation debt. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: what “vanishing” means is redefined, and Kael’s options for pursuing his goal are mentally reconfigured. The cost—releasing the anchor of his desperate wanting—is present but mostly implied rather than tested in an on-page decision. For top-tier venues, one more concrete beat showing immediate behavioral consequence of his new understanding would strengthen the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: discovery of the arrowhead, divination via the birds, then the psychic act that resolves the wandering pulse. Causality holds throughout and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon’s emotional landscape shifts, and Kaelan gains a “first true path.” The drive lens is largely accumulative/textural, with enough causal linkage to keep the throughline firm. What limits it at this level is the relative ease of the resolution—no beat where the process plausibly could fail or exact a sharper on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival → diagnostic attempts → failure → renunciation of tools → contact with keystone → realization. Causality is tight under a Causal lens; each beat follows logically from the last without convenient shortcuts. Closure works as a Conceptual Repricing: he redefines magic and sacredness, with a clear before/after in his stance. The cost is mostly conceptual (relinquishing his culture’s metrics of success), but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story’s structure is clean and legible: lamplighting → preparation → descent → wreck/library → interior realization → resurfacing, with each step causally motivated. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration when he experiences indigo as the color of her music and his promise kept—is on the page and clearly reweights the opening situation. Cost is present (years of fixation, the danger and isolation of the dive), though the external risk is somewhat underplayed and there’s only a single major tightening rather than a more layered build of complications.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: anomalous pattern → risky recalibration decision via coin → near-failure → unexpected “memory” signal → prophecy recollection → conceptual reframing of his role. Closure lands as a strong conceptual repricing: the story’s rules reweight from prophecy-forward to curation-backward, with a clear before/after in Kael’s stance. Stakes and costs (possible sensor burnout, existential purpose) are legible and carried through to the end. Structure stays within a clear single-scene frame, and reflection is always anchored to present action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: present-moment ritual in the observatory, framed by the discovery of the recordings and culminating in the crystallization. Causality is simple but sound (recordings → obsession → attempt to anchor echo → creation of the shard). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he remains heartbroken but is no longer lost because the grief has form and a name. The structure is more meditative than plot-driven, but within that mode the before/after is legible and carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: long set-up of ritual and futility, then a single, decisive adjustment (the silence between drips) produces a concrete, scaled payoff. Causality holds tightly under a mostly causal lens: the 97 days of experiment motivate the final insight, which in turn produces the hum and the first moisture. Closure is solidly on-page with felt cost (spent magic, physical collapse, a tiny but undeniable change in the world). The only limit is that escalation is mostly conceptual/reflective rather than dramatized as on-page trial-and-error within this particular morning.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: drought reveals town → discovery of artifacts → archival search → attic revelation → ledger correction → community exhibit. Structure shifts from atmospheric opening to investigative middle to ethical climax without confusion, and the montage-like research section still feels motivated. Closure is on-page and decisive: the act of “expunging” and annotating the record plus the public display reconfigure the town’s narrative at a visible cost. The only limit is that external resistance to his correction stays mostly implied, keeping escalation largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: long-term blocked project → remembered grimoire passage → starlings’ pattern indicating the tree → crystal → sublimation → internal shift. Structure is simple but effective, with one clear escalation from lab frustration to stepping into the orchard, then to the crystal ritual and reconfiguration. Closure lands as a decisive inner change with a legible before/after in how Elias understands his work and himself. The cost (relinquishing sole reliance on logic, embracing vulnerability and wonder) is somewhat implicit but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: storm ends → new data arrives → pattern is wrong → need stealth recalibration → trembling, then muscle-memory solution → warning sent. The story maintains a single, continuous scene with no orientation issues and a clear midpoint tightening around the power diversion scheme. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the network is re-aimed and the warning dispatched, with the cost expressed in Kael’s drained, hollow aftermath. Stakes and consequences are legible even though the broader fallout remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: ongoing “clone custody battle” → renewed confrontation → Kael’s decision to act → ritual vivification → new consciousness and Kael’s altered internal state. The piece follows a single, continuous scene with no orientation issues and a clear tightening as Kael ignores Jin and commits. Closure lands well: the new mind’s “Query: What is this place?” and Kael’s new sense of responsibility create a decisive before/after in both world and protagonist. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than material but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: mysterious box → research → symbolic inference (Finch) → choice to plant as a long-term puzzle. Structure is simple but effective, with one reflective middle passage that’s anchored and feeds directly into the final action. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid—he commits to nurturing this slow enigma—though the cost is more implied than sharply dramatized. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a thematic overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: prolonged silence → decision to act → repeated attempts to start the blower → sonic haunting through the hallway → wife’s partial emotional thaw and his partial peace. The piece adheres to a single continuous scene with a clear beginning, intensification, and a resonant final beat. Closure lands as a quiet but legible reconfiguration: the household’s frozen grief is minutely but meaningfully shifted. The cost (his strain and the family’s painful re-contact with memory) is implicit but visible enough to work.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: intrusion → pendant → temptation → portal → conscious counter-ritual. Structure is simple but solid, with the repeated “veil of sleep” transitions giving a legible two-shard rhythm that holds a situational/causal lens to closure. The Earned Stasis ending—choosing to stay, killing the pendant—lands with clear cost and before/after reconfiguration. There are no major orientation or rule ambiguities; the only minor limitation is that the cultists’ off-page ritual stays a touch generic and under-specified.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: weeks of failed attempts → mounting loss of the crozier → final fragment → reframed understanding → altered method → transformation. Orientation is excellent—who, where, when, and what he wants are all clear within the opening sentences. Closure lands decisively with a new magical reality and a reconfigured life path; the cost of destroying the relic and abandoning the Guild-defined future is on the page. The design is straightforward rather than structurally audacious, but it’s tightly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: setup of the perigee and overwhelming noise, despair, decision to repurpose the fragment, execution of the new method, and the attainment of the shard of hush. Causality is strong and legible under a mostly causal lens with textural emphasis, and the closure beat clearly reconfigures her options and understanding. The dominant stake—capturing this anomaly tonight—does resolve on the page. The only limitation is that the escalation and resolution feel almost frictionless; nothing seriously threatens to fail once the new approach begins, so cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: ferry slips into unreality → Finn orients, experiments with the radio → realizes the seam → uses patterned static to fuse timelines → they snap back with only his memory altered. Orientation is immediate and the speculative rules (patterns, parallel echoes) stay consistent enough for the ending to feel earned. Closure lands as both a literal return to harbor and a conceptual repricing of Finn’s role in reality. The only limit is that the cost and options at the climax could be sharpened further (we never feel there’s a genuine alternative path).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that escalates from work-in-progress to destabilizing memory shift to the eruption and final reconfiguration of his reality. Causality is solid—altered memory → lattice tremor → intensified weaving → eruption into the kitchen apparition → realization of the cage. Closure clearly functions as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he has “discovered” what he wanted, at the price of imprisoning himself in illusion. The accumulative/textural drive lens holds throughout; nothing important feels unmotivated or retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: alien arrival → Kaelen’s obsession → secret research with edge geometry → pattern discovery → council confrontation and proposal. Structure is straightforward and legible, and the drive lens remains causal throughout. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the city’s self-conception shifts from anchor to first link in a chain, with future expansion implied and the emotional cost (leaving the “complete” world) present if not deeply dramatized. The main limitation is that the opposition (council resistance) dissolves quickly; the decision point is more a rhetorical flourish than a hard-won turn under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear anchors (who/where/when) early, and a tight causal chain from hearing-aid pulses → photograph → locating Leo → reassurance → signal fading. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light accumulative texture, and the closure (the call answered, energy subsiding) lands clearly on the page. Stakes and goal are legible from the outset and never drift. The only limitation is that the cost of Elias’s work remains conceptual rather than concretely dramatized, keeping the closure quiet rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: tide window → entry → blockage → phase transition → hub → insertion of the fleck → release/closure, with a clear before/after. Closure is solidly on the page as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghosts are gone, his haunting relieved. The main structural softness is how quickly and cleanly the phase-transition solution arrives and works, with relatively low on-page cost or complication. The four-hour ticking clock is introduced but not meaningfully tightened in the middle, so situational pressure never fully spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: radio interference clears, she initiates the defragment ritual, hours of failure accumulate, then the star-void diagram and Aris’s single clear message arrive, followed by a reconfigured understanding. Orientation (who/where/when) is quickly and firmly established, and the causal chain is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the discovered “architecture in the darkness” reweights both Aris’s work and Elara’s life with a clear, if quiet, cost—she remains a ghost, but now it has meaning. Escalation is modest and almost entirely internal, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is clean early: who he is, where he is, and what he wants are sharply established. The structure is linear and tight—years of searching lead causally to interpreting the birds, choosing the tower, then aligning the diamond to achieve the silence and first word. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the proof that language lives in matter, not breath, with the canyon’s roar annihilated then replaced by a single “true word.” The cost is mainly conceptual and historical rather than personal risk, but it’s legible and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: assignment → weeks of watching → discovery of grotto → witnessing the ritual → reinterpretation of Clara’s fate → renunciation of his mission and decision to protect the garden. Orientation (who/where/why) is firmly in place early, and the embedded backstory about Clara directly informs the present stakes instead of drifting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he forecloses the path of exposure and attempted “rescue” in favor of guarding the secret at real personal and ideological cost. Structure holds a single-scene window with one deepening turn (the client’s metamorphosis) and one final stance choice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the shell → experimentation → planned confrontation at the Mother Tree → musical act that transforms the orchard and neutralizes the Wardens. Orientation is solid, and the story stays within one continuous causal window. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in the orchard and in Elara’s understanding, and her exhaustion offers a modest but real cost. The structure is simple but well-shaped for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mapping gaps → bottle as tool → timed “corridor of nothingness” → transfer → confirmation, all in one contained scene. Orientation is excellent from the opening (who/where/when are legible), and the closure beat—bluebird confirmation plus his reframed understanding of “where promises heal”—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The main limitation is that the operation proceeds almost too smoothly; no mid-scene hitch or reversal tests the plan, which slightly softens the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: discovery of the fragment, its integration into his routine, the crafted setting for it, and a climactic installation that triggers his song. Causality is solid—each step (finding, choosing to keep, deciding it “belongs” on the mare) leads naturally to the closing transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the nature of silence in his oasis changes from absence to a charged, listening space, with the cost being the surrender of his long-held muteness. Stakes remain small and intimate, but they are fully legible for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that escalates from quiet setup through the experiment to a brief, vivid rupture and a reflective landing. Causality is sound—artifacts and method lead to an attempted warp, which yields a partial vision and then closure in his revised understanding. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from abstract belief to confirmed path at a cost of not yet attaining the goal. Stakes remain more conceptual than urgent, which keeps the piece just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean and causal: long-term ritual → unprecedented foggy sunrise → charged development process → light-painting → manifestation. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the story holds a consistent accumulative/textural drive as each sunrise fragment builds toward the final “cipher” solution. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change—what was an absence becomes a presence—and the emotional stakes resolve without mechanical over-explanation. The only limitation is that the price of the resolution (what it means for his future) remains more suggestive than sharply delineated.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: the mother arrives with the problem, the Locksmith waits for twilight, then performs the ritual that frees the music-idea. Causality is coherent—each step (waiting for the star, using the hair, humming) feels like a logical progression, and the final release clearly closes the central problem. Closure is an on-page reconfiguration: the “lock” dissolves and the woman’s longing is relieved at a cost of letting the son’s symphony leave her personal sphere. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural with causal throughlines, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: anomaly detected → approach → temptation → rule-breaking → limited but potent payoff, with clear causal links. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and cleanly, and the single-scene frame supports the stakes. Closure is solid: he gains a concrete memory and reinterprets his entire life’s work as “finally beginning,” a decisive before/after. The emotional and conceptual cost are present but relatively quiet, which keeps the ending from an even higher impact band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that escalates from observation, to lesson, to dangerous ritual, to a quiet but decisive reorientation. Causality holds—every step (knot, cube, tea-reading, map) arises from the reversible exile premise and Kael’s methods. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara redefines “resilience” and forecloses the impulsive escape route in favor of rebuilding here, and the cost (delaying or risking return) is legible. A hair more emphasis on the concrete logistics of “reversible exile” and return could sharpen the stakes’ causal edge.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: orientation arrives early, the ritual is the central action, and the restoration provides clear closure. Causality is straightforward (greyness → decision to act → essence capture → planting → world renewal) and the piece holds a single, coherent drive from start to finish. However, there are no genuine obstacles or reversals; success feels assured from the outset, keeping the arc from fully tightening. The cost of failure is declared but never concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: feel the disturbance, explain the net and its function, select and unravel a knot, experience the release, then reconfigure the relationship by passing the needle to Kaelen. The causal chain is intact and legible under a mostly causal lens with accumulative texture: unrest spikes as the knot is worked, then eases when the knot releases. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise—the burden of thousands of remaining knots now explicitly includes Kaelen, and the cost shows in the narrator’s exhaustion and the “night” just beginning. The piece does not attempt a second major turn, but at this length that single tightening and cadence shift is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: obsession with the torn map → research → archives → film comparison → lichen anomaly → reinterpretation of the map’s tear. Structure is tight and linear, with a single transition from workshop to archives and back, and the drive lens reads as largely causal with a textural, contemplative surface. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the tear becomes a threshold, reweighting every prior detail of damage, preservation, and omission. The cost—recognizing the map as an interface with the unknown rather than something she can repair—is implicit but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: sonar find → descent → discovery of globe and cylinder → reading the note → conceptual and ethical decision about the globe. The piece lands a genuine closure beat via conceptual repricing: her understanding of “letting go” shifts, and she chooses renunciation (leaving the globe) with a legible cost. Structure is tight for the length, with one temporal shift back to the surface that’s clear and purposeful. The only limit is that external stakes remain low-tension, so escalation is more intellectual than felt, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual framed tightly by the lightning–thunder window, with clear causal flow from preparation to near-failure to reply. Orientation is excellent; who/where/what is happening is anchored early without clunky exposition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghostly flower and warm plate confirm successful contact and reweight the opening sorrow, though the cost remains relatively gentle. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds consistently, with each step thickening the emotional field rather than delivering sharp plot twists.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: elevator ascent → encounter with encrypted diary → use of goggles → discovery of the child → decision to guard the secret, all within a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of Elara’s life (tragic captain → desperate mother) plus Kael’s earned stasis in choosing to keep that knowledge private, with clear before/after. The structure is tight and well-scoped for the length, with the elevator floors giving a light scaffold. The only brake on a higher score is that external stakes remain modest and the cost of his final choice is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: the cloud-cataloguing builds toward the noctilucent fractal that confirms his hypothesis and reframes his situation. Causality is simple but coherent—profession → belief → method → discovery → reconfiguration—and orientation (who/where/what happened) is established early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he recognizes “The Unbroken Spool” and accepts a new role. The main limitation is the lack of any structural complication or tightening beyond that single, beautiful deepening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: coin → lock → obsidian stone → tree heart → sky, all under a demolition clock. Orientation is excellent from the opening paragraph; we always know where we are, what she must do, and why it matters. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library becomes an enclosed cosmos at the moment of its physical erasure, with a conceptual cost (beauty preserved only as the container dies). The main limitation is how smoothly everything succeeds—there’s little sense that failure ever truly threatens the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: puzzling over the hopscotch board → realizing it encodes temporal instructions → reading the starlings as a map → locating the luminance. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph, and the single POV/scene holds without confusion. Closure lands via a conceptual and status change—his discovery and reframed understanding of the luminance—though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than materially or relationally felt. Because the stakes are primarily intellectual, the final “before/after” is satisfying but not deeply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: prophecies → arrival at the core → vial uncapped → key revealed → Orrery restored, all within a single coherent scene. Orientation (who/where/what) lands early, and the drive lens—causal, with a mythic overlay—holds consistently. Closure is decisive and on-page: the machine moves from stasis to motion, and Elara’s life-purpose reconfigures from quest to fulfillment. The main limitation is that the journey to this point is summarized rather than dramatized, so the resolution feels slightly pre-ordained instead of hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious message → reexamination → resource find → further messages → discovery of bell → diagram → climb and resonance → cleared flight path → departure. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the story sustains a single, legible drive toward escape with a decisive change when the planet’s magnetosphere is retuned. The closure is solid but relatively cost-light in the present tense; most hardship is backdated rather than paid on the page at the climax. Still, structure is efficient, with no serious gaps or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clearly anchored in place and time, with a defined before (ripple impending) and after (pane dissolves, white silence). Causality is straightforward—he prepares, initiates the lullaby via the crystal, exhausts himself, and the world ends—but coherent under an accumulative/situational lens. Closure is strong Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he finishes his task, spends his essence, and embraces the peace he’s granted others, with legible cost in his fading consciousness. The main limitation is that options never feel meaningfully in doubt; the path is singular and unchallenged, which keeps the arc from feeling more dynamically shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: horn → retrieval of box → assembly of beacon → disruption of birds → traveler’s escape → spent nut and exhaustion, giving a clear before/after with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never wavers, and the single-scene structure fits the scope. Closure is solidly on-page via the cracked nut and Elias’s return to his shack under full frost, an earned stasis rather than a mechanical wrap-up. The plot is efficient but a bit linear, with minimal complication once the decision to build the beacon is made.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: walking the ravine → chrysalis → river foam → insight, all causally and emotionally linked. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines divergence and reframes his relationship with Lena, with a concrete forward action (how he will start his next letter). Stakes are internal but coherent and scaled to the length, and there are no orientation or causality slips. It stays a quiet, single-beat scene, but within that scope the before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: shop → orchard investigation → discovery of the blank tree → incision and moonlight → return to shop with reinterpreted purpose, with clear because/therefore links. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural—his measurements of absence build toward the silent core tree—yet causality also holds: his method yields a path that leads to the central object. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (what a beginning is), on-page, through the decisive act of cutting and filling the tree. The main limitation is that the cost of this act (what is irreversibly lost or risked) remains implied rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong: rain → puddles → fossil → memory-map → discovery of the pavilion → decision to subsume remorse → transformed return, with no major gaps. Closure is both a decisive change (his curse lifted, pavilion dissolved) and a resonant reconfiguration of his life with real, felt cost. The structure—fortress, desert excavation, pavilion, return—is clean and legible with a single POV and no orientation issues. Escalation flows logically from private craft to world-scale act without resorting to arbitrary new rules.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: cacophony → calibration ritual → critical adjustment → harmony, with clear because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the grain elevator network shifts from isolation to harmony, with Elias’s exhaustion and the “never truly finished” note providing cost. The causal chain is straightforward and legible, if a bit low on genuine uncertainty or risk. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene moving from preparation to plunge to altered aftermath, with causal beats that are easy to track. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she emerges changed, now housing the composer’s dream with a clear before/after line. The risk of failure/self-loss is stated and gestured at (“storm of ghosts,” “threatening to pull her under”) but never quite manifests as a concrete near-miss, so the climax feels slightly less tested than it promises. The accumulative/textural lens holds, but escalation could use one sharper hinge where the outcome genuinely seems in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline—Inversion begins → Kael enters → navigates to wall → decodes pattern → flees as gravity rights itself—reads clean and coherent. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early, and the gravity-inversion rule is consistent and paid off at the climax. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he has gained dangerous knowledge and now bears an ongoing cost. The intellectual-plague frame is mostly told rather than enacted, so the global stakes feel a bit abstract compared to the concrete grotto sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene in which Elara discovers the Old One’s method and escalates into a full-grove performance that reconfigures her relationship to silence. Causality is coherent and accumulative under a textural lens—learning the stress-crack “score” leads to new tactics, which culminate in the grove-wide symphony and the charged final silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: silence shifts from absence to attentive presence, with a felt emotional cost. The only limitation is that pressure never seriously threatens failure, so the arc reads as a graceful unfolding rather than a hard-won, high-stakes turn.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival in tense expectation, methodical observation, conceptual breakthrough, then the visible manifestation and emotional reconfiguration. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—his correlation and pattern-reading lead directly to his ability to read the “next phase” when it arrives. Closure is a solid Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: exile is reweighted as access to a deeper beauty, with the stone drop as a decisive act. Stakes remain primarily internal and contemplative, but for this scale the arc is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.7)
    Structure is clean: single scene, clear goal (recover the grandmother’s silence), rising pressure from the impending fireworks, and a satisfying closure when the clasp opens and he shelves the diary under a thematically charged label. Causality works well—his memory of her and his intuitive leap with the dial are motivated and pay off without contrivance. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine; the escalation is modest but coherent. Cost at closure is present conceptually (honoring privacy, choosing feeling over content) but could be made more viscerally legible to push the structural effect higher.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: calm preparation, then the turning of the “tide’s thought” as a single strong escalation, then a clear internal reconfiguration. Causality is solid: the rare seed raises the stakes; the seasonal wind shift triggers a crisis for someone with her nose; her response leads to a new stance toward her goal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis when she redraws her ambition as “a quiet partnership” and centers the still point on her own inner soil. The cost—pain, overwhelm, and the foreclosed path of sensory avoidance—is present but could be edged into slightly sharper, less abstract consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: gravity inversion opens a window → water-river path → arrow-tip guidance → discovery → shard extraction → return with reweighted knowledge. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the single continuous scene structure fits the length. Closure is solid—a Conceptual Repricing where the “cure” becomes “memory of strength”—but the cost is mostly implicit (time pressure, risk) rather than dramatized as a specific sacrifice or irreversible loss. The drive lens (causal quest) holds consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: investigation → patch discovery → reframed hypotheses → refined modeling → reconstructed catastrophe → conceptual and emotional closure. The piece sustains a single, coherent drive and culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he attains perfect knowledge at a terrible, irreversible cost. However, the core catastrophe is delivered in a single dense expository block, a touch “explainer” in feel rather than fully dramatized. Even so, the structural arc and closure are strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: the sculptor’s first strike triggers Kael, who performs the ritual that dissolves the sculpted hush and reawakens wonder, with clear before/after. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural—pressure builds via sensory density rather than reversals—but the closure is a solid resonant reconfiguration of the world’s state. However, there’s little sense of contingency or real risk; his success never seems in doubt, and no constraint complicates the performance once it begins. The ending lands conceptually but with minimal on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal sequence is clean: preparation → uncasing the relic → playing in a new way → realization/closure, all in one continuous scene. The inferred lens (largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine) holds, and the ending provides a clear conceptual shift about what guardianship actually meant, with felt cost. Stakes are primarily internal, but the story does manage a before/after boundary in his understanding. Structure is solid if conventional, with no major surprises or structural risks.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one contained ritual scene from arrival to card, with a clear before/after in Anya’s relation to her grief. Causality holds—her request leads to the procedure, which yields the card and conceptual reframing. The closure operates as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the grief remains but is reweighted via the symbol, with a legible cost. Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, and nothing in the structure undercuts the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear trigger (pendant activation), a central magical event, and a reconfiguring aftermath. Causality is intact and legible—aurora → pendant vibration → time-extended encounter → garden of crystals → Kael’s reframed understanding. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: his work and Elara’s disappearance are reweighted with emotional cost (letting go of the “routine” frame). Stakes remain modest and internal, but at this length that focus is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and causal: years of failed attempts → rare meteorological/temporal alignment → meticulously staged experiment → specific, devastating revelation. The global drive lens is Causal with a Conceptual Repricing closure, and it holds tightly from setup to the final line. The accident report bolt diagram is an excellent payoff of seeded information (the wreck, his salvaging of the prism) and reframes all prior effort. Stakes and cost are clear at the end, with no orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: long-term backstory of weaving and sacrifice funnels into a single scene of recommencement and completion. Causality is intact and legible—each golden thread erases a memory, leading to the climactic choice to finish the tapestry and embed the bead. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she has achieved her goal but at the cost of her remembering why, and the final image reweights everything that came before. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues, and the “before/after” is sharply drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: dying arches → magician’s relic → deciphered notes → descent → sacrifice → visible planetary response. The structure (surface → shaft → cavern → return to sky) is classical and easy to follow, with a clear closure beat when the arch stabilizes. The “bartered awakening” ritual is explained just enough to feel motivated without over-explaining. The main limit is that opposition is largely environmental and conceptual rather than dramatized as obstacles or reversals within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: cyclic phenomenon → shard use → layered visions → discovery of the true cause of Elara’s “accident” → choice to redirect the cascade → quieted bay and completed map. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the piece sustains a single coherent scene with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost (losing access to the echoes and any hope of further contact), though the ease with which he manipulates “a river of raw power” slightly softens the sense of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: long-standing routine → light goes out → urgent trip through the storm → discovery of the keeper’s departure → repair and farewell. Orientation is excellent, with who/where/when established early, and the squall/lamp failure is a crisp inciting incident. Closure lands solidly with the repaired lamp and the farewell stone circle as a resonant reconfiguration of his bond with the keeper. The only limit is that the middle conflict (reaching and fixing the lamp) proceeds almost too smoothly, with little complication beyond weather.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean ritual structure: storm approaches, apparatus engages, storm is shaped, dawn arrives, and the final insight reweights what came before. Causality is clear and there’s a legible before/after in how Kaelan understands his role, satisfying closure via conceptual repricing. However, the middle lacks a distinct structural turn beyond “bigger storm, more intensity,” and the stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete jeopardy or difficult choices. This flattens the arc just enough to feel short of immediate high-end publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: transplant → curiosity → sustained observation via sun trails → confrontation → conceptual repricing about prisms and stories. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, why) and the accumulative/textural drive is maintained without confusion. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing: he reinterprets both the woman and his donor heart, with a before/after in how he sees light and stories. The cost is quiet but legible—his old, “steady” existence has been traded for an unsettling, permanent change in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: sound → discovery of shard → analysis → unprecedented sorrow reading → lightning/mootlight intervention → integration into mosaic. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure early, and the piece stays in one continuous, legible scene. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and closure is a resonant reconfiguration: grief moves from chaotic, jagged despair to integrated, archived acceptance. The price is conceptual rather than dramatic—Aris’s role as custodian of sorrow is reweighted, but stakes never intensify beyond the contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: fractured memory → tending the greenhouse → song fragments → full Canticle → woven sun → renewed tree and first dawn. Structure is linear, well-contained in one scene, and the closure is on-page and legible as a decisive change and a resonant reconfiguration of the world. The main weakness is the relative ease of success—no real setbacks or complications threaten the plan once the goal is known, so escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: invitation → regret and search for “emotional alchemy” → intrusion (click of the door) → use of the hiding technique → observation of Elara → reconfiguration of his belief. Causality is coherent under a situational/accumulative lens, with each new stimulus (especially Elara’s entrance) tightening his internal stakes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: his stance toward solitude and connection is reweighted, with the invitation left as a quiet, costly token of change. The cost (remaining physically absent while opening internally) is subtle but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is clean: one scene framed by reflective context, with a clear escalation when the Civic Patrol arrives and a quiet but legible closure when he walks away and her sense of the silence shifts. The causal chain—decay → her gardening → patrol intervention → mutual recognition—holds under an accumulative/textural lens, and the bread heel/payoff is well-seeded. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she continues her path, now seen, with a felt emotional cost and modest consolation. Stakes remain small-scale and intimate, but they are coherent and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and coherent: retrieve object → activate apparatus → struggle as it fails → capture final datum → aftermath, with each step causally linked. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: pressure builds as the vow’s light degrades and options narrow toward a single captured tone. Closure is solid via conceptual repricing—the vow’s extinction reweighted as an equation that is both tombstone and seed, with a clear sense of before/after cost. The scene stays in one continuous window with no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: initial observation → escalating failed interventions → final tactic that reconfigures the situation. The single-scene structure is tight, with each false start narrowing options and leading logically to the lie about the fob’s flaw. Closure is solid: the deal collapses, Silas is cast out, and Elara achieves her recording at a cost to him and with implied risk to herself. The only constraint keeping this from the very top band is that the time-pressure (“before the first rays of sun”) is more atmospheric than structurally active.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: arrival on the bluff → sensing the carriers → convergence → auroral absorption → conceptual shift, all under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality holds (her method detects carriers; the aurora-event silences their compasses; she revises her understanding), and the closure unit is a conceptual repricing with clear before/after. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and experiential, so the turns register more as deepening pattern than escalating dilemma. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues, but the lack of tactical choices undercuts intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: the hollowing laughter leads him to the sanctuary, the painting reframes from depiction to diagram, which then enables the lock’s opening and the reveal of tools, not treasure. Closure is solid—a decisive change in his understanding of what Anya left him and what he must do. The cost is mostly conceptual and retrospective (lost years, past failure); there’s little sense that failure here would materially alter his options, so structural stakes feel modest. Still, for a quiet, single-scene piece, the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: floorboard → shredded map → postal plate as key → hidden vault → Veritas seeds → decision to plant, with no major logic gaps. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the closure—a conceptual and practical reorientation of his role—lands clearly. The cost is more implied than dramatized; there’s no significant sacrifice or obstacle in physically reaching or using the vault. As a result, the ending feels satisfying but slightly low-pressure for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: commission arrives → work on sculpture → wait for precise wind → symphony plays → sculpture self-destructs → Elian accepts result and looks to the next task. The accumulative/textural drive is apt, with the build toward the updraft and crescendo giving a coherent arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fading oceanic truth is renewed at the price of the sculpture, and Elian settles into a new, earned stasis. Stakes and costs resolve on-page without confusion, though the path feels smooth and almost entirely uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: magnetic shift → seizing the opportunity → retrieving and opening the box → chaotic escalation → miniaturization → structural burn → step into the desert. Closure is decisive and on-page: the static is transformed into a jewel and the caretaker exits the “perfect, static garden.” Stakes and costs (diverting life support, risking detection, abandoning the enclosure) are legible, even if not dwelt on. Structure fits a single-scene arc without dead beats or confusing elisions.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: locked mailbox → threat of drilling → Elias chooses to listen → neighbors’ stories yield clues → locket unlocks box → Mrs. Gable’s wish reshapes the courtyard’s future. Orientation is excellent from the outset (who/where/what problem) and the story holds a consistent causal lens through to closure. Closure is solid: the decisive change is the box opening and the community’s reorientation from bureaucratic intrusion to honoring Eleanor’s legacy, though the felt cost remains modest. The official envelope being “forgotten” offers a nice conceptual repricing of what truly matters without straining plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and causal: opaque cipher → embodied thinking via dance → realization about chance → use of dice + poem → liberation. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the mother’s consciousness coalesces and the lab’s ambience shifts. The cost is conceptual—Elara relinquishes control and accepts randomness—but it is legible and earned. A slightly stronger articulation of what failure would mean (beyond implication) could heighten structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal progression is clean: whale → warped gravity → Silas’s method → locating a pocket → partial retrieval → renewed mission. Orientation is strong from the opening, with who/where/when and the beached whale context laid in early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he pays the cost of only regaining a fragment, but his understanding of what’s possible—and thus his path forward—changes. The structure is linear and functional rather than surprising, but fully coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: she prepares, performs the working, and confirms success in a single continuous scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors. Causality holds—her mapping of silence logically precedes and enables the hush—and the closure (prophecy muted, tension deferred) is legible. However, the absence of complication or setback makes the progression feel almost procedural, with limited sense of narrowing options or risk. The “fragile blanket over a dangerous fire” adds a faint after-cost but doesn’t fully tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal throughline—from sugar borrowing to lessons, to the seal, to the rooftop interrogation—is clean, with each step logically arising from the last under a causal/accumulative lens. The closure is strong: the revelation of Elias as the building’s memory and Clara’s acceptance of stewardship provide a clear before/after with conceptual cost (the loss of comforting denial). Structure is tight for the length, with one major temporal compression (summary of weekly teas) that reads efficient rather than evasive. There are no unresolved set-ups or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: garden → structures → shell activation → memory intensification → decision point → full reclamation. Stakes and goal are established early and the piece maintains a single, coherent scene anchored in his attempt to undo the quarantine. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: he chooses wholeness over safety and his status shifts from haunted-by-void to integrated-with-loss. The only limitation is that the emotional and practical costs of this choice feel somewhat contained and tidy for such a drastic act.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves causally from preparation → exposition of the glyph → execution → aftermath. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph (who, where, why) and the causal chain from his secret study to the precise act is legible. Closure lands as a decisive change in the world’s rules (the Covenant’s meaning is altered) and a conceptual repricing of “treason” into a kind of reverence, with the cost implicit in the risk and the weight he bears. The only modest limit is the absence of any complicating turn once the plan is in motion—no setbacks or disruptions test the plan structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: question → descent → encoded messages → crystal revelation → purposeful final song → reconfigured understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: echoes shift from possible ghosts to “cosmic debt,” and her purpose changes on the page. Stakes are internally scaled but coherent; there are no causality breaks or orientation issues. The progression is somewhat linear and unsurprising, but structurally sound and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong: the snow globe’s signal → dream-diving reconnaissance → assembling cameos → engineered shared dream → confrontation → release. Orientation is clean from the opening image of the ice shrine through to the research outpost simulation, with one central throughline (freeing the boy/exposing the man). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the globe transforms from prison to memorial, and Elara’s stance toward her work subtly shifts. The only limiter is that the conflict resolves relatively smoothly once the shared dream is created, with little risk of failure or disruption at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: parapet contemplation → descent along moon paths → immersion among fireflies → whistle attempt → return and revaluation of tools. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: his understanding that “this appreciation…was effort enough” clearly reweights all prior images. Causality is simple but sound—each action grows organically from the last, and there are no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the cost at closure is more conceptual and gentle than sharply felt, which keeps the overall structural impact just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: orchard anomaly → superstition → research station → shredded letters → antenna alignment → stillpoint reveal. The structure (a brief setup, then three days of reconstruction, then the rooftop climax) is tidy and easy to follow, with a clear investigative spine and on-page closure via conceptual repricing. The main weakness is that the resolution feels almost frictionless: no real obstacles or competing pressures interfere with Kaelen’s process. The cost at closure is intellectual rather than dramatically felt, which slightly blunts impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: isolation and listening → gathered fragments and a following → intensification via the Great Storm and dueling ultimatums → discovery of the map → third-path broadcast → storm break. Closure is solidly on-page with a decisive change in both stance and world-state (storm ending, sun breaking through). The chest unlocking at the critical moment leans on convenience, and the scale of the solution (one broadcast resolves vast metaphysical pressures) slightly softens felt cost, but the structure remains coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: dawn → discovery of the music box → gathering of sounds → performance → quiet reconfiguration. Under a textural drive lens, the escalation in density of collected sounds and their release around the box forms a clear closure unit, with a felt before/after in the loft’s silence. Causality is simple but coherent—each step follows from his established practice and the box’s brokenness. The cost is mostly existential (time, solitude, the weight of attending to “small, daily sin”) rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discordant hum → recognition of threat to the Heart → retrieval and use of the key → excruciating vibrational matching → neutralization. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (who, where, and what she’s doing are all legible), and the single-scene structure suits the scale. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change in situation (threat nullified) and a visible cost (her exhaustion), under a coherent causal lens. The only limitation is that the consequences of failure remain somewhat abstract, so the felt external cost ceiling never fully rises.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: long preparation → necessary weather and celestial alignment → harmonic disruption → signal → severing of the network, with no dropped threads or rule-breaking shortcuts. Orientation (who, where, when, what the viaduct is) is fast and solid, and the single-scene structure suits the scale. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus internal reconfiguration: the Authority’s hum stops, and her impatience is transformed into a settled stance. The main constraint for a higher score is that on-page cost remains mostly implied—city-side consequences and any immediate backlash are elided.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: a single, continuous investigation in the tunnel moves causally from initial examination → first uncanny jolt → intensifying visions with the train → notebook discovery → interpretive decision and report stance. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid within the first paragraph, and the causal throughline—that the environment and objects draw Elias into a deeper reading of Finch’s death—holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the death is “preventable” in a psychological, narrative sense, and Elias alters his report accordingly, with a clear before/after in his compliance to Fletcher. Stakes are modest but coherent, centered on truth vs. institutional convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Arthur’s visit with the heart prompts Elias’s analysis, which in turn reconfigures Arthur’s understanding and choice to leave the heart behind. The story sustains one continuous scene with a clear beginning (arrival), middle (interpretation/reframing), and end (Arthur’s new stance and exit). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of Arthur’s vocation, with a felt cost in relinquishing his imagined control over souls. The stakes are modestly scaled but coherent, and there are no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and causal: long ritual → deciphering “Grip” → feverish redesign → leap/test → new law of the world enacted. Closure is clear and earned: he moves from chasing a theoretical pattern to manifesting it physically, with the decisive change being the glider gripping reality itself. Stakes and cost (potential death in the acid sea, permanent solitude with no one to witness) are legible, though the emotional price of that solitude is underplayed at the end. Within the short length, the arc holds together tightly without dangling threads or contrived turns.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: obsession → clue in corrupted files → recurrence of numbers → coordinate realization → security tension with Kael → breach of the Void and whistleblower reveal → release. The drive lens is clearly causal, and the final act of forwarding the data is a decisive change with implicit cost. Structure is tight for the length with no confusing jumps or orientation issues; the “Void” reveal lands cleanly as a recontextualization of “deleted” vs “buried.” The only thing holding it back from the very top is that the institutional response/consequences remain off-page, slightly softening the felt immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: accusation → Kael’s investigation via mirror → recovered past → public reframing → communal de-escalation. The structure holds to one continuous situation with a purposeful brief excursion indoors, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of knowledge and blame. The cost—Mara’s vulnerability and the community’s confrontation with ongoing fragility—is legible on the page. Nothing crucial feels retrofitted or withheld; the magic rule (mirrors + quartz) appears and is used consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: debris-trawling and reflection lead to the calving event, which provides the closure image and answers her core quest. Causality is simple but coherent—her volunteering puts her at this marina at this moment, and the sound delivers the conceptual payoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes death as a “quiet, dignified severance” and her future clinic visit as an already-settled path. A slightly sharper sense of immediate practical stakes or a more concrete cost at the end could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene framed by the departing bus and deepening reflection that culminates in a reframed understanding of the past. Causality is modest but coherent—memories and analogies arise from concrete present cues (vines, windbreak, letter fragment) and lead to a conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Closure is clear: he moves from guarding against the memory to tending it, an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing that marks a before/after. The piece leans accumulative/lyric rather than plot-driven but maintains a legible throughline without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: misinterpretation at the pavilion → decision to act → journey to the marker → descent and use of the parapet → successful consecration → return with altered stakes. The drive lens reads Causal with a quiet, almost ritualistic escalation that still maintains a clear before/after. Closure is solid: once the echo is sealed, the outer debate is genuinely reweighted, and the last image acknowledges that change. The main limitation is that obstacles are largely procedural and easily solved, so the structure feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—return visits, growing photo collection, and climbing vines—builds coherently toward the completion of the mosaic and his departure. The causal chain is soft but legible: factory closure → community pain → Elias’s ongoing project → final healing image. Closure lands cleanly with the completed spiral and his packing up, though the cost remains more conceptual than personally felt. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: discovery of the crystal, weeks of listening, pattern recognition, then the decision about what to do with that knowledge. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the slow build of auditory fragments toward a conceptual realization works, and the closure (choosing testimony over writing) provides a clear before/after. Causality is mostly “he does X, therefore perception deepens,” with no serious breaks or unkept setups. The cost of his final stance is implied more than dramatized, but the story still lands a coherent resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: leave junkyard → follow driftwood markers → reach basalt slab → fail to recall sigil → choose to draw a simple circle instead, which yields a resonant internal climax. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: each environmental and sensory escalation brings him closer to the nexus and heightens the cost of his forgetting. Closure is strong Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—he abandons the original capturing goal and revalues presence, with the felt price of failure and transience. The plot’s simplicity works, but a slightly sharper sense of what would happen if he failed (beyond internal disappointment) could heighten structural tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: spinning clock hand → gravitational resonance → structural threat → need to “restructure the anchor” → sacrifice of the lens → frozen-instant resolution. Orientation (who/where/what’s wrong) is established early and maintained, and the story obeys its own temporal-physics logic well enough for this length. Closure is strong: the station shifts from precarious motion toward destruction to a “beautiful, silent prison,” a decisive change with conceptual and practical cost. The only limit is that the temporal mechanics are gestured at rather than deeply grounded, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and coherent: diagnosis → Elara’s goal → call to Lena → atmospheric preparation → reunion → death. The structure is simple but effective, with one main turn (Lena’s decision to come) and a clean closure in Mr. Aris dying hand-in-hand with his daughter. Some key pressure points—especially the persuasion phone call—are summarized rather than dramatized, which trims complexity from the central turn. Still, the story lands a resonant reconfiguration at the end without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: post–spoon-bending instability → need to relearn runes → key configuration → automaton activation → conceptual answer about shadows. The structure is one coherent scene with backstory woven in, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing—understanding that shadows invert rather than vanish, with the “loop” explicitly closed. Stakes are intellectual and metaphysical but remain legible and focused throughout. There are no orientation issues, and no major dropped setups or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: past dismissal of the changeling panic → present excavation in Elara’s garden → discovery of the tooth → conceptual realignment and new star chart. The two-shard structure (garden, then study) is legible and the transition is smooth. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: his worldview shifts and he deliberately enshrines the fracture. Stakes are modestly scaled but proportionate to the length and held coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: repetitive polishing plus layered memories culminate in the shard’s transformation and her quiet attainment of purpose. Causality is clean (polishing → increased clarity → exposure to twilight → luminescence), and the final image is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Closure lands: before she is an “earthbound star watcher with no stars,” after she literally holds a star-like light she can share. Stakes and costs remain small-scale and largely internal, but legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene where the garden’s evolving drip pattern leads to Elara’s decision “This was the moment,” which in turn motivates the pendant exchange and reconfiguration of Kaelen’s self-conception. Causality is modest but coherent (her observation → insight → approach → his new option) under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the before/after of fossilized judgment vs living pattern is clear, with emotional cost in her vulnerability and his tentative acceptance. Stakes are intimate rather than dramatic, but fully appropriate to the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: pressure of the current → parade of abandoned ideas → ritual act at the center → easing and re-entry to the desk. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he shifts from failed author of these ideas to their keeper, and the blank page is reweighted as “fertile ground.” Causality within the lyric frame holds—each step feels like a motivated therefore rather than arbitrary vignette. Cost is legible in the burial of his “last piece of untarnished hope,” which forecloses a nostalgic return to a pre-corrupted self.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is clean: one ritual scene with clear temporal anchoring (harvest moon, dawn), a coherent build, and a legible closure where the remedy is achieved and his future task is sketched. Causality is straightforward—song → vine activation → golden stories → restored memory—but the path is so smooth that pressure never tightens in a way that threatens failure. Closure as a resonant reconfiguration works, but the cost is only lightly implied as future labor rather than dramatized in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean and coherent: world fear → listening for a heartbeat → constructing the pattern → infusing starlight → sealing and sending → return to waiting. Causality holds at every step, and the ritual sequence is easy to follow. Closure is a quiet but clear RR/Earned Stasis: one child’s path is secured, and Kaelen recommits to an unending, costly task. The main limitation is that the core process unfolds without complication or surprise once begun, so the arc feels more linear than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: broken mechanism → observational method over time → understanding → redesign → reactivation, with no major logic breaks. The accumulative structure of repeated observation culminating in a single activation beat fits the concept and delivers closure as a resonant reconfiguration (the machine’s rebirth vs. the wounded world). Cost exists conceptually (time, solitude, fragile hope against a ruined season) but is not sharply tested in a specific turning point, so escalation feels steady rather than tightening. Still, for this length and mode, the closure lands clearly and coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: a new burden appears, is processed through a concrete ritual, and the result is added to the mosaic, giving a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—one more stone, one more deepening of the hush, his role reaffirmed with palpable cost but no false finality. Causality is straightforward and legible throughout with no orientation issues. The main limitation is the lack of a real possibility of failure or deviation in the process, which keeps the turn modest.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single present-tense frame (“while the kettle boils”) interwoven with one pivotal memory, all causally marching toward the first cut in the wood. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never falters. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres around the narrowing from sprawling grief to one chosen moment, then to a single carved line. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits the scene with a new anchor object that slightly but decisively changes her options for living with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: scavenging → discovery of the wheel → recovered specific memory → confrontation with the ghost → reconfiguration of purpose. The story lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: he shifts from bargaining for absolution to curating “magnificent failure,” with cost anchored in the acceptance of personal culpability. The mixture of stalled time and memory fragments supports an Accumulative/Causal hybrid lens without confusion. Structural scope is well-judged for the length, with no unkept setups or dropped threads.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal line is clean: discovery of the sextant fragment leads to decoding the hidden grid, which drives the decision to re-route power and activate the ceiling, culminating in a clear conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Structure is tight and linear, with no orientation issues and a satisfying closure unit that reweights the building’s purpose. The cost is more conceptual than concrete, so while closure lands, the felt risk around demolition or personal consequence remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual under an accumulative/textural lens: leave cell → reach forecourt → expose bells → reconfigure relationship to his dream. Causality is straightforward and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with empty hands and a changed stance toward silence. Stakes and pressure remain internal and low-intensity, but the scene tightens effectively toward the sunrise/bells image. All setup elements (coffer, dream, hush) pay off in the ending without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: trained instinct → chosen search zone → salvage → contents → reinterpreted family history. The story stays in a single, continuous scene with a clear temporal frame (night into dawn; radio as clock) and lands a solid Conceptual Repricing closure when the lie is re-read as sacrifice. Stakes are focused on knowledge and legacy, and the final before/after is legible. One could argue for slightly higher overt pressure on the “deadline,” but structure and causality are robust as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece tracks cleanly as one continuous scene with coherent accumulative pressure: rope → fulgurite lens → fog/liminal hour → decoding → recording. Causality is modest but intact, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the knot’s technique becomes a philosophy of perception, then is concretely preserved in the journal. The cost is quiet (time, solitude, mental effort) but legible and integrated with the frame of his vocation. Structure never confuses, and the final return of the harbor through the thinning fog gives a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure—present garden → projection into Elara’s past → return with reweighted understanding—reads cleanly and causally enough under an accumulative/lyric lens. Orientation is strong from the opening paragraph, and the projection transition is clearly signaled by the thread focus. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “healing” and “absence” through Kaelen’s realization and decision to write, with a clear before/after in his understanding. The stakes are modest but appropriate for the mode, and there are no causality or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the egg → painstaking reassembly → constructed incubator → anxious waiting → hatching that reconfigures the world’s relationship to beauty. The piece delivers solid closure via a decisive change and conceptual repricing: a new form of beauty alters the mechanical city’s rhythm and Kaelen’s expectations. Stakes (reviving beauty in a deadened world) are signaled early and paid off in the final image with the machines faltering to listen. Structure is straightforward and efficient for the length, with no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean and satisfying: lagoon → emergency call → choice to focus on the banyan → grafting with the coin thread → return to the lagoon with reweighted symbols. Structure (two lagoon shards bracketing the fire scene) is tight, with the final image clearly reconfiguring the opening’s meaning—this is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Stakes remain intimate but legible, and the cost (relinquishing the coin, accepting uncertain future of the tree) is on the page. There’s no orientation confusion or lens ambiguity; the causal drive holds from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present-time action at the Orrery framed by concise, relevant backstory of research breadcrumbs and timing via the geese. Causality is tight—cosmic alignment → placement of box → rotation/alignment of light → click → fountains’ ghost-water—and closure lands via a clear before/after in the city’s state and in Elara’s “pause.” The drive reads primarily as causal with a lyric overlay, and the ending’s resonant reconfiguration is on the page. Escalation is somewhat intellectual and puzzle-like rather than dramatically pressured, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: a pilgrimage through the nebula garden, encounter with the gear, realization, then reoriented action. Orientation is solid early—who Xylar is, where it is, and what it wants are legible within the first paragraphs. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the pings themselves become the “light” and the garden’s serenity is reinterpreted as expectation, with a new pattern beginning. The main limitation is that the decisive change is entirely internal and smooth, with little sense of constraint or resistance shaping tactics beyond the symbolic dead-end of the Heretic Ancestor’s machine.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-time work on the slate, deepened by patterned returns and anchored by the migration’s progression and the storm’s peak. Causes and effects are coherent—his ritualistic retracing and memory-work build plausibly to the moment where the lines converge and insight lands. Closure is strong: his realization about grief’s “network” reconfigures the premise and is concretized by leaving the nameless slate in the greenhouse and returning to his workshop with a new stance. There are no major orientation or lens issues; the single POV, single primary setting, and clear temporal markers keep the piece legible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: preparation in the tower, transition into reverie of the ridge, then return to the present as the pendulum moves again. Causality is simple but coherent—the annual ritual is framed by the literal pause in the pendulum, and his inner work must complete before motion resumes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he re-emerges with a “profound lightness” and a subtly altered perception of the clock’s rhythm. Stakes and cost are modest but legible within this lyric scale, with no orientation or timeline confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: the found case triggers the obsession, the tapestry investigation produces the map, which reframes the case and resolves the echoes. The structure is a single, coherent scene with past setup folded in efficiently and closure via a conceptual and emotional reconfiguration when Elias “reunites” intention with path. Cost is present but subtle—largely the recognition of a journey that never completed and the acceptance of being its belated custodian rather than participant. As an accumulative, lyric design, it holds together impressively, though the stakes never quite sharpen into a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene on the spire framed around a single decision, with backstory and worldbuilding tightly anchored to the present moment and his current task. Causality is strong under a Situational/Causal hybrid lens: years of modeling lead to isolating one viable path, which forces the now-or-never choice to write. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/incipient Decisive Change when he lowers the quill, with the before/after line (blank vs committed map) clearly legible and costly. The main limitation is that much of the pressure is summarized as already-processed modeling work rather than shown as turns in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean one-night ritual: tune in, receive story, encode, confirm, store, and anticipate passing it on. Causality is coherent and easy to track; the global drive is accumulative/textural, culminating in the conceptual repricing of what it means to preserve stories (“teach dust to tell stories”). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the stack of scores and the final calm breathe as an earned, ongoing stance. The main limitation is the lack of an on-page turn—no new threat or complication sharpens the night’s stakes beyond what we’re told.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Kael’s arrival → the gallery tour → the burning → the scattering in the Stillness Room. The structure escalates smoothly through distinct spaces toward a focused ritual climax, and the ending delivers a clear Charged Poise/RR where the “perfect moment” and its cost are both visible. The only limitation is that the turns are fully anticipated; there’s no structural surprise or complication that forces a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure with interleaved reflection that always ties back to present stimuli (the cog, the girl, the sewers). Under a situational/accumulative lens, pressure coheres around whether Silas will treat his knowledge as missionary or archival, and closure lands as Earned Stasis when he refuses the teaching role at visible cost (confirmed isolation and futility). Causality is simple but sturdy: the discovery of the cog and the girl’s intrusion cause the moment of stance-crystallization. The ending feels complete for this length, though the structural turn is more quiet than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal structure is clean: failure at rehearsal → reflective realization in the library → new method at the next rehearsal → fragile moment of harmony. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after: from chronic dissonance to a first unified note, with the cost of long, unseen labor acknowledged. The drive lens is primarily causal with an accumulative texture; it holds consistently through to the ending. Stakes remain small-scale and intimate, but for this length and scope, the structural arc feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: celestial alignment → explosive growth → tasting reveals poisonous history → decision to prune → transformed plant and hopeful fruit. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and the story holds a tight, one-night arc under a causal lens. Closure is solid—a decisive change in the plant and what it encodes, plus a conceptual repricing of history via the new fruit and seeds—but the road to that closure feels relatively unopposed and straightforward. There are no genuine structural surprises or reversals; the piece executes a well-signaled plan rather than a pressured evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → line at the tower → Lena’s question → Silas’s constrained truthfulness → riddle → conceptual reveal. Structure is straightforward single-scene with one central pivot (Lena solving/accepting the riddle’s implications) and a quiet but legible conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: Silas remains in his booth, but the city’s problem is redefined with a felt cost. Stakes stay largely intellectual and thematic, with little sense of immediate jeopardy or narrowed options, which limits structural intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: present walk → reflective framework of prior acts → heightened action at the white cube → next-evening payoff with flamingo and flowers. Causality is modest but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: her pattern of displacements culminates in the shard placement, which then reconfigures her understanding of what she’s really affecting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she shifts from “sanctifying houses” to “posing questions to occupants”—with the world subtly reweighted by the last images. Stakes are small but legible; nothing important breaks, though the conflict remains quiet and risk-light.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight: initial “righteous” mission → revelation of sanctuary → discovery that the weakness is a lung → decision to bury the poison. The story maintains a single clear drive and lands an on-page decisive change with conceptual repricing (her mission redefined as piracy). Stakes are legible and escalate logically as new information reframes prior assumptions. One more concrete external complication could have heightened pressure, but the structure is sound and closure is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight: endless work → completed proof → calculated roll → rupture → reconfiguration of his relationship to the staircase. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the staircase shifts from pure prison to canvas, at a visible emotional cost. Structure is clean and linear, with no orientation issues and one clear escalatory turn at the proof’s completion. The stakes remain largely internal and philosophical, so the climax reads a shade muted in terms of jeopardy despite its conceptual elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: backstory and reflection are anchored to present stimuli (moonlight, paints) and feed directly into the culminating rooftop action. Causality is straightforward—long preparation leads to the public display, the silence heightens pressure, then the city’s lights answer. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s question is answered on the page with an observable change in the cityscape. The stakes remain modestly scaled but appropriate, so the ending feels complete without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: frozen waterfall → rising extinction dread → council’s passivity → chance trigger (bread) + backstory knowledge → sonic solution → communal action → controlled thaw, with no major logic gaps. Closure is decisively on the page: the waterfall’s roar returns and the people’s options change from slow death to renewed survival, with art reweighted as a practical tool. The threat of catastrophic collapse is convincingly seeded via stress fractures and the elders’ fatalism, giving the resolution real cost if it had failed. The only slight softness is how quickly and neatly the ancient-technique recollection solves a complex physical problem, which feels a bit convenient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: long preparation → tide’s nadir as window → final assembly → lever pull → temporal reversal with a clear before/after. Orientation is excellent from the outset (who/where/when are quickly clear), and the drive lens is primarily causal with a light conceptual overlay. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing (time unmade; entering an “unwritten past”), but the cost remains largely abstract—erasure is mentioned, not felt or tested on the page. The structure is essentially one rising line toward a single act, which works but leaves escalation feeling modest rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal drive is clean: advisor/dictionary → following the funhouse’s path → discovery of the clasp → confrontation with Fear → leverage of the void. The global stake (tricking Fear into revealing its weakness) is paid off directly in the mirror scene, with the “unbosoming” as a clear hinge. Closure is solid: Fear is dissolved, the advisor falls silent, and his relationship to his curse is reconfigured with a legible cost (lonelier, but armed). A slightly more arduous or contingent-feeling struggle in the climax could make the victory less tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal spine is clean: cloud-reading → preparation (drawing the fractal) → storm impact → musical intervention → transformed squall and calm. Closure is a clear Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: the storm passes through his action, and we land on a quiet, recharged image of the raft humming with memory. The main structural limitation is the absence of any serious turn where success feels at risk; the escalation is linear and expected. Still, for this length, one continuous, well-shaped scene with a visible before/after is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: inheritance of artifacts → discovery of pattern language → iterative decoding work → climactic whistle performance → watchers’ response → map revelation and revaluation of the Gate and expedition. Closure lands as a strong conceptual repricing: the entire cosmology (watchers, gate, “lost” expedition, city’s destiny) is reinterpreted in a way that imposes undeniable cost. Structure is straightforward and well-scaled for the length, with reflection always anchored to concrete present actions. The only limitation is that the new goal of “to make them believe him” is posited rather than tested on the page, keeping the ending poised rather than fully transformed in action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one contained scene, clear causal flow from Aris’s approach to Elara’s decision, and a decisive, on-page closure when she hands over the vellum. The drive lens is Causal, and each move in the Ashworth anecdote logically tightens pressure on Elara’s position. Expository history is integrated as Aris’s tactic rather than detached info-dump, keeping the scene coherent. The cost of the final act—trading a century-old peace-myth for truth—is conceptually legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: drawbridge isolates him, he enacts his ritual, a single strong disruption (the inkwell’s loss) spikes pressure, and the hut coda lands closure through renewed purpose. Causality is straightforward and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each step deepening the central stake rather than branching. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he almost loses the tool that embodies his mission, then returns with a sharper sense of vocation and cost. The arc is modest but complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece holds a clean causal chain: blackout → new sensory access → re-examination of prior anomaly → retrieval of the stamp → confirmation → decision about what to do with the truth. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise where Elias alters his trajectory (re-indexing in secret) with implied personal and institutional cost. Structure is single-scene, well-contained, and free of orientation issues. The stakes and consequences remain more conceptual than concretely dramatized, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: obtain and polish the mnemonic gem, ascend to the basilica, witness the dream, and come away changed, with each step logically driving the next. The accumulative structure of isles and memories builds toward a clear closure unit where the dream’s beauty and pain reconfigure his stance toward loss. The final return to the tea garden provides a satisfying before/after contrast and earned stillness. No major orientation or lens ambiguity issues interfere with the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single pressured window while the system cools, with backstory anchored to present stimuli and feeding directly into the current choice. Causality is strong—missile → obsession → overdriven array → coolant trip → brief window → discovery—and the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost. The only limitation is that the external plot remains mostly in the realm of data interpretation, but within that frame the escalation and closure are well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: pilgrim → chip → star-gesture → drone navigation → hidden lens → beam → decoded “font of pure meaning.” Orientation (who/where/when) is established almost immediately and never in doubt, and the scene unfolds as a single continuous, coherent sequence. Closure lands clearly with a decisive unlocking and a reconfiguration of her situation/knowledge, though the price of success feels modest. Structurally, it is solid and immediately publishable, if not structurally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is strong: his unresolved guilt and talent → the driftwood-search method → discovery of the gouged oak → realization of large-scale erasure → new mission. Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines his work from selling lies to restoring stolen truths with evident cost. Structure is clean (terrace → shore → terrace), with one purposeful transition and no orientation debt. The main limitation is that the middle search segment lacks complications or setbacks, making the escalation feel a bit too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, clear goal (successful exchange), and a ritualized sequence (moon timing, lockbox, keys, unlocking) that produces a legible before/after. Causality holds under a situational lens—because they follow the archaic protocol, trust is barely possible, and because he uses the object of his past failure, the closure gains cost. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he completes an exchange without disaster and slightly reweights his past mistake. Still, the on-page path is very smooth—no significant hitch, test, or complication challenges the outcome, which flattens structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with clearly anchored who/where/when and a tight focus on one dominant problem: will he keep fleeing the sea or turn toward it. The backstory of the misplotted ship integrates causally, not as a digression, and sets up the present paralysis. Closure lands cleanly as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses continued avoidance by facing the water with the compass in hand. Stakes remain internal and quiet, but the before/after is legible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: archive search → breadcrumb coordinates → descent → cavern → letter → reoriented goal, with no missing links or unkept setups. The structure moves from external investigation to deep interior confrontation, and the closure functions as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise: he explicitly reframes his quest from recovering a past to constructing a future. The cost—accepting that he irrevocably harmed someone and can’t remember it, yet must live under that knowledge—is legible on the page. Transitions are economical and orientation is solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single ritual scene that moves from preparation to peak to aftermath, with clear causal links (fortune → plan → ritual → transformation → new bond). Closure is strong: he irrevocably changes and the bond is reconfigured, not restored, with a clear before/after. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative (sensory and emotional density building through the ritual) with enough causal logic to feel grounded. Stakes and cost are legible at the end, though a small on-page complication or near-failure beat could heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain from birth → anxiety → ritual failure → cloudbound pilgrimage → symbolic release is clean and easy to follow. Reflection is well anchored in present stimuli (saucer, cloth) and always tilts the current moment rather than stalling it. Closure lands as a decisive internal change (abandoning the “lost time” quest) with visible on-page action (dropping the cloak, tracing her hand) and a felt cost. The structure is linear and relatively simple, but fully sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: the repeated ritual with the photographs escalates toward the decisive confrontation with her own image. Each step follows logically—tool, method, cost, mastery—culminating in the opening of the locked dimension. Closure lands clearly on the page with a decisive change (dimension opens; her role completes) and a visible emotional cost. The causal logic of the world’s metaphysics is internally consistent and taught through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: walk → detour via shell → discovery of the circle → release of bugs → volcanic/stellar response → quiet aftermath, all under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality holds—his detour and release are necessary for the prophecy to complete and the mountain to be soothed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he has a before/after relation to transformation, and the volcano’s “heartbeat” has palpably changed, though the cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatically tested. The legend/prophesy is introduced just in time to frame the climax, but it remains graceful rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → Kael’s decision to act → sundial unlocking → fort’s light-network reconfigured, with a clear before/after in who effectively controls the fort. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and maintained, and the single-scene structure suits the drive. Closure lands as a Decisive Change in control, though the price and potential fallout remain implied rather than sharply dramatized. Nothing major breaks causality, but the resolution feels almost too frictionless for the scale of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: vision → rising tide/aurora trigger → decision to use star dust → activation of the spiral → diverted wave. Closure is solidly on the page with a clear before/after and a modest cost (“last resort,” promise only “for now”). The piece keeps to a single scene with well-managed backstory shards that tilt the present rather than stalling it. If anything, the resolution feels a touch too smooth, with minimal on-page friction around deploying such a dangerous tool.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: arrival in vigil → discovery of envelope → deliberate one-hour wait with the timer → ping/mask drop → opening → key/negative → decision to leave. The piece holds a consistent Hybrid drive, with the timer providing causal tightening and the storm/setting providing accumulative texture. Closure is solid: he moves from static atonement to committing to a “new, terrifying journey,” a Decisive Change with conceptual and emotional cost. The only limitation is that external stakes remain modestly scaled and largely implied, which slightly mutes the sense of irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: Kaelen enters, recognizes the puzzle, uses the needle card to decode the sundial, fences through the sequence, and triggers the hidden compartment, yielding the scroll. Causality is straightforward and well-motivated; each step follows logically from the previous and from his established skills. Closure is a Decisive Change—he transforms a static philosophical challenge into a physical journey—but the cost is minimal and the stakes remain largely conceptual, so the ending lands as elegant rather than gripping. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a light conceptual repricing of “questions as maps.”

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: solitary ritual → shared mission with Elara → hidden poems revealed → arrival of strangers → offered shelter and collaboration, ending in a newly formed quartet. Causality is tight under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: their work and rumor draw the drifters, and Silas’s choice to welcome them with a poem reconfigures the situation into nascent community. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the before/after—isolated rebuilders vs. a tiny public—is legible. The cost is subtle (vulnerability, risk of discovery) and could be made a hair sharper on the page, but the arc feels complete for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: failing compasses + collapsing realm → deadline → leveraging the film’s glitches as a navigational exploit → portal → decisive step through. The piece achieves closure via a Decisive Change: he abandons the supposed refuge for a hazardous possibility, with the anniversary clock as a charged pivot. Structure is straightforwardly linear and well-contained in a single scene, with no orientation debt or lens confusion. The cost of failure (obliteration vs. being lost) is conceptually present but could be made more concrete to heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: present-tense pressure at the ridge, a concise reflective middle on the Sleepers’ dreams, then a clear ritual climax and aftermath. Causality is tight under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: careful observation of dreams → interpretive reframing → song/planting → felt reweaving of memory. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she chooses an unprovable act in a world that depends on belief. The resolution verges on ease (the ritual “works” immediately), which slightly softens the felt risk and post-choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: bonsai ritual → discovery/decoding of the lace → waiting for the tide-and-wind condition → climb to the bluff and use of the compass → emotional reconfiguration. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens and the closure is on-page with a clear before/after in how he experiences his guilt. The main weakness is lack of real friction or setback; once the condition is met, the ritual proceeds without complication, so the arc feels almost too frictionless for the level of payoff. Still, the beats are legible and well-placed within this length.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is excellent, utilizing an Accumulative lens that transitions effectively into Causal action. The closure is distinct and resonant; the ritual wiping of the pane followed by the decision to pick up the shovel constitutes a Decisive Change that earns the character's new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central plot device—smugglers using ephemeral, weather-dependent frost patterns as a permanent map—strains plausibility and breaks the narrative's internal logic. While the closure unit (the art piece) is structurally sound, the causal bridge relies on "poetic logic" that contradicts the gritty premise of the ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the ritual setup to a vivid visual climax. The closure—the bloom and the resulting peace—lands clearly, though the "intrusion" of memory feels mechanically timed to provide the necessary beat of conflict just before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a convenient travel ability established only at the moment of need, essentially bypassing the physical obstacles of the journey. The resolution is mechanical and overly tidy; inserting the lens solves the central conflict instantly without complication, creating a "button-press" ending that lacks narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path of increasing fortune without a decisive turning point caused by pressure; options expand rather than narrow. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—seeds appear immediately after the promise to plant—which feels convenient and lowers causal credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a complete vignette with legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the lack of an obstacle or complication makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned through narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal drive where the protagonist's established skill (maze-making) provides the solution to the antagonist (the fragment). Closure is a distinct Decisive Change with an undeniable cost—the erasure of the self—landing firmly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.4)
    The causal chain is legible, but the climax relies on fragile logic that breaks the story's gritty tone. The idea that a decade-abandoned carnival still has working electricity and that piles of plush bears can form "impassable barricades" against armed enforcers strains suspension of disbelief. While the closure (sacrificing self for the seeds) is structurally sound, the mechanical execution of the defense system feels too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is strong, with a clear goal and a specific method (collecting absences) leading to a decisive climax. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he seeks the sound of a break but finds the shape of silence. The logic holds under the Causal lens, though the mechanism of the "time ticking in his own blood" (the cells dividing constraint) feels slightly abstract as a plot clock.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible and the Conceptual Repricing at closure (thief to custodian) lands clearly. However, the plot lacks resistance; the "rusted service hatch" removes all tension from the heist, turning the climax into an atmospheric walkthrough rather than a earned sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident (finding the bookmark) coinciding effectively with the structural threat. Closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration of the grief/thaw concept, though the coincidence of the collapse timing is convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on severe contrivances that strain causality, specifically the whispering shell functioning as a GPS without explanation and a working maintenance phone in a decade-old ruin. The connection between a child's plaster cast, a constellation cipher, and a high-tech containment command is logically tenuous and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions effectively as an accumulative vignette, successfully executing the ritual beat with clear orientation and purpose. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, though the cycle's completion feels inevitable rather than driven by a high-stakes decision in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is exemplary: the loop breaks as a direct result of the protagonist's risky choice to interface. The transition from the mechanical repetitive structure to the singular linear moment of the broken loop is logical and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is clean, utilizing the ticket ritual to build pressure effectively. The closure—offering the lens as a reciprocal confession—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that logically culminates the visual motif. The appearance of the cenotaph ticket coinciding exactly with his decision to act is a minor convenience, but the pacing remains tight.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure (cracking the pristine marble) is a resonant, earned conceptual repricing that lands with cost. However, the climax relies on a deus ex machina (butterflies arriving just in time) rather than a protagonist choice in the moment, weakening the causal chain of the victory itself.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear trajectory that successfully lands a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure. The "sideways" realization is legible and recontextualizes the protagonist's worldview with a felt conceptual cost ("irrevocably... re-calibrated"), satisfying the closure requirement under a Situational/Conceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with a defined inciting focus and resolution. However, the climax relies heavily on a convenient magical realism mechanic—water instantly forming legible musical notation—which resolves the central problem too neatly without a commensurate struggle or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structural arc is seamless, moving from the fever-dream opening to the tangible prop and finally to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the central stake. The closure lands with distinct conceptual cost—the permanent loss of certainty—recontextualizing the "swallowed truth" into a sustainable atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where physical action resolves the internal guilt ("swallowed truth"). However, the plot relies on a significant coincidence—the radio show discussing the exact "factory ghost shift" of the location—which acts as a convenient instructional bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from pressure to release with a logical, magical-realist transition. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, offering a temporary but earned stasis that acknowledges the cycle of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure with legible closure, using the eclipse effectively as a pacing device. However, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned; the therapy faces no significant obstacles, making the "healing" moment feel smooth and procedurally generated rather than causally hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story effectively bridges two timelines through the artifact investigation, leading to a solid Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The ending, where Kaelen accepts his role as an "archivist of the ache," creates a legible conceptual cost (the finality of the loss) that lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure (departure) is a valid Decisive Change. The logistics of the "specific cookie" exchange rely heavily on implied off-page compliance by the bakery, straining plausibility slightly, but the causality holds under the story's fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and logical, successfully employing a Causal/Situational hybrid lens where the method directly leads to the resolution. The "refuted by perspective" closure lands well conceptually, though the speed of the entity's collapse feels somewhat convenient. The causal chain holds, but the brevity limits the complexity of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the protagonist's perspective, but the causal mechanism (mapping memories to tune reality) remains abstract. The resolution hinges on a sudden epiphany that resolves the "missing bridge" without a tangible price beyond generic stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    The loop structure and orientation are handled well, providing a clear narrative arc. However, the pivot relies on metaphorical association (tablet as code, memory as seed) rather than causal pressure, and the "soft reset" ending dissolves the physical constraints a bit too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a linear "demonstration" structure where a method is applied and succeeds without complication or cost. The closure—a successful emotional connection—lacks a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" involving a trade-off or price; it reads as symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an atmospheric opening to a decisive change in stance. The causal link between the weather data and the subway shafts relies on a conveniently timed backstory injection ("Years ago... he had studied"), which feels slightly like a skill download to resolve the plot, but the closure itself—a lateral move into the problem—is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from the setup of the experiment to the revelation and emotional release. The coincidence of the flower blooming exactly as the message is revealed is convenient but functionally paces the climax well.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist reframes the choice, anchored well by the rope metaphor. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient; the "riddle" dissolves through intellectual assertion rather than a pressurized struggle or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story executes a clean "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure, using the water drop to circularize the opening image effectively. While the causal chain is somewhat soft—driven by a sudden feeling of "heaviness" rather than an external catalyst—the structure holds together well under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean causal line from preparation to extraction, with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts a permanent internal cost. The ending feels slightly summarized ("He began the real work... The transformation was complete") rather than fully dramatized in the final beat, which keeps this just below the highest band. The orientation and drive lens are otherwise flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    A significant causality break undermines the climax: narration claims a "profound click of understanding" occurs in the present moment, yet the prop (a finalized grant agreement) reveals the decision was made and executed weeks prior. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction (a gift received with joy) without visible cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The arc resolves with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen trades artistic ego for communal service, offering genuine cost. While the spatial link between the fissure and the arbor is slightly disorienting, the thematic causality of his nature-skill solving the puzzle holds firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal path, but the resolution relies heavily on a convenient magical tool ("pendant as tuning fork") rather than hard-won causality. The climax resolves via abstract "doping" of the water with an idea, which feels mechanically soft and lowers the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a frictionless success path where the ritual works perfectly on the first try ("The fit was perfect"), lacking narrative drag or unexpected complication. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the absence of resistance makes the resolution feel earned by procedure rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot relies on the coincidence of finding the exact tape needed and uses the "sense memory" aptitude as a shortcut to bypass investigation. The resolution is a "Santa Claus" gift moment that lacks a legible cost or trade-off for the protagonist, resulting in a low-tension linear sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is causally tight, moving efficiently from the inciting struggle to a decisive physical change in tactics. The closure (switching tools) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that grounds the internal realization in action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the squall to the exchange and the resulting internal shift (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the climax relies heavily on the coincidence of the woman appearing at the exact moment of discovery, which weakens the causal chain despite the strong thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, following a clear Causal/Hybrid lens where the cave's pressure forces a realization. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and earned, though the pivot relies heavily on a vision granted at the last second.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on a high-magnitude coincidence—the specific relative of the trumpet's owner walking past the archive—to resolve the central mystery and provide emotional closure. While the "Two-Shard" structure is legible, the resolution feels unearned by the protagonist's agency, as the critical information arrives by chance rather than investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clear and the ending offers a valid Conceptual Repricing of the mentor's fate. However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the protagonist overcomes the primary obstacle (finding the route) instantly via innate ability, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the summary of "two days" dissipates the scene's tension right when it should tighten. The resolution relies on a magical *deus ex machina* (the tile working) rather than a costly human choice; the connection between whale songs and stars is solved by a sudden epiphany rather than deduced through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal chain leading to a valid Decisive Change at the closure. The structure is linear and logical; however, the obstacle (the amulet's resistance) is overcome relatively easily, which slightly flattens the tension curve before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, effectively utilizing the "breach of process" concept. While the "Ghost" ink functions as a slightly convenient plot device, the structural closure—the graph paper confirming the trade—lands with excellent conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative procedural structure with legible closure (the capture of the signal). However, the narrative is linear and lacks a "micro turn" or obstacle that generates a visible on-page cost; the success feels inevitable rather than earned through a specific trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, utilizing the tide to manage the rise and fall of tension. Closure lands as a resonant Earned Stasis; the return to waiting is re-contextualized as a purposeful act of existence, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a satisfying Conceptual Repricing at the end—the shift from looking at the sky to the floor recontextualizes the entire quest. The pivot relies slightly on the convenience of the tone "suddenly" locking in, but the closure is earned and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on montage and summary ("Soon, new art bloomed," "weeks ahead") rather than a pressurized, continuous scene, which violates the short-story scope defaults. The climax is passive—watching an inspector from afar—rather than an active engagement, dissipating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is coherent and orientation is solid, utilizing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the narrative lacks a decisive turning point where the outcome is genuinely in doubt; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is efficient and the "beat the clock" pacing works well to generate momentum. Causality is clean, though the climax relies on a linear progression of task-completion rather than a complex narrative turn; the closure provides a clear situational resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is flawless for this length, moving efficiently from the inciting herald (falcon) to the climactic revelation. The closure functions as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist realizes his life's work was merely a prelude to this witnessing. The causality of the magic system is taught and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (arrive, tune, walk, succeed) with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the trajectory is inevitable from the first paragraph; there is no tightening of the screw, unexpected obstacle, or moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear Inciting Incident and a Decisive Change at closure where the protagonist trades life for the memory. The causality holds up well under the pressure of the ticking clock. The climax relies slightly on convenient discovery ("And there... I found it"), but the paid cost of the protagonist's life validates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear inciting incident and a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to his father's legacy. The conceptual repricing at the end is excellent. Score capped at 8.7 due to Q7's failure to meet the strict technical gate for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.7)
    The structure is linear and coherent, but the narrative arc lacks protagonist agency, relying on a "gift" ending where the ghost solves the central mystery. The closure is an "explain-everything" memory dump ("He knew her name was Lyra...") rather than a resolution born of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a massive summary bridge ("Weeks turned to months") to advance the plot, bypassing the dramatic development of the community's involvement. This structural shortcut flattens the causal tension, though the climax itself lands with clear action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on summary for the central excavation process, lowering tension and pacing. The sudden appearance of a "hired local mason" to solve the heavy lifting is a narrative convenience that bypasses the physical cost of the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural sequence—checking data, drawing chalk, mailing a letter—without a causal turn or complication to disrupt the plan. While orientation is clear, the closure is merely the completion of a task rather than a resolution of tension or a shift in value with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure unit (transmission sent) is decisive. However, the causal link between the physical embroidery and the digital transmission is hand-waved ("converted her embroidered chart into a compressed data file"), skipping the mechanical friction of how an "old embroiderer" inputs complex data at a dusty terminal in seconds.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving from setup to ritual to resolution without confusion. The ending provides clear closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) as Kael gains the clarity he sought. However, the progression is procedural, lacking a causal twist or complication to heighten the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central turning point relies on an unearned knowledge leap: translating abstract smudges into specific poetic sentences breaks plausible causality. The resolution feels mechanically smoothed rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Causality is "lock-and-key": the protagonist enters with the solution (the shard) in hand and uses it at the first sign of difficulty. The "knowledge network" adds a step but no complication, and the ending relies on a soft emotional reset rather than a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc forms a clean, coherent loop, teaching the surreal logic of the garden effectively before using it to resolve the scene. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the journey clearly alters his approach to the initial problem on the scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the resolution relies on a technobabble-heavy gadget introduced late in the scene ("parasitic chronophage fungus"). The "wilting sunflower" serves as a solid inciting omen, but the climax feels rushed and the victory too clean given the stated catastrophic risks.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative operates as a fable-like summary ("For generations," "One cycle") rather than a grounded scene, creating significant distance. The pivotal turn ("a change began") is a *Deus Ex Machina* internal shift without an external trigger or causal setup, making the resolution feel unearned despite the clear symbolic closure of moving the postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vignette structure effectively delivers an atmospheric moment and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands the emotional cost, but the linear progression lacks Causal surprise or significant turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a linear causal path where the magic system acts as a shortcut to conflict resolution, forcing understanding rather than earning it through dialogue or action. While the closure is decisive (reconciliation), the "cost" is largely symbolic (ink, blood) and the risk of ruin mentioned in the text never materializes as a concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    A significant causality gap undermines the central investigation; the leap from microscopic pollen traces in glue to specific spatial coordinates in an amphitheater relies on "video game logic" rather than narrative cause and effect. The climax hinges on a convenient cache of explanations that resolves the central mystery without requiring the protagonist to pay a price or take a risk.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from stasis (ritual) to disruption (storm) to a new equilibrium. The inciting incident (the leak) effectively forces the protagonist out of his isolation. Orientation is immediate and grounded. The closure (sending the pigeon) is a decisive change that feels causally linked to the shared trauma of the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight and satisfies the drive lens: decoding the wood leads to the logbook, which predicts the door and clarifies the cost. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "necessary distance" is accepted and enacted through the final image of analyzing the chair.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible internal change (Resonant Reconfiguration) regarding the protagonist's sense of home. However, the deadline ("until sunrise") dissolves without forcing a concrete exterior choice about the transport, lowering the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear linear path, but the climax hinges on a convenient intuitive leap rather than an earned causal turn. While the closure provides a Conceptual Repricing (the end was a destination), it lacks the required "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" demanded by the rubric for high-band entry; the victory feels too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens, but the chain of events relies heavily on "magic physics" (water channeling precisely to a machine leg, a specific vibration dislodging a coin) that strains credibility. While the structure is complete and the closure (the light beam) lands as intended, the progression feels contrived for the sake of the set-piece. The lack of complications or adaptation reduces the plot to a linear checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    Structure is coherent, but the climax relies on an instant internal pivot ("He stilled... felt it") that lacks a felt trade-off or obstacle. Closure arrives as a straightforward "level up" where success is absolute, missing the requisite cost or complication to generate true narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Silas accepts the loss of his work. However, causality is soft; the transition from tension to total acceptance relies on a "stone in the pond" epiphany that conveniently resolves the conflict without forcing a hard trade-off or behavioral change.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    The structure is static, relying on a "campfire story" flashback rather than present-tense pressure or choice. The explanatory block near the end ("He needed to enlighten them...") halts momentum and explains the subtext, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line (experiment setup → execution → result) with legible closure on the gauge. However, the resolution feels procedural and low-stakes; the "dip to zero" resolves almost immediately without forcing a change in tactics. The cost—spent shells—is purely material, lacking the felt or conceptual weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where Elara renames the trauma—lands well, but the narrative path relies heavily on "miraculously preserved" plot coupons. The sequence of finding a legible diary and a pristine negative in a fireplace strains causality and convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a procedural vignette rather than a story with causal turns; events unfold linearly without complication. While legible, the ending is a soft reset where the protagonist leaves exactly as he arrived, offering no decisive change or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and adheres to a situational drive lens, moving from skepticism to a decisive closure (signing). However, the turning point relies on a symbolic gesture that dissolves generational hatred too easily, weakening the causal chain between the action and the result.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    The structure is a clean linear shard with a clear objective. The closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the loss of the egg reweights the silence of the landscape. However, the scientific causality—that dissolving proteins in a sulfur vent "seeds" a lineage or library of song—strains suspension of disbelief, forcing the reader to accept it as purely symbolic despite the biochemical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual process that lacks causal friction or unexpected complications; the rite succeeds exactly as planned. While the closure provides a conceptual release, the lack of an on-page pivot or obstacle makes the resolution feel inevitable and the "cost" (a sigh) negligible relative to the stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal arc is clean and tight: the aftermath of the argument triggers a specific memory, which forces a re-evaluation and a decisive change in tactic. The closure is excellent, offering a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of his artistic method rather than a simple retraction. The pacing effectively bridges the backstory (argument) with the present decision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, following a clear ritualistic structure from preparation to execution and departure. The closure (Earned Stasis) is legible and thematically fitting ("duty done"), though the linear progression offers few surprises or structural reconfigurations to heighten the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (task setup → work → success) without meaningful obstacles or cost. While the closure provides a clear conceptual reconfiguration (sound to light to silver), the lack of friction makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly causal: the storm forces urgency, the specific limitations of the protagonist force the method (dreams), and the dream provides the key. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "gray smear" of the present is resolved into clarity, paying off the setup with a distinct shift in state.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, effectively utilizing the interregnum setup to justify the ritual climax and the Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the progression lacks causal complications or setbacks, and the "cost" (spending a lifetime of thrift) is metaphorical rather than visceral, making the success feel inevitable and low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a literal Deus Ex Machina at the climax: a "point of coherent light" that simply materializes because it is needed. This undermines the Causal drive lens, as the protagonist does not generate the solution through ingenuity or sacrifice but merely utilizes a convenient manifestation. The closure is achieved through this external rescue rather than the character's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    The structure is flawless for this length, utilizing a distinct ritual to drive the narrative arc. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical loss of the frost-image recontextualizes her grief into capability.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from failure with traditional tools to a successful, improvised solution. The closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing: the fracture is redefined from a wound to a space for growth, validated by the immediate response of the crystal. The cost—relinquishing a sentimental token and professional dogma—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and effective, moving from the overwhelming orchard to the grounding bathroom and back. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the protagonist recontextualizes his existence with a legible conceptual cost (accepting his role as a mere gap in history). The transition logic holds up well under a Situational/Conceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on compression ("Elara spent weeks"), flattening the investigation into a synopsis rather than a scene with palpable tension. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, but the middle lacks immediate causal pressure due to the summary mode. Closure lands with a clear change, though the ease of the Curators' acceptance lowers the earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative structure (swatch sequence) leading to a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The "Garden" twist reframes the goal effectively with conceptual cost. The causality of the magic system is well-established and tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clear and the closure—integrating the anomaly rather than banishing it—lands with satisfying conceptual weight. However, the narrative arc is strictly linear; the protagonist faces no setbacks or complications between the inciting incident and the resolution, making the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch-and-fix" structure where the solution (the ice pattern) works perfectly on the first try. The closure provides relief but lacks a legible on-page cost or complication; the "dust of rock" is insufficient to register as the price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and successfully closes the loop on the beacon's repair, satisfying the Causal lens. However, the resolution feels mechanically perfect—the star map perfectly matches the debris, the shard fits perfectly, and the machine works immediately—lacking a "felt cost" or complication that characterizes elite fiction. The ending creates "symmetric satisfaction," resolving the tension without extracting a significant price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the discordant hum to the investigation and final realization. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing of the fog's purpose. However, the "conjecture" that links the fog to mnemonic scar tissue is a rapid intuitive leap, and the "specific glyph" on the forecourt appears only at the moment it is needed, lacking earlier spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative structure is clean, moving from failure to epiphany to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the definition of the cure changes. The causal link between finding the knot and decoding the wall relies on fable-logic, which works for the genre but feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight and effective, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the meaning of the departure is repriced as a natural transition. The arc from tension (silence) to observation to realization is cleanly executed, with the final beat offering legible closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the gravity inversion as a compelling frame for a clear departure-and-return loop. Closure is excellent; the final beat lands a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration where the room remains unchanged, but Elian’s internal capacity to endure it has expanded.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is linear and predictable, moving from anxiety to comfort without a complicating middle beat or reversal. While the orientation and closure are legible, the resolution ("she was finally looking up") feels unearned because there is no visible price paid for the transformation. It reads as a vignette rather than a story with narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path where obstacles yield immediately to Elara's competence, lacking a "felt cost" at closure. While the logic is sound and the ending definitive (purge canceled), the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and purposeful, with the "fading threshold" providing a clear inciting trigger for the ritual. The closure—a re-established, fragile link—offers a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration of their relationship status with legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is conceptually resonant, stabilizing the chaos into diamonds. However, the "glitchy slate" functions as a deus ex machina, explicitly instructing Elara on exactly where and how to apply the bolt, which significantly undercuts her agency in the problem-solving phase.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of her identity) is structurally sound. However, the climax hinges on a "magic box" mechanism (the standing waves delivering a data dump of truth) which bypasses narrative causality and cost. The protagonist simply turns a handle and receives the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the marionette program serving as a brilliant, tangible pivot for the plot. Closure is decisive and earned via the ritual, though the gauntlet clasp mechanism appears somewhat conveniently late in the sequence as a necessary trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong structural execution; the "accumulated dust pattern" serves as an excellent causal trigger that bridges setting and plot. Orientation is immediate, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Excellent orientation and a clean causal chain drive the narrative efficiently from the inciting silence to the broadcast. The closure is a decisive, resonant act that alters the status quo, creating a legible "Charged Poise" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causality is solid and the drive lens (Situational) holds; the music interacting with the prism creates a legible physical resolution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, though the linear progression lacks a significant reversal or unexpected complication to heighten the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: discovery, assembly, activation, resolution. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where a simple action (prodding) resolves the world's sorrow without sacrifice or complication. Causality is driven by convenient folklore rather than organic pressure, leading to a symmetrical, cost-free conclusion that fails the closure standard.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the Conceptual Repricing at the closure lands with a coherent image that recontextualizes the journey. However, the causal chain relies heavily on "magpie" convenience to initiate the plot, and the linear progression of success—finding cogs, finding the box, opening the door—lacks the setbacks or complications that create narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from an inciting absence to a resonant closure via a decisive ritual. The resolution (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with visible cost, effectively translating the internal grief into the physical transformation of the coin.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution arrives with minimal resistance, bypassing the need for a meaningful decision or cost. The "difficulty" of the quarry is stated but not dramatized, resulting in a closure that feels tidy rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative arc where sensory details and memory fragments build to a Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure is legible—Kaelen recontextualizes his situation from punishment to experiment—and the drive lens holds. However, the pivotal realization relies on a hallucinated voice ("Mercy is a rounding error") rather than a discovery made solely through the protagonist's active agency, which softens the causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure with clear orientation and causality. However, the resolution relies on a "magic key" mechanic where success is achieved on the first attempt through sheer will, lacking complications or unexpected turns. The closure creates a decisive change but feels symmetrically satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path, but the resolution hinges on a "psychometric dump" (touching the barrel creates a vision) which acts as a shortcut through the mystery. While the orientation and closure are legible, the story lacks a causal weave where Leo’s actions force the ghost’s revelation; instead, the answer is simply given to him.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is sturdy and linear (vial opens &gt; frost forms &gt; reality ruptures), leading to a clear Decisive Change at closure where the world is reset. However, the narrative lacks a meaningful "tightening" or reversal; the plan proceeds to success without complication or unexpected obstacles, making the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is linear and coherent, but the climax relies on the shard magically revealing the exact truth Kaelen desires without requiring a significant sacrifice or clever manipulation. The resolution feels gifted by the "temporal squall" phenomenon rather than forged by the protagonist's agency, and the "cost" of the revelation is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a linear drive, but the ending acts as a "magic button" that fixes the entire world without commensurate effort or sacrifice. The resolution feels unearned because the mechanism of victory—simply feeling humble—removes the weight of the apocalyptic stakes. The closure is decisive but lacks the friction of a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's worldview is altered. The use of psychometry to solve the maze feels slightly convenient (an ability introduced solely to bypass a wall), but it effectively bridges the physical and thematic journey.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot relies on significant convenience (the slide providing a precise instruction manual for the immediate threat) and "physics amnesia." A few pieces of driftwood stopping a "colossal wave" that shakes rock foundations breaks suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a mid-story summary ("Weeks passed") that deflates tension, skipping the struggle of the search. While the discovery sequence is logical, the closure is a "Conceptual Repricing" with no felt cost; the puzzle solves itself through patience rather than a pressure-driven decision that forecloses other options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally rigorous; the shift in the parley method directly triggers the antagonist's response and yields the coordinates. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (reframing the conflict as legacy) that unlocks a tangible reward, satisfying the 9+ requirement for cost and reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure functions well, building from silence to the first lights of creation without forcing artificial twists. The closure—a commitment to a lifetime of labor—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. The narrative arc is linear and lacks a distinct complication, but the pacing supports the vignette style effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a causal/revelatory lens, with the memory-immersion technique serving as a brilliant mechanical bridge between rising action and climax. The closure is a robust Conceptual Repricing: the mission flips 180 degrees with immediate, high-stakes logic. Orientation is established instantly, and the pacing is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative traces a linear path from problem to solution without a deepening complication or reversal. The resolution restores stability without exacting a visible or felt cost, resulting in a "symmetric satisfaction" ending that feels too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is complete and causally linked, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the resolution is too neat; the immediate, perfect success of the experiment without complication or felt cost lowers the narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, effective structure for a lyric vignette, transitioning from a habitual ritual to a singular, transformative moment. The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the inciting incident ("One cycle") lacks specific causal grounding, feeling somewhat arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist simply obeys the ghost's pointing without significant obstacle or complication. The resolution relies on a magical object that instantly fixes the emotional burden, feeling like a convenient deus ex machina rather than an earned causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a convenient intuitive leap. The connection between the traveler's message ("willow") and the sudden realization that the silo is a resonator (and that he must press the shard against a specific panel he’d previously ignored) is tenuous causality. The traveler functions as a plot device to deliver the key without generating scene-level friction.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story functions as a mood vignette with a legible accumulative arc, but the closure is tidy and low-impact. The resolution—mentally composing a poem—feels like "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by simply deciding to view it differently, lacking narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the orchard. However, the middle relies on summary montage ("Days bled into weeks") rather than dramatized scenes, reducing the structural tension of the "how."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal/Internal arc where the protagonist’s skepticism is dismantled by the logic of the setting. Closure is a precise Conceptual Repricing: the realization that "artificial" does not mean "fake" recontextualizes the pilgrimage, and the physical placement of the amber seals this shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative structure holds together with a clear procedural arc that leads to a valid form of Earned Stasis closure ("He would be back tomorrow"). The narrative is coherent, though it relies on linear sequencing without significant causal turns or complications to drive the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, building from a static investigation to a journey and discovery. While the causal link between reading decoded text and the dog smelling a direction is slightly tenuous, the closure unit—a resonant reconfiguration of the quest’s goal—lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc relies on a convenient "glimpse" that resolves the central tension passively. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, it feels unearned because the protagonist sketches and the universe simply provides the answer without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative arc lacks a genuine test; the heist succeeds via a simple distraction and the resolution—Sylas accepting the chaotic seed—feels unearned and devoid of sacrifice. The "easy fix" ending undermines the declared cosmic stakes and lacks the required closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear causal chain driven by the gallery's acoustics. While the Regent’s pivot from ruthlessness to mercy upon seeing tears is a slightly idealistic resolution, it is grounded in the "benevolent" aspect of her characterization, satisfying the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story relies on extensive summary ("For weeks, she navigated...") rather than a dramatized scene, distancing the reader from the struggle. The pivotal breakthrough—a memory conveniently surfacing just when needed—lacks causal force or earned cost, and the explicit moralizing at the end flattens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is strong (Resonant Reconfiguration) with a clear effect on the page. However, the mechanism relies on a convenient symbolic projection—mapping specific chess moves to a tapestry's random threads—that blurs the causal logic of the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from the inciting horn to a distinct climatic action. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "shattered" echo changes the world state, and the cost (arrest) is acknowledged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure via a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is undercut by the ending where the "spell gave back what it had taken." By returning the breath and blasting the monsters away with golden light, the narrative waives the physical stakes established early on, resulting in a "soft reset" victory that lacks the requisite felt or visible cost for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is complete, with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the shell is released. However, the "wrong turn" functions as a convenient plot device that solves the navigation problem immediately without agency, reducing the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path where a magical solution resolves the central problem instantly without complication or visible cost. The primary antagonist (Hemlock) is asleep, removing active opposition, and the 'victory' relies on a convenient ability that works perfectly on the first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative suffers from a significant consistency error: the moon is described as "full and pregnant" in the second paragraph, then as a "crescent moon" ("broken horn") during the climax. Additionally, the cryptic clues are solved instantly in narration, removing narrative tension and friction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc where the protagonist acquires a tool, endures a high-stakes ritual, and faces an immediate test of its success. The closure is excellent; the neighbor's arrival validates the transformation (the ability to withhold the full truth) without over-explaining the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.5)
    The transition "Weeks bled into a month" breaks the short-story scope, dissolving tension into summary rather than sustaining a dramatized scene. The resolution relies on a magical ability (psychometry) to provide answers, bypassing causal investigation. This structure avoids the necessary pressure of a "demanding" narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, with the "ant mapping" providing a unique, causal entry point into the magical element. The closure functions as a "Conceptual Repricing" where the protagonist reframes his reality, though the mechanism of the resolution (a vision provided by the door) relies more on receiving information than active struggle in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong structural arc with a clear Causal drive; the ascent provides good pacing. Closure is effective as a Conceptual Repricing of her role, transitioning from prisoner to guardian with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a distinct inciting incident (Kael's confession) and a decisive change in methodology at the climax. The resolution provides solid closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the flawed sun becomes functional through grief. However, the pivot relies on a soft magic realization that feels slightly convenient—the solution appears instantly once the mindset shifts, lacking a concrete cost or struggle in the execution phase.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from frustration to release, but the "waking trance" function acts as a soft reset, resolving the emotional tension through a visionary experience rather than confrontation with the immediate reality. The causality holds under a situational lens, but the bridge between the cabin reality and the flight sequence feels structurally convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from the inciting request to the resonant closure. The causality is sound, though the resolution comes with relatively low friction; Elara succeeds on her first attempt without a moment of doubt or near-failure, which flattens the dramatic tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    The "held breath" timer creates effective structural pressure, but the ending functions as a soft reset. The affliction vanishes completely ("unblemished skin") with no lasting scar or cost, making the resolution feel unearned and too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). The cost is established early (exorbitant fee + invasion of sister's privacy) and paid to achieve the result. The inciting incident and climax are well-paced within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear procession toward a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where death is reframed as resolution. The "wanderingly exact" spiral provides a coherent structure, and the dropped dictionary creates a legible final beat. However, the lack of narrative friction or obstacles turns the plot into a ritualistic ceremony rather than a story of causal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight and effective, following a clear Situational/Accumulative drive. The causality from the whistle’s pressure to the ice shard’s appearance is internally consistent and satisfying. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist redefines the "error" as a message, carrying a clear conceptual cost (abandoning mechanical perfection).

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Decisive Change, but the resolution faces minimal resistance, creating a "soft reset" effect where the problem is solved perfectly on the first try. The orientation is solid, but the lack of complications flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a "montage" summary ("For weeks") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, which dissipates tension in a short story. The puzzle logic feels convenient—the leap from a spiral on mica to a specific subway seat via "cross-referencing" lacks on-page struggle or trial-and-error.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative establishes a clear premise and loop, but the climax relies on summary ("For an hour, they spoke in this circle") rather than dramatized action. This glosses over the pivotal shift in the caller's psyche, weakening the causal payoff of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a massive coincidence (Tomas appearing at the "exact time") and a Deus Ex Machina (magical flowers) to resolve the central conflict. The leap from restoring a photo to healing a "generation-spanning feud" lacks a credible causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Causal trajectory is executed with precision; the pivot from the magical rumor to the mundane repair creates a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with the visible cost of Silas abandoning his "ghost" persona to join the group.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.3)
    The story relies heavily on a montage summary ("For days that bled into one another") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, violating the single-scene or tight two-shard scope preferred for this length. While the Accumulative lens is clear, the middle section lacks immediate pressure, reading more like a synopsis of a journey than a lived event. The closure is a standard conceptual reversal (harmony vs. silence) that lands softly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative structure is sound, moving from inciting incident to a clear closure via Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the middle section relies on a summarized montage of "butterfly effect" failures (solar flares, political schisms) rather than dramatized causality, which weakens the visceral impact of the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent, moving clearly from minor silences to the major "active" silence at the ferry landing. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the atmosphere physically shifts from silence to music, though the progression feels linear and inevitable rather than fraught with risk.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the climax relies heavily on a fortuitous coincidence: the specific timing of the afternoon sun aligning perfectly with the window fissure at the exact moment he applies the tapestry. While the closure (the decision to paint) is strong, the mechanical resolution of the mystery strains credibility for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, leveraging the "side effect" setup to justify the climax in the sound wave garden. While the protagonist’s escape encounters little external resistance, the structural build to the "auric lagoon" is solid, and the closure lands with a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration of her grief.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is clear and the inciting challenge drives the plot, but the resolution relies on a convenient, pre-owned solution (the special key) that removes struggle. The closure is a tidy victory lap that lacks the required "felt cost" to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is logically earned through the specific application of the tool and setting. While the causal chain is clear, the resolution feels somewhat mechanical ("fix-it" ending) because the problem yields immediately to the protagonist's competence without complication or price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—a shift in collective consciousness anchored by Maya—lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the excursion to the grotto feels like a "fetch quest" detour that pauses the rising action rather than escalating it. The causality of the window display is strong, but the grotto sequence is structurally loose.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina (the bone's heart-unlocking ability) to bypass the central interpersonal conflict. The premise of a world without violence is introduced in the first paragraph but abandoned, failing to impact the plot or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scene follows a clear, effective arc from theatrical performance to authentic, silent creation, creating a strong structural pivot. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the wooden bird transforms the dead bouquet—lands with earned emotional weight and legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a straight line of arrival, observation, and realization without causal tightening or obstacles. The closure (a conceptual realization) feels like a gift from the setting rather than a result of the protagonist's agency or sacrifice. The drive lens is weak because there is no moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on convenient expertise (Elian's sudden ability to read plants) and possession (having the reed ready) to bypass struggle. The "days" of work are summarized rather than dramatized, removing the friction necessary for a satisfying causal arc. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear puzzle-solution sequence lacking a decisive change or felt cost; the miner's lens functions as a magic key that instantly resolves the conflict without sacrifice. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," where the problem is solved perfectly upon the first new attempt, bypassing the need for a meaningful trade-off. The climax relies on technobabble ("transmuted it") rather than causal character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a frictionless linear progression; the montage ("Over the next week") glosses over relationship dynamics that could have provided necessary texture. Closure lands effectively with the stencil's repurposing, but the lack of setbacks makes the resolution feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "sage and seeker" structure is stable and delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing for Julian. However, the POV character remains largely static, observing rather than struggling against causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with a legible Decisive Change at closure where Elara becomes the vessel. The logic of the ritual (chaos vs. pattern) holds the drive lens effectively through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean with a distinct "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the memory is restored but irrevocably altered. The causal chain is strong, linking the video diagnosis directly to the resolution, though the "stone-as-conduit" mechanism is slightly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, using the repair of the tail as an effective objective correlative for the protagonist's internal healing. The closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "molting" parallel feels somewhat predetermined rather than forged under immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly focused, moving from the physical sensation of the scar to a psychic excavation and finally to a conceptual reconfiguration. Closure is definitive: a Conceptual Repricing of his trauma that lands with undeniable emotional cost. The causality of the “method” is surreal but strictly adherent to the story’s established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "look and see" structure with no complications or causal turns; the inciting incident leads directly to the resolution without obstruction. Closure is a weak realization that lacks the required visible or felt cost; the protagonist leaves the scene exactly as she entered, merely possessing new information.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story utilizes a "soft reset" closure; the conflict is resolved by redefining the noise as music, which removes the problem without a trade-off. The climax relies on the coincidence of a "meteor of impossible brightness" rather than the protagonist's agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting tremor to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the threat is synthesized into art. The causal link between Kaelen's specific method and the outcome is strong. The resolution is slightly smooth—the obstacle yields to expertise relatively easily—but the final image of the crystalline pine anchors the change well.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and coherent, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing where the gear and the character's purpose are redefined. Orientation is handled efficiently, though the plot is strictly linear—he walks, finds a tree, and understands—without Causal complications or reversals to test the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and legible, successfully completing a rite-of-passage structure. However, the progression feels pre-ordained; the guides arrive and assist without friction, and the "leash breaking" (the true inciting incident) happens off-page, leaving the on-page scene with low causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is exemplary, utilizing the bolt as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that fundamentally alters the relationship dynamic without a word spoken. The flashback is tightly anchored to the specific "discoloration" on the stair, ensuring the past serves present pressure rather than stalling momentum. The cause-and-effect chain from the memory to the decision to "remain" and finally to the confrontation is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, processional structure where the protagonist completes a ritual without obstruction or reversal. While the closure (the unmaking and his dissolution) is distinct and logically follows the premise, the lack of on-page resistance makes the sequence feel like a victory lap rather than a story. The causal logic of the magic system is coherent and well-seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, and the Resonant Reconfiguration at the end provides legible closure. However, the turning point relies on a low-agency realization (looking down at the map again) that lacks causal pressure. The "rare confluence" sets a clock, but the transition from failure to success feels unearned by the character's prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path (align, hum, succeed) without setbacks or meaningful obstacles. While the closure (satellite response) is clear, it arrives without a visible or felt price paid by the protagonist; the solution works perfectly on the first try, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure—recipe execution—rather than a dramatic arc with reversal or cost. While the sequence is clear and the ending offers a Decisive Change (the embryo unsealed), the success feels inevitable and lacks a "visible, felt, or conceptual cost" to anchor the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a tight, coherent arc from inciting trigger to resolution via a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (Earned Stasis). The pacing is effective, allowing the internal crisis to peak and resolve within the scene's constraints without feeling rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear arc with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure (remapping vs. repairing). The inciting object triggers the turn effectively. However, the resolution of the "walls closing in" pressure feels somewhat rapid, resolving the tension with a neatness that slightly undercuts the established chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative traces a clear arc from the eclipse's end to Kael's departure, effectively functioning as a prologue or inciting incident with a legibly costly choice. The causal link between the drone and the "time slowing" mystery is weak, relying on an asserted hunch ("He believed...") rather than evidential logic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal arc is clear, moving from discovery to a Decisive Change that releases the truth. However, the convenience of the "dormant networks" lowers the difficulty, and the "purity purge" stakes are told rather than shown in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean Situational drive lens, where the discovery of the knife forces a crystallization of Elara's stance. The closure is excellent—a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts the object's presence but denies its use, effectively "boxing" the violence. Orientation is immediate and stable. The causality holds firmly, with the physical environment grounding the internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal path (enter, navigate, strike, exit), and the objective is achieved. However, the closure relies on a near-magical resolution ("ceased to be a man") rather than a tactical pivot with a tangible price; the "weight of memory" is too abstract to register as a felt cost. The orientation is solid, but the climax feels like a predetermined success rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and circular, moving from the disruption of the call to the resolution of the "orbit." The causality of the "proof by contradiction" is logical, though it relies on the journalist having missed fairly accessible public records (the mining relief fund), which slightly strains plausibility. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the father’s regret is recontextualized as protection—lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence (finding his own letters in a purchased desk) to launch the plot, breaking causal credibility. The climax employs symbolic logic—scratching a casing to recode firmware—that lacks grounding in the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, moving from the discovery of the tile to the creation of the mandala and the resulting communal shift. The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the sacrifice of the tile (the "cost") anchoring the shared focus. However, the progression is linear and lacks significant obstacles; the environment and secondary characters yield immediately to the protagonist's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal arc: diagnosis, intervention, and result. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) is strong, trading a man's traumatic history for a hollow peace. The pacing is steady, though the reliance on expository summary ("The core concept of his work was simple") to bridge the middle slightly weakens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative drive, where Julian layers sensory echoes to reweight Elara’s state. The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her purpose, though the "cost" of Julian’s energy expenditure is stated rather than deeply felt as a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tightly structured around the two painting attempts, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "signal" is accepted regardless of its scientific validity. The visual payoff of the two contrasting light paintings creates a decisive, earned closure. Causality is impeccable under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. While the causal chain is solid (sensor fails -> use fossil -> merge), the progression lacks significant obstacles or reversals that would heighten the sense of risk before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a well-earned Decisive Change at the ending. The "magic logic" of buttons decoding whispers holds consistently within the fable frame, and closure lands with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear causal chain and a functional inciting incident (the meeting). The "snow code" mechanism serves as a distinct, tension-building constraint that forces attention and creates a natural deadline (melting/scuffing), leading to a solid Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative structure is solid, effectively using the waiting period to frame a Conceptual Repricing closure where the vow is recontextualized. The pacing anchors (rain, hammering) provide a clear sense of time.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands clearly, but the causality relies on soft "dream logic" where kindness magically repairs reality without significant cost or friction. The "dissolving world" transition feels slightly abrupt, though the structural integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure works well for this fable-like piece, utilizing a ritualistic montage to build toward a resonant closing image. The closure (the widening blind) is a legible Resonant Reconfiguration that validates the effort, though the "one week later" jump compresses the cost of the wait slightly too much.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a legible linear path, but the causality relies on the magical mechanism of the stones and sundial rather than the protagonist's ingenuity. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" epiphany that resolves the conflict without a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from isolation to reconnection with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). The pivot relies on a coincidental external catalyst (the sun breaking through) to trigger the realization, which slightly diminishes the protagonist's agency in the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive from the identification of the signal to the deployment of the counter-measure. However, the resolution is frictionless; the "press button to solve riot" mechanic works too instantly and conveniently, lacking the causal complication or "cost" usually required for a higher-stakes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.3)
    The climax relies on unearned intuition ("desperate clarity") and opaque magic mechanics, resolving the threat with a convenient "soft reset." The causality of the compass point stabilizing reality is not established, reading as a *deus ex machina* rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is tight and effective, moving from a clear inciting desire to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the scratch) that satisfies the drive lens. The narrative arc mirrors the painting process perfectly. The closure is strong, delivering a conceptual repricing of the "portrait" that aligns with the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot lacks causal friction or setbacks; clues are deciphered instantly ("cross-referenced... found them") and physical barriers are overcome with ease ("found the 'weeping rock' easily"). The resolution is unearned, as the protagonist faces no active opposition from the antagonistic forces established in the backstory, making the closure feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational/Accumulative lens, moving efficiently from the aftermath of the miracle to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The causality—using the glass flake's evidence to decode the bridge mesh—is tight and supports the magical realist logic without breaking suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "rise and fall" timeframe forces a summary-heavy structure that distances the reader from the central conflict and prevents a tightly paced scene. The resolution relies partly on a "market downturn" (deus ex machina) rather than solely on the protagonist's agency, weakening the causal link between the confrontation and the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure (the puzzle recontextualized as a lament). However, the causal link between the star chart and the temple glyphs relies heavily on dream logic and authorial fiat rather than earned discovery. The pacing is steady, but the "solution" feels somewhat unearned due to the convenience of the grandfather's clue.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, with a clear causal drive from the ritual to the resolution. The physicalization of the metaphor (unbending the branch to release the truth) creates a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, where the cost and change are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual preparation to a climax of synthesis. The pivot—heeding the warning to create a vector rather than find a destination—provides a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration. The causality is slightly soft, relying on the symbolic logic of the topiary clipping to solve a metaphysical problem.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, with a strong drive lens that holds from the inciting shadow attack to the resolution. Closure is excellent; the sacrifice of a specific, "sun-drenched" memory is a visible, felt cost that earns the victory. The transition from backstory to present action is smooth, and the ending reconfigures the stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, utilizing a classic object-trigger structure to achieve a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing closure. The flashback is well-anchored by the physical struggle with the cloth, ensuring the backstory propels rather than halts the present action. The final decision to display the cloth effectively creates a legible "after" state with emotional cost (the loss of his protective "fortress").

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear path with minimal resistance; the central experiment succeeds immediately without complication or cost. The resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the universe perfectly confirms the protagonist’s hypothesis, resulting in a somewhat tidy, wish-fulfillment ending.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear ritual structure, moving smoothly from the inciting tidal shift to the resonant reconfiguration of the ore. The pacing aligns well with the atmospheric intent. The closure is solid, though the lack of a complicating variable or unexpected obstacle makes the sequence feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the mechanism (pearl + crystal = broadcast) relies on convenient "dream logic" established only moments before use. The causality is soft; the reversal of the system is a magical fix rather than a solution rooted in the bunker's established engineering.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on a coincidence—finding a perfectly relevant philosophical quote in a derelict bathroom—to resolve the central conflict. While the closure (leaving the accordion) lands with a legible cost (Resonant Reconfiguration), the causal path to get there is undercut by this *deus ex machina* device.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative functions as a linear puzzle-solve; the propagation delay mechanic provides a clear Causal path, but the "lie" and "second letter" remain vague plot devices. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration ("Stay"), but the cost is low.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured, moving from complicity to a Decisive Change with clear causality. The dual use of plant psychometry (revealing the past) and coffee divination (revealing the future) creates a satisfying temporal symmetry that drives the resolution without feeling disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path ("happy path") with no causal turns or reversals. The ending returns to stasis without a Decisive Change or felt cost; the threshold is crossed and the memory captured with routine ease.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent but linear, lacking significant complications or reversals; the problem is solved immediately upon identification. While the use of the heirloom creates a mild conceptual cost (degrading a pristine object into a tool), the lack of resistance makes the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal arc is clean, moving efficiently from the diagnostic opening to the decisive closure. The ending acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the discarding of the cloak physically manifests the internal change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scene follows a tight, functional arc with a clear turning point in the ring reversal. The closure works as a Conceptual Repricing, where Kael accepts the counter-intuitive cost of "letting go" to achieve his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    Structure is clear, but causality relies on coincidence (the wind revealing the arrow) rather than protagonist agency. The resolution ("flick of pure will") feels unearned, lacking a visible cost or complication to make the victory substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the turning point relies on a spontaneous internal realization ("Then, a thought... pierced his frustration") rather than a causal trigger derived from the action. The closure is legible, but the path to it feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear trajectory from the pier to the wreck, maintaining a strong causal thread. The closure functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift from "empty" to "not empty" earns the ending without resolving the grief too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong, linking the coin mechanism directly to the specific auditory payoff. The prophecy effectively drives the Conceptual Repricing at closure, though its introduction via memory at the end feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens: the discovery of the atlas provokes a specific desire (naming the fear), leading to the crystallization ritual and a concrete resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the grief is not removed, but reified into a manageable object ("a scar given form"), providing a satisfying earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from established futility to a resonant breakthrough, and the closure (moisture appearing) offers a legible Decisive Change. The "click of understanding" climax relies on a sudden internal epiphany rather than a pressure-forced adaptation, slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a montage structure ("spent his evenings in the county archive") that violates the short-form default of continuous scenes, diluting narrative tension. The pivotal discovery—finding the key photo in his own attic after searching archives—reads as convenient plotting (Deus Ex Machina) that undermines the investigation's causality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line, but the link between the starlings and the tree relies on a vague "impulse he did not question," weakening the investigative chain. The resolution hinges on a convenient object (the locket) that unlocks the problem instantly, reducing narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and the Decisive Change at closure (averting the threat) is legible and valid. However, the pacing drags slightly when Kael stops to "sketch a schematic" during a time-critical crisis, which feels like a forced insertion of character traits rather than urgent action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (responsibility replacing numbness) lands clearly. However, Jin's sudden passivity during the climax—stopping simply to watch—weakens the causal chain of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—planting the seed as a contract—lands effectively. However, the middle investigation phase is underdeveloped; the central "riddle" is resolved too conveniently via a database search and sudden intuition, rushing the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arc is clean and tight, moving from the weight of silence to a decisive, noise-driven release. Closure lands effectively with the wife’s smile (Resonant Reconfiguration), though the final sentence summarizes the "seed of healing" rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from stasis to disruption and back to a reconfigured stasis (Earned Stasis). The climax utilizes a clever causal link where Lyel uses the specific energy of his homesickness to counter the ritual, satisfying the "because/therefore" requirement of the causal lens. Closure is distinct and comes with the felt cost of the sealed door.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The causality of the central epiphany is functional, though it feels slightly convenient as an internal realization rather than an externally forced turn.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc from the noise crisis to the technical resolution. While the closure qualifies as a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the city’s meaning, the lack of a tangible felt cost—she succeeds without significant sacrifice or trade-off—softens the ending’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution where the protagonist fixes a cosmic rift by tuning a radio, a solution unearned by prior causality or established rules. The closure is a "magic wand" moment that restores the status quo without visible cost, sacrifice, or consequence, failing the closure requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is sturdy: the memory shift directly forces a change in the work, leading to a chemically pure but emotionally cold outcome. The closure is a strong example of Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist succeeds in his task but is trapped by the result, creating a clear "be careful what you wish for" irony.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Night after night") to bypass the struggle of discovery, reducing the climax to a low-stakes presentation. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end is legible, the linear path to success lacks the causal tightening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved without cost or complication. The closure acts as a soft reset for the secondary character, lacking the "felt cost" or "decisive change" required for higher bands; the resolution is tidy rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    The introduction of the phase-shifting capability serves as a deus ex machina to bypass the central physical obstacle (the collapse), breaking causal tension. The resolution is mechanically tidy but lacks earned narrative cost, as the solution is revealed exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative relies on a "gift" ending where the console explicitly displays the answer ("The architecture isn't in the stars"), resolving the conflict without protagonist agency or cost. The resolution is intellectual and unearned, missing a decisive change or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear discovery plot that resolves via a "magic fix" without complication or setbacks. While orientation is clear and the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the resolution lacks a felt or conceptual cost, as the "curse" is explicitly negated and success is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is sound, utilizing a single scene to drive a clear Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's grief. Closure is decisive and resonant, though the heavy exposition in the opening paragraph delays entry into the scene's immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is functional but relies on a summary bridge ("For weeks, she experimented") that diffuses the tension between the inciting incident and the climax. The resolution is linear and convenient; the vines defeat the Wardens instantly upon the musical cue, lacking a complex causal pivot or a "try-fail" cycle within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line to a legible closure, but the lack of a complication or mid-scene reversal makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned against active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving efficiently from discovery to preparation to release. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the silence from an absence to a "listening." The pacing works well, though the causal link at the climax relies heavily on the magical atmosphere rather than character pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece functions as a coherent vignette or "incident" rather than a fully realized story; it lacks a decisive change or irrevocable cost at closure. While the "proof of concept" ending provides a form of Conceptual Repricing, the stakes of the ritual feel experimental rather than critical, resulting in a soft landing that proves a point without altering the protagonist's status or world.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on the coincidence of a foggy morning to provide the resolution, violating the rule that luck should complicate rather than solve. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—he desires the dream, performs the ritual, and succeeds—without the on-page cost or structural twist required for literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path where the outcome is never in doubt, resulting in a low-tension arc. The closure provides a "happy ending" reset without the required felt or conceptual cost that would give the resolution narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal chain is solid, moving from routine to anomaly to breach of protocol with clear logic. The closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, offering a "key" rather than a total fix, though the specific mechanics of the constellation detection feel slightly underexplained for their importance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Elara’s decision to stay and "restack the scrolls" rather than take the map acts as a decisive refusal that redefines resilience on her own terms. The causality is tight, moving from the warning (shadow cube) to the test (map) to the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success with no obstacles, complications, or setbacks; the solution works instantly on the first attempt. The ending violates the closure requirement for cost, acting as a "magic wand" resolution that dissolves the central problem without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, following a linear Accumulative structure from setup to ritual execution to a resonant closure. The inciting pressure is established early, and the ending successfully transfers the burden to the apprentice (Charged Poise), effectively grounding the scope of the "long night" ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the Conceptual Repricing closure (tear as threshold) lands effectively. However, the investigation lacks friction; the jump from a map tear to locating two specific canisters of footage in county archives happens via convenient summary, bypassing potential obstacles that would generate narrative drive. The causality is functional but lacks the texture of genuine difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on a "note in a bottle" (the brass cylinder) to explain the sci-fi premise and backstory, triggering the "explain-everything ending" anti-pattern. This reduces the investigation to passive reading rather than active deduction, weakening the causal chain of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is coherent, governed effectively by the lightning timeframe, and the closure is unambiguous. However, the "false failure" beat—where thunder cuts the beam only for the image to glow anyway—is a standard trope that resolves immediately without exacting a visible cost or altering the outcome's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The elevator structure provides a tight, effective frame for the narrative arc, with floors marking distinct beats of discovery. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing (tragedy re-framed as protection), though the sunlight solution at the third floor relies slightly on serendipity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative drive lens functions well, building intensity through the sequence of cloud observations. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration of Elias's role, landing firmly on the page. While the appearance of the perfect fractal is a coincidence that borders on convenient, it fits the "world as library" premise established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly focused, moving from the inciting silence to the resonant closure without wasted motion. The causality of the lock mechanism—relying on the protagonist's unique perception—feels earned rather than convenient. Closure is achieved through a "Charged Poise" where the success of the creation paradoxically coexists with imminent destruction, landing with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central causal pivot—ancient floor markings predicting the live, specific movements of starlings tonight—strains credibility and feels like "movie logic" rather than earned narrative causality. Closure is achieved, but it is a gain-only victory (finding the light) without the required visible or felt cost to anchor the change.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal arc is clean and the closure is decisive, satisfying the prompt's requirements for a resolved narrative. The trajectory is linear—problem, key discovery, application, fix—which works well, though the reliance on specific prophecy instructions to solve the puzzle reduces narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    The plot follows a linear "fetch quest" structure where protagonists lack agency, merely executing the ghost's instructions. The climax—an "impossible climb"—is summarized rather than shown, dissipating tension before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves legible closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (the lullaby replacing the void). However, the progression is strictly linear and lacks causal turns; the outcome feels predetermined by the premise rather than earned through on-page maneuvering or unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is legible with clear orientation and a definitive closure event. However, a logical gap creates friction at the end: Elias consumes his "single" remaining nut to save the traveler, yet returns to his role as guardian without addressing the depletion of the critical resource needed to fulfill that duty.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is legible and orientation is solid, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (the decision to write the letter). The pacing is smooth, though the central turning point ("slow, widening dawn") relies on internal realization without external pressure or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear fable logic, and the ending functions as a Conceptual Repricing where the meaning of "clean slate" shifts. However, the progression lacks resistance; the solution (finding the tree and cutting it) proceeds without setbacks or missteps, making the closure feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is solid, with a clear Inciting Incident and a Decisive Change at closure that reconfigures the protagonist's state. The causal link between analyzing puddle sediment and finding a specific deep-desert location relies on a convenient leap ("sudden, staggering clarity") that strains the drive lens, though the fable-like logic sustains it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: problem presented, solution applied, problem solved. The "fight back" from the elevator network is resolved almost instantly by nudging a dial, lacking the necessary back-and-forth pressure or genuine risk of failure. Closure is symmetric and tidy, lacking a felt cost or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured with clear orientation and a decisive closure unit (successful modification). The drive lens is causal, though the climax—resolving the conflict by "focusing all her will"—feels somewhat frictionless compared to the established stakes of mental erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with solid orientation and a legible Decisive Change at closure. The stakes regarding the "intellectual plague" feel telescopic—declared as world-ending but abstract in the scene—which slightly distances the urgency. The gravity constraint effectively shapes the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural lacking causal friction or setbacks; the solution (the Old One's cracks) is identified and executed without struggle. While the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration of the silence, the absence of obstacles or paid cost makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative is linear and accumulative, leading to a legible closure, but lacks causal complications; the protagonist simply waits and observes until he is proven right. The epiphany feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, utilizing a clear ticking clock (the fireworks) to pressure the central action. The closure is effective—an Earned Stasis where he achieves access but refuses to violate privacy—though the mechanism of success ("a place that just *felt* right") relies slightly too much on convenient intuition rather than a hard-won causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean Situational arc, using the arrival of the "tide" to force a crystallization of stance. Closure is excellent: the return to the wrapping paper creates a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the goal from control to coexistence without needing the flower to bloom on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story follows a linear fetch-quest structure that moves efficiently but resolves too neatly; the climax relies on a simple skill check (piloting/drone use) without exacting a felt cost or forcing a sacrifice. The ease of the resolution—snipping the shard and escaping—undercuts the tension set up by the gravity constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    The climax relies on retroactive omniscience, where Kaelen deduces a highly specific chain of events—including a "neuro-inhibitor gas" and a "drone power core"—purely from wind patterns, which breaks causal plausibility. This "explain-everything" summary substitutes a magic-bullet solution for dramatized discovery, undercutting the investigation's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear description of a ritual without causal complication or opposition. While a change occurs (hush to wonder), it lacks the required "felt cost" for closure; the outcome is guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story follows a clean causal arc (ritual leading to insight) with a legible Conceptual Repricing closure where Kaelen redefines his past failure. The resolution relies heavily on the magical response providing the answer, which slightly dampens the sense of active protagonist agency in solving the puzzle. Orientation and pacing are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from a clear inciting incident to a decisive closure via Resonant Reconfiguration. The magic system follows an internal logic that pays off in the final beat. The causality holds up well under the "scientific magic" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The opening hook of "being followed" is an unkept promise that vanishes without complication or resolution, creating a false setup. The closure relies on a "Resonant Reconfiguration" triggered entirely by external magic/coincidence rather than protagonist agency, lacking a legible cost for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands with exceptional force through a Decisive Change that is both physical (the image) and conceptual (the realization). The causal logic of the experiment is tight, and the outcome creates an undeniable before/after state for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is legible and impactful, with the cost of the magic system clearly paid on the page. However, the backstory regarding the puzzle pieces is delivered via a convenient realization that blurs the timeline of when the project—and the understanding of the map—actually began.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving from a clear inciting context to a decisive action and a resonant closure. The causal logic of the "bartered awakening" holds firmly, and the ending delivers a Decisive Change with an unmistakable, irreversible price paid on the page. The pacing perfectly suits the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is efficient, pivoting cleanly from atmospheric setup to a high-stakes realization that the "echo" is an active threat. The logic of the recurring pulse justifies the timing of the climax, avoiding the trap of convenient coincidence. Closure is achieved through a distinct Decisive Change that alters the state of the world and the protagonist's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is complete and the causality is sound, moving from disruption to restoration. The score is limited by the summary of the physical journey ("The journey was a battle against wind and water") and the lack of mechanical friction during the climax; the repair is resolved too easily with a rag and a match.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear description of a procedure without a distinct inciting incident or meaningful complication to test the protagonist. The closure (a conceptual realization about the dawn shaping him) feels tacked on, lacking a causal foundation in the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies on summary ("Weeks turned into a season") which dissipates tension before the climax. The resolution hinges on a coincidence—that the subject knew the heart donor—which shortcuts the investigative causality established by the sun trails method. The closure lands as a realization, but the logic connecting the chalk experiment to the woman's identity is tenuous and mystical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative arc is a clean, linear procedural that orients the reader well and delivers the required closure. However, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, and the lack of a distinct "felt cost" or sacrifice at the ending limits the emotional impact and keeps the story in a safe lane.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative follows a linear gather-and-resolve structure that lacks causal friction or setbacks. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction"—solving both the external crisis (the tree) and the internal wound (her memory) perfectly—violating the requirement for closure with a felt cost. The result is tidy but devoid of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible inciting incident and resolution. The closure (smoothing the invitation) functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the internal logic moves a bit too effortlessly from fear to clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is efficient and flawless, utilizing a distinct inciting incident and a prop-driven turning point that feels inevitable yet surprising. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara is exposed but validated—with the cost of her secrecy clearly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible scene with a clear beginning, middle, and end under an accumulative lens. The closure—capturing the essence while losing the object—is a valid "Earned Stasis," but the linear progression lacks causal friction or unexpected turns; the success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a strong causal spine using a "rule of three" structure (chaos, appeal, bribe) that forces a decisive final tactic. Closure is earned and legible, though the resolution relies slightly on the antagonist's convenient panic rather than a verified material proof.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on a "deus ex machina" (the aurora) to resolve the physical tension, leaving the protagonist as a bystander to the central event. While the ending succeeds as a Conceptual Repricing—shifting from "fixing" to "reading"—the lack of causal agency in the lead-up weakens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (opening the box to find tools) lands effectively under the Causal lens. However, the mechanical logic of translating "azure light" into a tactile "click" on a broken tumbler is convenient and relies on a slightly magical correspondence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative relies on significant time compression ("Days turned into weeks") that violates the short-story scope preference for continuous scenes. The causality is strained by conveniences, particularly the zinc postal plate acting as a literal physical key for a botanical vault, which lacks logical setup. Closure arrives via a "placard of explanation," reducing the weight of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist succeeds exactly as intended without complication or resistance. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the goal is achieved with no unforeseen price—lacking the requisite "felt cost" or "conceptual repricing" needed for closure validity. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the accumulation meets no obstacles to create narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident and decisive closure that lands with visible cost (leaving safety). The central mechanism—transforming abstract "echoes of anxieties" into physical chaos capable of destroying a dome—strains causality within the sci-fi frame, reading more like magic realism. Despite this, the structural pacing is strong and the ending feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mystery resolution relies on extreme convenience, with neighbors providing the exact necessary clues immediately upon Elias sitting down. The mechanism of a tenant modifying a rental mailbox with a custom star-shaped lock breaks verisimilitude and creates a contrived puzzle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, moving cleanly from the recursive knot to the realization of the dice's purpose. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the lab's state, though the pivotal moment relies on a rapid intuition that feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative follows a linear causal path (desire → ritual → success) that results in "symmetric satisfaction," a key anti-pattern. The ending validates the protagonist’s initial hypothesis without exacting a toll, lacking the required "felt or conceptual cost" for high-band closure. The resolution feels earned by procedure rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of intent-to-execution (Plan > Ritual > Success) with no decisive change or complication to alter the trajectory. The closure explicitly negates cost ("The origami wing... was unchanged," "Elara... work done"), failing the cost proof test required for a high-band resolution; it reads as a success-state vignette rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure reconfigures the relationship, but the climax relies on a low-resistance monologue where the antagonist simply explains the mystery. The revelation is delivered via exposition rather than discovered through active struggle or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal arc is solid, moving from the shell's activation to the integration of memory with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, though the linear progression meets little resistance beyond the protagonist's initial hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal arc is clean and the "single scene" scope is managed well, leading to a legible Decisive Change (the edited Covenant). The mechanics of the forgery create a satisfying, logical closure, though the narrative path is linear without significant orientation debt or structural surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative halts to explain its own mechanics ("This was the method... progressive disclosure") rather than letting them unfold organically. The resolution hinges on a convenient "lock-and-key" trope where the protagonist finds a slot matching her prop, lacking causal pressure or earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent but linear, relying on a low-cost resolution where the protagonist’s power easily solves the problem. The closure is positive but lacks the "felt or conceptual cost" required by the rubric; the antagonist simply dissolves without forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear, coherent arc with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure where the protagonist returns to his station with an altered perspective. The causality is sound, though the "response" from the fireflies is conveniently ambiguous, fitting the quiet stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear and the investigation proceeds logically to a valid Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the narrative relies on a summary montage ("For three days...") to bridge the gap between discovery and solution, which flattens the dramatic tension of the investigative process.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality breaks significantly at the climax: the protagonist does not solve the central puzzle; the storm opens the locked chest for him via luck ("seemed to jolt the lock"). The resolution is a "lightswitch ending"—a spoken broadcast instantly stops a meteorological storm—which feels unearned and disconnects the physical stakes from the thematic action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative structure, gathering distinct sound-elements to build a specific effect. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the box isn't fixed but transfigured—making the before/after state legible and satisfying within the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean causal arc with a distinct tactical pivot ("adapt" vs fight) that drives the resolution. Closure lands effectively with a legible physical cost ("sweat-soaked"), satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the plan works perfectly without complication or unexpected variables. The closure lacks a legible on-page cost, as the victory is achieved cleanly through waiting and execution.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is tight, moving from a standard investigation to a supernatural realization that forces a professional deviation. Closure is decisive; the choice to document the "complex truth" acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration of his relationship to authority.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a clear Conceptual Repricing (shifting from fixing to guiding), fulfilling the closure requirement. However, the epiphany is delivered via a monologue rather than earned through active dramatic struggle, making the resolution feel slightly too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and efficient, moving from observation to epiphany to fabrication to high-stakes test. The closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change (a new physical law) that is distinct from mere flying, landing the specific "Grip" concept with earned impact.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from clue to resolution with a decisive closure (sending the file). The leap from random numbers to celestial coordinates to a password relies on convenient puzzle-logic rather than character agency, but the structure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" resolution where a supernatural object conveniently provides a video replay of the truth, bypassing the need for investigation or difficult choices. The ending is tidy and unearned by struggle, resolving the central tension without imposing any price on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc, moving from trawling debris to the climactic sound of the ice. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration, but the resolution feels "gifted" by the environment rather than earned through protagonist agency; she simply waits until the setting delivers the epiphany. The linear structure works for a vignette but lacks a complicating turn to deepen the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a standard reflective vignette structure where a physical object triggers a memory reframing (Conceptual Repricing). While the closure leads to a valid shift in stance (from guarding to tending), the narrative relies heavily on flashback summary rather than active struggle in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is solid and linear, moving efficiently from the inciting irritation to the ritual solution. Closure is achieved through a "Task Accomplished" beat (Earned Stasis), but the cost ("staggering mental weight") is abstractly labeled rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story operates as a linear vignette without causal drive or tension; the "healing" effect is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through on-page action. Closure is achieved by simply finishing a task, lacking the required decisive change or felt cost necessary for narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing (refusal to publish). However, the "weeks" summary bridge dilutes the causal tension; the epiphany ("finally able to decode") is reported as a result of time passing rather than dramatized through a specific, high-pressure breakthrough beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, tight arc where the central deficit (forgetting) acts as the primary complication, forcing a resonant reconfiguration at the climax. The closure is excellent: the shift from "capturing" to "becoming" satisfies the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) with a legible conceptual repricing of the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting vibrations to the diagnosis and the radical solution. The closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the problem is solved by fundamentally altering the system's purpose (clock becomes monument). The "escape velocity" logic provides a sturdy bridge between the problem and the specific solution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain (diagnosis → investigation → intervention → reunion), but the progression lacks resistance. The "flawless goodbye" is achieved with almost procedural ease, resulting in symmetric satisfaction where the outcome feels inevitable rather than earned through complication. The closure lands clearly, but without a felt cost or significant deviation from the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear causal chain that effectively delivers the required closure through a &quot;Eureka&quot; moment. However, the resolution feels low-cost because the solution is achieved through intellectual deduction (relearning) rather than overcoming active resistance or paying a price in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal: discovery leads directly to a reconfiguration of the protagonist's reality. Closure is decisive and resonant, utilizing the "bone setting" logic to map the new reality. The pacing moves efficiently from the garden's physical sensory details to the study's conceptual resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure focused on the process of creation. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the climax relies on external magic (the twilight beam activating the glass) rather than a causal result of the protagonist's agency alone. The pacing is meditative, but the lack of complications or setbacks makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from textural observation to a decisive intervention. The closure—trading the symbol of permanence for flow—lands with genuine conceptual weight (Conceptual Repricing) and visible cost (the pendant), effectively anchoring the "rust to life" arc.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration via the burial) is legible and structurally sound. However, the causality is strictly allegorical; the release follows the ritual mechanically without complicating factors or unexpected costs.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear "success sequence" lacking causal friction or resistance; the ritual works simply because the protagonist executes it. The ending fails the closure cost test entirely—there is no visible or felt price for the magic, only a symmetric, purely beneficial resolution. The plot feels like an anecdote of competence rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, structuring the ritual as a coherent arc from waiting to release. Orientation is excellent, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the legible cost of his own "stillness" and physical pain. The structure is effective, though the lack of complications during the ritual makes the progression feel slightly linear and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic: observe, understand, repair. However, the ending relies on symmetric satisfaction—the machine is fixed exactly as intended with no complication or trade-off. While the closure is legible, the lack of a felt cost or twist in the outcome limits the narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual (sensing, processing, depositing) without a decisive causal turn or complication. While the closure—placing the stone and deepening the silence—is legible under an Accumulative lens, the lack of opposition or risk makes the sequence feel like a vignette rather than a full story. The "shingled hush" framing provides structural symmetry but lacks a "before/after" value shift with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is solid, effectively using the kettle's boil time as a constraint to frame the flashback and the resulting action. Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the physical act of carving the "exhale" anchors the internal shift, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is solid, with effective orientation and a clear causal chain from the discovery of the object to the memory. The closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Kael’s purpose from bargaining to witnessing. The mechanism of digging a physical object out of "crystallized condensation" is a slight leap in logic for an audio-sieve, but it fits the surreal physics established.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line from discovery to activation, with a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the plot relies on conveniences (compatible generators, a slot that perfectly fits the sextant) that lower the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and orientation is immediate. Closure lands with a legible action (leaving the bells), though the linear progression lacks significant causal friction or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The reliance on "instincts" to locate a specific underwater target acts as a causality shortcut, bypassing investigation. The discovery of a journal that explicitly narrates the backstory creates an "explain-everything" ending, reducing narrative tension and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story functions as a coherent atmospheric vignette, but lacks strong causal drive or a decisive turning point. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing of the rope as philosophy, yet without a legible cost or risk paid on the page, the closure feels like a gentle observation rather than a resonant narrative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The structure is linear and relies on a "magic button" solution (psychometry) to resolve the central mystery immediately. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end (death as cartography) is clear, it is arrived at through passive viewing rather than causal struggle or earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story relies on heavy summary ("For weeks," "Days bled into a sleepless haze") to bridge the gap between assembly and hatching, violating the single-scene default and diluting tension. This compression flattens the rising action into a montage, robbing the climax of the accumulated pressure that a continuous timeframe would have provided. Causality holds, but the pacing is uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The circular structure works well, and the closure—severing the coin to bind the tree—is a decisive, resonant action with cost. However, the narrative elides the actual fire ("After the main blaze was subdued"), skipping the crisis of the event to focus solely on the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "ritual success" path with no reversals, complications, or unexpected deviations. While the orientation is clear, the closure—fixing the city—arrives without the required felt or conceptual cost, reading as a mechanical completion of a backstory task rather than a dramatic event.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear path where the encounter with the gear serves as a distinct catalyst for the climax. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's method ("pinging"), effectively resolving the central conflict. The pacing is steady, though the epiphany feels slightly rapid given the eons of backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The accumulative structure is coherent, but the climax relies on the storm as a convenient pathetic fallacy that mirrors the internal state without generating causal friction. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but the path there feels associative rather than earned by narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is static, relying on a "vision" trope where the protagonist enters a trance and exits feeling better without external consequence; the closure is an internal reset rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot relies on a "magic key" logic where pulling a single thread perfectly reveals a celestial route on a separate chart, straining causality beyond the established tone. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the mystery is solved cleanly—but lacks the required cost or trade-off to make the resolution resonant. The ending is tidy but emotionally inexpensive.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a coherent single scene that adheres to the "moment before" timeframe, creating a focused if static narrative. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (starting the work) with established conceptual cost, though the lack of external movement or interaction limits the dramatic energy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative operates as a linear vignette (Accumulative lens) rather than a causal sequence, lacking a sharp turn or complication to escalate the scene's immediate tension. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end—revealing the orchestra as unknowing revolutionaries—is a strong satisfying image, the path to it is friction-free.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ritualistic structure provides a clear, functional spine, and the "vanishing point" concept lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the mid-story explanation of the "lie" relies on heavy exposition that slows the causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Situational drive holds firmly, using the girl's arrival to force a crystallization of Silas's stance; the closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration where he accepts his role as "memory" with visible emotional cost. The structure is efficient, though the inciting arrival is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a &quot;soft reset&quot; resolution where a deep sociological conflict is solved instantly by a breathing exercise. The ending lacks a visible, felt cost; the &quot;generations of animosity&quot; evaporate for the sake of a tidy, symmetrical conclusion, undermining literary realism.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is linear and coherent, with a clear inciting incident and legible closure. However, the progression lacks friction; the pruning succeeds without resistance or complication, reducing the sense of earned causality or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path with a low-resistance resolution; Lena accepts and solves the riddle immediately, neutralizing tension. The reveal relies on a "told" explanation of the drones' biology rather than a demonstrated discovery, making the closure feel unearned. The central mystery is resolved via exposition rather than causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the narrative arc is clear, the closure is overly tidy and lacks a legible cost. The neighbor's immediate, visible transformation (the flamingo) the very next day is a convenient resolution that bypasses necessary causal resistance, making the victory feel unearned and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal lens where the revelation of the "structural weakness" as a "gill" forces a re-evaluation of the mission. Closure is a definitive Decisive Change (burying the weapon) that physically enacts the conceptual shift, satisfying the 9+ standard for constraint-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight, moving from the mathematical setup to the catalytic roll and the resulting rupture. Closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration; the return to the stairs with a shifted perspective ("prison" to "canvas") is earned and conceptually distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, functional arc from preparation to execution. However, the closure—a symmetric, immediate validation from the external world—feels convenient and lacks the friction or twist required for higher-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is complete but relies on a fragile causal pivot: the leap from baking bread (warmth/creation) to sonic resonance (physics) is logically tenuous and bridged only by a sudden memory. The resolution is too convenient; the "thaw" is achieved instantly without complication or cost, making the ending feel unearned despite the structural closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from preparation to execution with a clear inciting window (low tide). The closure is a valid Decisive Change with a legible cost (erasure), but the scene lacks a "micro turn" or complication; the execution proceeds exactly as planned without testing the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is solid, moving linearly through the funhouse to the central confrontation. The "dream dictionary" functions as a convenient guide, bordering on deus ex machina, but the logic of the climax (emptiness cannot be consumed) provides a satisfying Conceptual Repricing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is linear and the resolution—using the charcoal sketch and mallet to harmonize the storm—feels convenient, operating as a "magic wand" without complication. The closure is legible as an Earned Stasis (survival), but the lack of a twist, failure, or significant sacrifice flattens the dramatic tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight and effective; decoding the light directly leads to the climax. The closure is excellent, offering a "Conceptual Repricing" where the history of the Gate and the Watchers is inverted (protection becomes quarantine) with undeniable stakes. The pacing moves assuredly from mystery to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is legible and achieves closure with the handover of the document, fulfilling the causal drive. However, the central turning point relies on convenience; the resistance is overcome too easily to generate the necessary narrative deepening for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path with a legible causal chain (current -> loss -> dive -> recovery). Orientation is strong. The structure is functional but somewhat episodic; the complication is resolved quickly with a single physical action, lacking a deeper complication or "micro turn" that would elevate the tension before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is flawless: the blackout (inciting incident) provides the silence and darkness necessary to reveal the truth via the moss, leading directly to the closure. The ending is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts the burden of a secret truth, shifting his entire purpose with legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure forms a clean, resonant loop, moving from the workshop to the basilica and back to the garden with clear purpose. The causal chain is solid, with the physical journey mirroring the internal processing of grief. The closure—folding the crane—neatly pays off the established motivation with a meaningful reconfiguration of his state.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is cleanly structured around the "cooling" window, providing effective urgency. While the resolution—finding metaphysical coordinates via mathematical input—strains causal credibility by treating metaphor as literal physics, it adheres to the story's internal logic and delivers a clear sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear puzzle-solution chain with no meaningful deviation or cost; the ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved perfectly with a "smile of profound peace." This fails the closure requirement for a felt or conceptual cost (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration). The "why" of the mechanism remains mechanical rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative drive is clear, and the closure—repurposing his talent to restore memory—is a strong resonant reconfiguration. However, the climax relies on a causality leap: touching a gouge in driftwood inexplicably conveys complex technical information (that specific memory-erasure technology was used), functioning more as divination than a logical extension of his established skills.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, linear procedural arc with a legible Situational drive; the lockbox mechanism provides a solid pivot. Closure is clear (Earned Stasis), though the narrative lacks a sharp causal twist or complication to test the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from arrival to a "Charged Poise" closure that feels earned. The causal chain holds, though the inciting realization is somewhat mechanically triggered by the inserted prompt phrase ("direct command") rather than organic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is solid, delivering a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the compression of the investigation into summary ("Weeks of searching yielded a pattern") bypasses the opportunity to dramatize the method and lowers the narrative tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, moving cleanly from preparation to resistance to surrender. Closure is achieved through a decisive change (metamorphosis) and resonant reconfiguration (becoming part of the orchard), satisfying the causality established by the ritual. The pacing supports the escalation without drag.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative relies on a soft reset where a "different kind of truth began to settle" simply because she looked at the clouds. This lacks causal friction; the epiphany arrives ex machina to resolve the central tension without a decisive action or paid cost leading up to it. The closure is conceptually sound but structurally unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is executed cleanly, building pressure through the weight of the photographs to a clear Decisive Change at closure. Orientation is handled efficiently in the first paragraph, and the causality within the story's soft magic system is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies entirely on coincidence ("unknowingly orchestrated") and a convenient prophecy to generate meaning, lacking causal linkage derived from the protagonist's agency. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the environment magically resolves the tension, offering a gift rather than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, effectively utilizing the blackout as an inciting incident and the signal as a decisive closure. The plot mechanics (blackout -> sundial -> signal) are logical under a Causal lens. However, the progression is convenient; the obstacles (nervous captains, patrol) are easily skirted, resulting in a low-cost victory that feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a decisive closure. The resolution, however, relies heavily on the "star dust" artifact—a convenient tool introduced specifically for this moment—rather than Kael leveraging the unique mechanics of the setting or his skills, which softens the earned nature of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (mapping vs. developing), but the setup relies on a vague external promise ("timeframe he had been promised") that lacks causal grounding in the scene. The discovery of the envelope feels convenient, acting as a pre-arranged quest marker rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative arc is a clean linear solution to a puzzle, but the causal mechanism (reflecting needles to reveal code) relies on dream logic rather than mechanical plausibility. While the closure (question becoming a map) creates a valid Conceptual Repricing, the lack of struggle or trade-off makes the resolution feel like a forgone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation and setup are strong, but the climax relies on the convenient, immediate compliance of the strangers ("Can we help?"). This reaction resolves the central tension too easily, bypassing the need for Silas to meaningfully persuade or negotiate, which undercuts the causal power of the poem.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative is a linear problem-solution sequence (threat -> plan -> success) without a complication during execution; the ending lacks a felt cost since the alternative to leaving is mere oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a coherent arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (doubt integrated into faith). The resolution relies heavily on an internal realization beat that resolves the problem without external friction, and the final paragraph explains the thematic victory, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path but relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the compass mechanically resolves the protagonist's internal conflict without exacting a price. The causal link between the lace pattern and the compass instructions is asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving a gap in the story's logic. Closure is achieved through a soft reset—the guilt simply dissolves—rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wiped circle literalizes his decision to re-enter messy causality. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust pattern density re-weights stakes until the final image. Causal engine is intact: because the pane reveals transfer-of-life, therefore he abandons passive observation. Cost is unmistakable—“full of pain. And… full of purpose.” No orientation debt; transitions are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sealed, frost-etched pane reframes both the arson and her survival into a museum of acknowledged violence and reclaimed agency—cost is legible in the blurred charcoal ghosts. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of frost-cipher discovery tightens the stake once, then crystallizes in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 3; canyon, post-fire timeline, solitary POV stable throughout. No causal break; every beat (finding strip, frost mapping, kiln re-ignition) links by because/therefore under the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because she survived the capsize she seeks a new music; because she heat-maps the cereus she finds violet potential; because she fuses trauma with bloom the glass blooms pearlescent white. Orientation anchored by word 40. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—silence is no longer absence but “space where new music can begin”—with conceptual cost: exhaustion and the irreversible opening of both flower and memory. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is iron: lens arrival → recognition → folded descent → lens insertion → silence. Each beat narrows options and escalates cost (pressure as “thousand silent screams”) until the final image reweights the premise—stillness is no longer absence but curated history. No teleporting props, no outline drift; the astrolabe socket is seeded early as hollow, so the click feels inevitable yet surprising. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost: he trades lifelong noise for solitary exile beneath the world.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single bell-note crystallizes options and reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each food drop tightens trust until Elara’s public vow forecloses secrecy. Cost is visible in the empty food sacks replaced by seeds. No orientation debt; terra-cotta arbor anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “sparks” image reweights the premise that love is never unused. Causality is soft—inhale/exhale pattern is poetic but not a true constraint; the tear’s luminescence is a late rule tweak. Orientation is clear by 90 words; one transition inside the single scene is fluid. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, holds.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is iron: fragment found → memories siphoned → maze geometry weaponized → self-erasure. Hyperbolic maze seeded early as both setting and tool, then crystallizes in the decisive alignment that dissolves the fragment; cost is the total wipe of Elias’s past, felt in the final “no name” beat. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: time’s texture revealed as abrasive erasure, undeniable. Lens holds pure causal; no orientation debt; no prop teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: every defense activation is a because/therefore consequence of decoding the arrow-cipher. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: her body remains chained (persistent constraint) but the vault seeds are freed, reweighting the meaning of her decade in captivity. Cost is legible in the final image—“the cool iron of her chain a familiar comfort”—where the tactile reminder of captivity is the price she keeps paying. No orientation or lens ambiguity penalties apply; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4 and never jeopardize clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystal does not replay betrayal but houses its absence, rewriting the rule-set of memory. Causal chain intact—each poured silence compresses into the forge because Elias chose to hoard loss. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of absences escalates until the cadence shift (“He did not hear the awful sound…”) reweights stakes. Cost sentence: “His cells would continue to divide, but now, perhaps, they could finally begin to mend”—biological price legible. Persistent constraint: the crystal must stay inserted or the violet-grey returns.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: floral code → venue swap → jar retrieval → conceptual flip. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 wds and the green-glass canopy is re-invoked at closure, so the Orientation penalty is waived. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “he was no longer a thief… but the quiet custodian of possibilities” reweights the premise and carries undeniable ontological cost. One soft spot: the actual act of taking the jar is narrated in a single clause, so the decisive physical beat feels slightly elided, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: abandoning the sphere and catching sunlight on the bookmark reweights the premise (Earned Stasis with felt cost). Causal chain is tight—thaw destabilizes station → forces flight → collapse of art → bookmark as lever of thawed heart—though the “melting world” pressure is external rather than tactic-shaping; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with a single decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a crisp Decisive Change: the containment command triggers red lights and sirens, Julian’s smile flips to terror, and the shell falls silent—cost is visible and auditory. Causal chain holds: shell-whisper → library panel → cast cipher → pier sabotage; each beat tightens options. The “ten-meter drop” and “three days since” anchors arrive before the 120-word mark, orientation clean. One hairline slip: the emergency command is introduced as a forgotten failsafe only at the moment of use;虽然 earlier beats justify its existence, the reveal still feels slightly convenient rather than earned foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the completed glyph reconfigures the night from void to territory under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the single star’s extinction and the wind’s sigh—external indices of an internal price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no disorientation. Persistent constraint—the storm-sealed tower—shapes every tactical silence-summoning. Lens holds without waver; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: 8,192 twilight shards collapse into one crystallizing instant. Closure lands as Charged Poise—violin gone, loop broken, cost legible in the final “single perfect note” image that reconfigures meaning. Orientation taught by ~60 words; no causal breaks. Persistent constraint (temporal safeguard failure) shapes every tactic. Violin functions as pattern-teaching node; payoff reweights entire timeline density.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each ticket-image thickens the pattern until the cenotaph scene reweights the stake from suspicion to shared mourning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens transfer reconfigures silence into an audible offer, no words required. Causality is inside the metaphor system—doodles are not props but compressions of time/grief; no teleport or outline sequencing. Orientation anchored by word 60 (registrar’s desk, forecourt, after-hours).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: low luck → contest → hidden cure → commemoration → butterfly verdict → self-scarred trophy. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the new crack reweights the entire premise—numbers lie, gardens testify—and the price (his final purity sacrificed to honor imperfection) is visible in the conclusive image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: the hologram’s silver echo reweights the premise that time is linear, and the cost is the protagonist’s irreversible loss of a single life-story. Causal linkage holds: obliging temperament → accepts task → steady lever pull → lateral echo → forever re-calibrated worldview. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits inside 60 words; no drift. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint: the “mechanically warm” lattice energy lingers as tactile reminder that every moment is now adjacent; this shapes the final image of icy air as cradle.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: soaking the program rewrites the ghost’s silence into playable music, cost paid in the artifact’s destruction. Causal chain—stains incomplete → water completes → song revealed—holds. One transition (lanterns out, door open) is legible. Stakes could be sharper earlier; “unravel the code” is the only verbal stake, but the final image reweights it without cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each station sound (barograph click, ozone scent) layers density until the illustration reveal acts as pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the decision *not* to read the word crystallizes options and carries felt cost (“she could not bear it”). Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—the smudge she created—shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: confession → enters tunnel → hears clang → confronts wheel → shuts it, each beat a therefore linkage. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 20; no disorientation lingers. Closure—Decisive Change with cost: the ghosts quiet and narrator accepts lifelong weight, conveyed in the "bone-deep, earned exhaustion." Persistent constraint (he still carries guilt) shapes the final image and satisfies 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the keeper sits in stillness while the obsidian refuge and silent river re-weight every prior echo, the cost felt in the phrase “the peace would crumble again.” The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the final image; each sensory layer thickens until the silence becomes palpable. Causality is intact: the swan-fold triggers the burrow, the river triggers the release, the return is implicitly inevitable. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s hand closes tenderly, not desperately, re-pricing sixty years of sorrow into wonder; cost is the visible tear-streak under the corona. Causal chain holds: kalimba loop → eclipse → earth-touch → melody shift → new grip. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One soft spot: the “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” phrase is abstract and late, but it does not break lens (Accumulative/Textural) because the final image reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is lyric, not sequential—Elara’s burning, Kaelen’s finding, the dragons’ dying accumulate into one resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: the tapestry and diary side-by-side reprice imagination itself as spent currency. No causal loopholes; the “great bronze quiet” is Charged Poise, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: microdot arrival → fortune writing → cookie distribution → sugar-glaze transfer → keeper’s exit, each beat narrowing options. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses the keeper path, bag in hand, cost legible in the abandoned typewriter. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—his prophetic reputation—shapes every tactic. Minor elasticity: off-stage agents resolved by cookies, but causality remains internal to Elias’s orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the gray is just paint, the entity flees a suddenly plural universe. Causal lens holds throughout—each loop-layer is a because/therefore attack on the axiom of monochrome truth. Orientation is immediate (cube, anchor, pedal), no disorientation penalty. Cost is palpable in the vacuum after the master switch—silence becomes breathable again.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the map’s completion converts homesickness from lament to foundational note, with the cost of permanent fatigue legible in the final cookie slip. Causal chain holds—each memory-node tightens options until the dawn alignment forces the last stroke. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing viaduct greys into dawn, Kael lands, tablet turns to mud—cost is visible and felt. Causal lens holds: accepting the memory seeds the stable coordinate that ends the loop. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; later disorientation is taught and paid off. One micro scaffold: “procedural generation” is explained rather than shown, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the inverted bass vibrations accumulate density until the final “resonant stillness” reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by word 80; single-scene default met; closure is Charged Poise—“a silence that felt different now”—with felt cost (shared weeping, seasonal breath). No telegraphing; pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: watched → pigeon → impossible data → lateral infiltration plan. Orientation is clean within 50 words; courtyard dusk, cobblestones, apartment lattice anchor instantly. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the “storm-that-wasn’t” is now his private quest, solitude traded for subterranean risk; cost is the hush of velvet-blue evening turning into a whetstone. One micro-turn—parchment coordinates mapping air shafts—tightens options without external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens: because he fears smell-memory → therefore avoids scent → therefore visits greenhouse → therefore tests vial → therefore discovers Somniflora → therefore inhales/cries. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“humid air of the greenhouse”). Closure is a Decisive Change: he shifts from olfactory defense to deliberate inhalation; cost is the irreversible blooming that lasts “one and only” night.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias reframes the binary as false, electing to “stand in the doorway,” a charged poise that reweights the entire premise; cost is the solitude implied as the light assimilates around him. Causal lens holds: because he deciphers the pattern, therefore he rejects both options and claims the threshold. Orientation anchored by word 60; no spatial drift. One tight scene, no transition, single POV—meets default scope. No plot amnesia; rope image loops back to prison escape, paying off the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the droplet’s “magnificent” ping re-prices the entire premise—silence is no longer lack but vessel. Causal chain holds: because she absorbs silence, therefore she can gift it voice; the persistent constraint (hush must not shatter) shapes every tactic. Accumulated texture escalates through harmonic shimmers in dome and hull until the final image crystallizes options with unmistakable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern early—amber light thickens, static crackles—and reweights the stake through density increase: joy is decanted, sorrow left behind. Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of Kael holding the crystal phial crystallizes options—client gets lie, artisan keeps grief—felt cost is undeniable (“the cost of his empathy”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within first 60 words; no因果 break. Transitions are N/A—single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the plaque gift crystallizes a new, ongoing cycle and costs Elias capital plus emotional exposure. Causal lens dominates: mis-delivered envelope → correspondence → intel on David → grant; each step legible. One scene, one transition (rooftop arrival), anchors who/where by line 3; no orientation debt. Final image of tears catching starlight reweights earlier “salt air” motif, proving pattern taught early pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore—lonely reed-sculptor → joins search → discovers vine-tag → offers mats → invited to tend arbor. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 20; no disorientation claimed. Closure is Earned Stasis with felt cost: he forfeits exclusive artist-identity to become “part of the weave,” legible in the polishing-cloth hand-off. One micro-turn—Echo as collaborator, not vandal—reconfigures community myth without breaking prior rules.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lattice holds: interrupted canal cadence → sighting → pendant resonance → single-beat drip → restored waltz; every step is legible, motivated by Elias’s pattern-seeking vocation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the echo’s birthplace was the brief…silence” reweights his life goal without a speech. Cost is present—the city almost wakes, crystals almost shred him—but felt more conceptually than bodily; a hair’s-breadth shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice projection makes the “before” (formless ache) and “after” (patterned, nameable absence) legible with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each chip, crack, and glass-eye glow adds density until the final cadence shift crystallizes meaning. No causal tricks are required; the mosaic’s physical logic stays intact. The persistent constraint—the void remains framed, not filled—shapes the final image and forecloses easy catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias retreats into darkness while Anya’s gratitude floods the empty room, re-weighting both their worlds. The moment carries undeniable conceptual cost—his visibility is felt even though he is not seen. Causality holds: every beat from grate-loosening to label-aligning drives toward this crystallized final image. One minor scaffold (“he watched … he watched”) in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the linden leaf reweights the premise, cost is visible in the shift from hammer to saw. Causal chain (storm → snapped trellis → leaf → insight → tool choice) holds; no plot amnesia. One smooth scene, orientation anchored by breath on glass within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is “because/therefore” linkage—insomnia → rain → trail → dig → encounter → exchange. The Orientation Test is passed by line 5; geography and tide logic remain coherent. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the brooch leaves Elias’s hand, the story enters him, and the cost is the insomnia now repurposed into paint. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; the amber’s warmth against skin is the tactile cue that anchors the transfer of value.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s song changes, Lyra’s foresight is surrendered, and the price is audible in the new note. Accumulative/textural lens holds: each stutter or brightening of the cave re-weights the stake until the final pulse re-tunes the world. Orientation is swift—cave, noon, two characters—within the first 60 words. The causal chain is thin but coherent under an accumulative design; the decisive act is placement, not theft, and the cost is her emptied sight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final image of Kaelen turning back to the surf crystallizes both options—keep salvaging—and cost—he remains exiled in the liminal, buoyed yet bound. Causality is accumulative/textural: each fragment layers density until the trumpet valve becomes the pattern-break that reweights “absences” into shared memory. The cost is undeniable in the woman’s straightened spine—visible social repair paid for by Kaelen’s continuing solitude. Orientation, lens, and escalation hold cleanly across the two-shard window.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: each crack-vector → ticket punch → starlit vault tightens options toward the keeper cost. Orientation anchored by 78 words; seamless single-scene arc; punch-hole blackout is a crisp Decisive Change. Closure lands with conceptual price—mentor’s self-erasure becomes Elias’s future—visible in “accept a fare, a responsibility.” One causality micro-gap: punch’s rule-set never foreshadows energy-for-truth exchange, but pattern coherence survives.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the unheard symphony re-weights the premise, making whale-song and star-memory interchangeable. Causal chain holds—grandmother’s notes → storm-sharpened whale pattern → tile transcription → vision—each step narrows Elias’s options. Cost is palpable in the final sentence: “enduring rhythm of a love that spanned more than one lifetime,” a Charged Poise that forecloses his former rationalist stance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: solar storm → magnetic manipulation → spatial mutiny → amulet silence → rift. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: “a hole in the concept of ‘somewhere’” reweights existence. Orientation is taught by word 60 (“prismatic escondite pocketed away in the folds of reality”). No causal breaks; only micro-slip is one adverb cluster (“slow, deliberate step”) that slightly dulls final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is iron: father’s ink pot → forged death docs → smuggling the living as dead → graph-paper proof of fair trade. Each beat narrows escape options while raising moral cost, climaxing in the single most dishonest act of her honest life. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the dissolving ink mirrors the dissolving certainty that one life can repay another—under a steady Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant the sun extinguishes the lamp’s ghost-hum, Elara’s page becomes both artifact and gateway, reweighting the premise that paper can *be* time. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; each dawn adds density until the pattern break (sunrise) crystallizes meaning. Causality is tight—no arbitrary rules—every step from hum to pulp to gilded edge is forecast by method. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3, so no penalty; cost is the irreversible daylight loss of the carrier wave she alone can hear.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each overheard fragment layers density until the poison label is reweighted into a lived memory, then releases at the horn blast. Closure is the Charged Poise—container walls thin, memory is momentarily owned, then surrendered—leaving a felt after-cost of perpetual erasure. Pattern taught early (rhythmic layering), transitions legible (low tide → high tide → retreat), no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final image: “the quiet slap of water” against an emptied box.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each bow stroke tightens the search for a precise frequency that literally points to the scarred floorboard. Orientation is clean—observatory, night, workbench—within 120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty patch of floor reweights the entire quest, leaving Elias with a lifelong, solitary task. The cost is legible but lightly felt—more wonder than wound—so stops at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: the inspector leaves with contradictions, Kael keeps the stone, the Revel’s hidden order is now legible. Causal chain—graffiti plan → visible efficiency → inspector’s confusion—holds cleanly. Time/place anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. The “because/therefore” lens dominates; one meaningful tightening suffices. Cost is conceptual (Revel must keep living its double life) and visible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the summit stripped back to rock, the memory seared, the cost paid in irrevocable loss of the blooms. Causal linkage is tight—because he kneels, crushes, waits, the lilies rise; because the sun slices, they vanish. The hourglass grain disciplines time, the camera disciplines perception, each prop recurs with escalating stakes. No orientation debt; every anchor is planted by line four.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure thickens through sensory density until meaning ripens. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; anchors never drift. Closure is a Charged Poise: the now-still water and distant chain-clank reweight every prior flutter into earned stasis; the cost is the solitary stillness she accepts. Two microscopic skips—no explanation of how carbon wire rides the strut and a slightly convenient instant bond—keep it from perfect 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect CR: the frost-map reweights the entire premise—convergence is not a place but a witnessed phenomenon—so the story’s rule-set is repriced with undeniable conceptual cost. Because/therefore linkage holds: falcon’s return → barometric cue → condensation method → hydro-geological event. Mentor’s note and Lyra act as persistent constraints that shape tactics; cost (Elias’s life-work rendered trivial) is legible in the final image. Lens is causal and airtight to the last syllable.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each footstep layer adds density until the shimmer of ghost-baker appears as Charged Poise. Orientation is clean by line 3; the archway anchors place and the tuning fork signals the when (post-Collapse dusk). Closure lands with concrete cost: Elias must return “tomorrow, and the day after,” acknowledging perpetual labor; the hum that “settles into the ground” is the irreversible reconfiguration. No causal reversals are required under this lens; the cadence shift itself is the meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist’s death is imminent, the vial glows, and the meaning of “harness the ephemeral” is repriced into “become the ephemeral.” Causal linkage holds throughout—every beat either burns oxygen or tangles the psychic snarl tighter—until the final image fuses memory, object, and extinction. No teleporting props or convenient resets; the distress signal dies exactly when power flatlines, a persistent constraint that shapes the last quiet moment.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: gravity reclaiming the suspended bodies reweights the entire premise of inherited lies vs. witnessed impossibility. Causal chain holds—because he opens the door, the timeless tableau collapses and his stigma calcifies. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sightings + floral toxicity intensifies until knowledge transfer. Closure is Charged Poise: Lyra’s dissolution reconfigures Elian’s vocation with undeniable conceptual cost (“his work… was just beginning”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established by line 3; no penalty. Causality is thematic rather than plot-logical, appropriate to lyric mode. One tightening: Night Phalaenopsis bloom concentrates stakes; cost legible in Lyra’s vanishing and Elian’s toxic-scarred skin.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story escalates by layering dream-thread upon dream-thread until the storm’s wind “pulls them taut, humming,” a final cadence shift that reweights the entire canyon into a cradle. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the map now literally sings, the copper plate becomes living legend, and Kaelen’s private prayer is transmuted into communal sanctuary with felt cost—his blood still drying on the ropes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“bone-white memories jutting from the red canyon walls”) and the pattern is taught early; no causality breaks, no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ship-carving reweights the premise—interruption becomes perpetual beginning—at exact moment stone meets sun. Causal lens holds: every beat (wandering, freeing sundial, hoisting) is a therefore-link that narrows meaning toward that image. Cost is legible in her blistered palms and the irreversible placement of the stone. Orientation anchor who/where is taught by word 38 (“catacomb orchard”); no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed letter crystallizes a new life for an unseen stranger while Kaelen forfeits further control—felt cost is the slow, blind postal journey. Causal linkage holds: chalk codes → coordinates/date → envelope → surface mail; each step narrows options until analog trust is the only path left. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chalk grid fixes the meeting date, foreclosing digital channels. The ending image reweights the premise: anonymity is no longer data but paper and pavement.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the green glyph flashes, the stitched map is away, and Elara’s resumed stitching crystallizes both triumph and exposure with undeniable cost. Causal linkage holds: each earlier oddity (guards, Voronin, blackout, regulators) is threaded into the embroidered cipher and then into the three-minute uplink. The only hairline flaw is a two-sentence lag in the system that reads more like convenient suspense than engineered obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mist-written “sorry” evaporates, leaving Kael with the unalterable knowledge of why he stayed. The causal chain—shard pressed to glass → breath + name → condensation text → song → Kael’s recognition—tightens once and forecloses denial. Cost is legible in Elara’s sway and the moon she must now wait for. Lens is causal; every beat is “because/therefore,” no reset.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: each symbol decoded → therefore Varin’s facade cracks → therefore a tacit peace option emerges. Orientation is nailed by word 30; no anchor debt. The closure is a Charged Poise: the misted atrium now holds a father’s hand on his child’s head, re-weighting “enemy” as “parent.” Cost is legible in Elias’s relinquished advantage and Varin’s exposed throat-bob; no outline-like sequencing or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as an earned Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural dissolves but the “echo of its light” reweights the premise—joy is portable, not archival. Causal lattice holds: because he risks exposing the fresco fragment to the beam, therefore the image locks, therefore the memory arrives with cost. Orientation is clean (who/where/when inside daydream declared by word 30). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (fog ↔ dissolution) tightens to the final flicker.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the single mirrored nickel reweights every prior layer, making the multitudes he tasted legible at felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sonic refraction adds density until the cadence shift of the mirrored surface. Orientation is taught early via scaffold/sun-warmed brick; the dissolve at “world fell away” is purposeful disorientation that pays off. No causality breaks; the hobo nickel’s evolution tracks cleanly across awakenings.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: wilting flower → census threat → greenhouse → orchid sabotage → cognitive blackout, each beat a crisp because/therefore. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city-wide silence is the undeniable new state, Kaelen’s smile the felt cost. Slight bump: the seed’s parasitic power is revealed very late, so the orchid plan feels outline-declared rather than pre-seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the postcard flipped, inscribed, and embedded reweights her life-rule from “photosynthesize pain” to “honor the reef-shadow joy.” Accumulative lens holds—each poem-filled conch thickens pattern until the cadence flips in the final quiet. Cost is legible in the eternal wakefulness she embraces, now reframed as chosen vigil. Orientation is taught lyrically early; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each polished orchid adds density until the final chime crystallizes Simple Trust. Closure is a Charged Poise—the orchid’s glow reconfigures the gallery’s silence into an archived future that can never again be lived. Cost is legible in the “bitter taste” of foxglove regret that lingers after the chord dies. Pattern is taught by line 3 (“library above the clouds”) and never breaks; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: because silence has calcified into last-chance stakes, therefore Kaelen gambles on forbidden language; each glyph is a vow that could snap back on him. Closure is a decisive change: the lattice lifts, Elara steps in, silence is broken. Cost is explicit—the vial is empty, his blood is spent, the archive’s ambient magic could still detonate. The inferred lens is causal throughout and holds at the end without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The envelope→pollen/chain→cipher→letters chain is tight causal escalation; each step materially narrows options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kaelen sees love was present but encoded, and the price is the same self-sacrifice now required of him—“two parts of the same complex, vital machine.” Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is visible in the final image of him atop the tier, regulator gleaming, future loneliness legible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteorite’s re-gifting reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens, making the before/after of trust legible. Causality holds—storm → leak → confession → shared scroll—without convenient resets. The piece stays within single-scene default; orientation is anchored by ~100 words. Cost is felt in the raw-voiced “It was a gift” beat. A hairline slip: the tarpaulin moment is a touch rushed, blunting the full tightening that could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the white threshold crystallizes options and makes the cost of distance absolute. Causal lattice holds—each flare is cross-mapped to logbook code, turning spectral chaos into navigable forecast. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 4 and the drifting terrace keeps spatial logic consistent. The persistent constraint—colorless void and solitary chair—reweights the premise inside the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the meadow of jellies reconfigures meaning—belonging is shared wonder, not location. Causal chain holds: Kaelen’s months-long mapping → timed energy pulse → jelly arrival → Elara’s stance shift; sunrise deadline tightens every beat. Cost is legible: the city still collapses, the sub will leave, the feather keeps its scar, but isolation fractures. Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the shard becomes the traveler, reweighting “missing” into “chosen union” with visible cosmic cost (obsidian = meteor). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seed-sprout beat thickens the pattern until pattern-break = reveal. The -0.4 hesitation owes to a mild soft-reset: lines like “cheerful certainty” dissipate rather than pay the emotional price of knowing the traveler died. Still, the final image reconfigures stakes satisfyingly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mural’s momentary star-gleam reweights the arcade’s mundane decay with undeniable aesthetic cost. Causal chain (bishop → water → coin-pusher → projector → mural) is tight and visible; each beat advances the domino. The lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural, held to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the exile frame flips from isolation to cosmic conduit, cost etched in literal skin. Tension escalates along an Accumulative/Textural lens—gaps widen, starlight pools, obsidian blooms—each loop tightening the same stake rather than causal turns, fully earned by the pattern taught early. No orientation drift; anchors (twilight garden, scrying dust) surface inside 120 words and re-cohere at the end image. The only micro-slip: “he began to fledge” abstracts the exact beat of surrender; a sharp verb or image there would remove the hairline wobble keeping it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s dissolution reweights the premise that value resides in permanence. Causal lens holds: because he understands transience via interference rings, therefore he refuses to save the atrium. The price is the structure itself—thousand-fold rainbow becoming vapor—felt on the page. Orientation anchors within 50 words; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the box thickens the cost strata until the final crystallization. Orientation anchored by word 32 (“granite spine of the ridge”). Closure is Charged Poise: Kaelen’s finger on the fissure reconfigures both their stances; cost is the unreturnable box and the irreversible scar. Causal chain intact: fire memory → scar → box refusal → silence understood.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the gauge’s upward settle reweights the entire equation of hope with visible conceptual cost. Causal chain is tight—shell pattern → tide catalyst → gauge response—each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors arrive by line 3, lens (Causal) taught and held. The only hairline slip is the one-sentence flash of possible failure (“Had she miscalculated…”) that slightly softens the price before it is fully felt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the “burden of knowing” is left in the hearth, reweighting her prior maps. Causal chain holds: discovery of Prometheus → recognition of active harm → refusal to carry it. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early, cadence deepens, final image recharges. Cost is legible in the wave-form notation and the deliberate act of re-burial.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored glimpse layers possibility-density until the bell-cadence breaks the pattern, re-weighting stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—possibility seeded city-wide at the price of the painter’s own pulse returning “leaving him with only his own.” Orientation, causality, and cost all land on-page; no artifact touches the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias reframes peace as ritual, therefore the generals’ fatigue is weaponized into signatures. Each beat tightens options—appeal to history, celestial cue, dust sigil—until only signing remains. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: terrace, twin moons, clipboard, century convergence. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost: moons’ “unified light” dramatizes the irreversible political shift cemented by dust and ink.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the egg’s proteins diffuse into the brine, reweighting the drought-world’s rule-set—life will never sound again, yet Vance has seeded the lost potential. Causality is lyric-accumulative: every salt crack he mapped, every river he bled, funnels to this single surrender. The distant thunder promised at the start returns as the final image, tightening the loop with felt cost. No lens ambiguity; the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last shimmer of shell.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s masters receive their own untangled truths, reweighting the social rule-set while Elara pays with the decade-long burden she finally releases. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each harvested echo layers density until the silent flash reconfigures meaning. Causality is thin—no beat shows why *now* is the moment—but the pattern is taught early and the final image carries undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the campfire stick becomes a baton passed back to himself, crystallizing a new artistic stance that accepts narrative responsibility without abandoning ambiguity. Causal linkage holds: Elara’s absence → stick on floor → doubt → decision to stage a second puppet show that complicates the first. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts via recursive re-reading of carved symbols and memory of the hollow-eyed patron. Cost is legible in the final image—“point toward the dawn”—which promises sleepless labor and possible further failure. Orientation is anchored inside the dome by line 3; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each woven arch adds density until the final sparse butterfly reweights the silence. Closure is a Charged Poise—"a soft place for the dying light to land"—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation and causality remain intact; no prop or knowledge teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sigil’s dissolution reweights the premise—memory can be honored even when retrieval is impossible. Causal lens holds: every re-braid is a because/therefore response to the punched card’s absence-of-paper code; the final silver sketch is therefore motivated. Cost is patent in the image “ghost of a ghost” and the quiet acceptance of partial victory. No orientation drift; ice/aurora anchors arrive within 60 words and serve the closing light effect.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: eating the key reweights the entire premise—directive was chrysalis, not order. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of past/future shards crystallizes in one charged present image. Cost is unmistakable: “He simply was” while the bunker drowns him. No causality breaks; every vision is anchored to present tactile cues.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the new star-cloud reweights the premise, making his solitude and secrecy priceless. The causal chain—tile → schematic → star-collision—lands with felt cost: he forfeits plundered gold and court power forever. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the sky itself is re-tuned. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchor within 50 words and payoff justifies early compression.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmonic hum inside the cells rewrites the physical law Vale once enforced, and Elara’s extinction is the felt cost. Causal chain holds—broken pin → memory invasion → sanctuary tear → catalyst light → song restored—each beat narrows options. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory memory escalates until pattern breaks into sound.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the mirror empties, the frost mountains collapse, and she pockets the sextant—conceptual cost legible in the shard-glitter and the new map she can now “read.” Accumulative lens holds; each breath adds frost density until pattern crystallizes, then shatters. No causal gaps; broken instrument, stump, fog, and breathing chain cleanly. Orientation anchored within first 90 words; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the council fires him → he trespasses; because ribbon/seed memory strikes → he abandons sealing and instead sponsors growth. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed by line 3, well before 120 words. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the silk becomes a splint, not a seal, and the cost is the public forfeiture of his old mender identity (ribbon left behind). One micro-softening: “accidental wisdom” moment is slightly abstract, but the next sentence re-grounds it in the seed act, so no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each poetic graft of orchard imagery thickens the same temporal paradox until the blank cameo reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—emptiness reframed as reverse inheritance—legible in the final sentence. Cost is oblique but undeniable: Kaelen’s bewilderment is “polished to a gleam,” a felt erosion of self. The piece meets 9- gate but lacks persistent constraint that shapes tactics, capping high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: Kael’s collapse → Elara’s diary hunt → silence wall → renegotiation → root stairway, each step narrowing options. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s chord and living staircase reweight the entire Scriptorium’s hoarding rule-set with undeniable social cost—knowledge must be used, not caged. The silence wall earlier is the taught disorientation that pays off at closure, so orientation debt is waived. Cost is legible in the final image: she descends carrying the diary and the weight of all futures.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the Garden is not found but founded, and the price is the “clean, cold loneliness” that snaps her memories back into brittle singularity. Causal chain holds: each swatch touch rewrites her past → narrows future options → forces the final reframing. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one transition (midway to bridge) is telegraphed by pilgrimage language. No plot amnesia; the darkest swatch delivers the promised womb-origin and ends the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens is crystal: because the door appears at the thirteenth chime, therefore Elias retrieves the seal, therefore he unbraids the rope; each linkage tightens until the last knot rewrites reality. Closure is decisive: the mahogany door + brass handle is the visible cost, the “fables of absence” file now has a physical annex. Orientation, stakes, and time-seam rules are anchored by ~100 words; no teleporting props, no retro-fills.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as an earned Charged Poise: the hush blooms, alien noise is folded away, and Kaelen’s hard-won stillness pulses back at him with visible cost—stone light steadies, his body settles into “earned repose.” Causal chain (hum → ice-map → release → inversion) is airtight; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Lens is causal throughout; orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3 and never loosens. The final quiet reweights all prior sonic torture without tidy exposition—exactly the resonant reconfiguration required.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each star-track calculation is a because/therefore that narrows to the keystone insertion. The closure is a Decisive Change—silence → pulse—paid for by the swallowed loneliness of generations, visible in the misted breath. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no teleporting props or knowledge cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the fog shifts from prison to monument, re-weighting the entire premise with undeniable social cost. Causal lens holds: storm → crystal resonance → shadow measurement → memory reveal → archival decision, each step shrinking options. The persistent constraint—he must now guard the silence he once wanted to break—locks the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-teach at 25 % (chemical chant → color chant → filter logic) coheres; closure is Charged Poise—he exits with knot in hand, silence reweighted as canvas, cost legible in “first time in months” smile. Orientation anchored by word 80. No causal break; escalation is density/cadence shift, not reversal. Persistent constraint: starless hush remains, now repurposed.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece deepens by density, not causal reversals. The grotto, snail, and cicada accumulate into a pattern break that reweights the stake from loss to transition. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “time changes its song” crystallizes options with felt cost—she accepts the shedding. Orientation is clean by line 4; no ambiguity or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly: the inversion hour grants a Charged Poise—he returns carrying the trellis’s spacious silence, so the bunker room is reweighted from coffin to precipice. Causality holds: because inversion is finite, the cost (inevitable descent) is baked into the very magic that frees him.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer thickens the hush until the passenger’s stance reconfigures. Orientation is immediate; causality is pattern-based rather than event-based, taught early and held. Closure lands as Charged Poise—her softened voice reweights the silence—cost is the shared exposure of interior states. No breaks or ambiguity; pattern is paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: because she remembers the Old-World resonance, the curtain tears; because she peels every palimpsest layer, the star-indent reveals; because she inserts the Heartstone shard, the throne acknowledges sovereignty without a body. Sunrise tracks the ticking clock, each violet sentence tightening the final option until the staircase dissolves—an Earned Stasis where refusal of rule saves culture. No teleporting props, no off-stage resolution; even the purge threat is tethered to the chronometer’s pulse. The closing image reweights sovereignty itself from corporeal to mnemonic, paying the conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bolt stabilizes the Promise, pressure becomes diamonds, cost is the permanent loss of that psychic weight—felt in the “steady breathing for the first time in years.” Causal lens holds: bolt-tipped choice directly reshapes world and self. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by sentence four. Single micro-turn—volunteering to approach—narrows options believably. Glitch-text set-up pays off in the final “Well done,” sealing lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each crank turn tightens possibility space until conceptual breakthrough lands with undeniable emotional cost. Orientation is swift (“sepia reading room”, “first yawn of evening”). Closure—the realization that dismantling was mercy—reweights every prior echo; the silence replacing the hum is the felt price. No teleporting props or broken chains; the globe pedestal is Chekhov-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean CR: clasp release → conceptual repricing of ‘possibility’ with felt cost (“shivering bliss”). Causal lattice holds: failing equations → program → dance → clasp sever → orchard reborn. Orientation anchored by word 50; lens (Causal) inferred early and held. Minor waver: the asterisked “now” beat could use a half-line more setup to nail timing inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the button’s rehousing reweights Elara’s grief into archival stewardship. Causal chain is clean—dust pattern → unfold → button → inscription → archival act—each step narrows her emotional options. Cost is visible: she forecloses the easier path of cataloguing anonymity and accepts custodianship of someone else’s fragile link. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; the final cadence deepens rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: network silence ➔ puddle-map ➔ lagoon booth ➔ broadcast crack. Each beat is a “because” that narrows her options until the only remaining path is the lever. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 40 (apartment, 18:43, Directorate news). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the golden pulse reweights reality for the whole city; the cost is the irrevocable exposure she accepts in the last image. Minor quibble: the broadcast’s effect is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Earned Stasis: the last echo vanishes, dewdrops hang “perfect,” the prophecy is foreclosed, and the price—perpetual lonely vigil—shines through the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each saxophone phrase thickens the hush until the cadence shift (random drips restored) reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the path to the grotto was visible only to him”). No causality or world-rule breaks; the crystal’s sympathetic vibration is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: leaf falls → anomaly found → prod → world awakens, each beat tightening possibility. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pearlescent soak re-weights every prior leaf, and Elian’s shimmer carries undeniable cost. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where) arrive ~130 words—just late enough to notice, but the later payoff justifies the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the celestial mist reframes navigation itself as irrelevant, reweighting Elias’s life-long premise. Causal chain holds: each cog discovery tightens the path; the greenhouse etchings skew navigation, forcing the improvised pivot that unlocks the stairs. The final image—“phantom galaxies swirl and dissolve”—makes the conceptual cost undeniable: he pays with his former identity as fixer. No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern taught early (cog → cog → rose) converges on the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: every beat because/therefore tightens options—search party leaves, therefore he stays; furnace roars, therefore memory distills; coin cracks, therefore grief transmutes. Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the golden seam pulses with undeniable conceptual cost—memory is redeemed, not reversed—reconfiguring meaning without exposition. Orientation, transition, and prop tracking are flawless; no causality break touches the final image. Meets 9+ quick test with persistent constraint (spent energy) shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the warped harp tightens the acoustic texture until a single remembered laugh snaps the pattern. Causality is atmospheric rather than plot-based—memory literally rewires the spectral instrument. Orientation is swift: precipice, mist river, hidden sunrise within 50 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gorge’s new silence is felt as loss and gift simultaneously, the price being Silas’s renewed solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the forest reveals itself as lab, the strap converts from scar to tool, and mercy is reframed as a missing variable rather than an ineffable grace. Causal lens holds: every beat links “because they enhanced him / therefore he can read the forest / therefore he stays to solve.” Orientation is anchored by word 40 (moss, violet light), so no penalty. Cost is legible in the final line—he now *needs* the question, a life-sentence of inquiry—meeting the 9+ test even if the turn is quiet rather than explosive.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painting’s surface re-set, the crew acknowledged, the lens loses weight—cost felt in that exhalation and irrevocable change of the object’s heft. Causal chain holds: wrong painting→lens reveal→unfastening→truth breathed into present. Orientation (who/where) is clear before 120 words; rooftop market, shadowed tent, single POV. No teleporting props or retro-patches; every beat grows from the last.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: power-cut → ghost materializes → dust asymmetry → ladder → brass → release. One continuous scene anchored by ~70 words; no orientation debt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s thinning silhouette makes the before/after legible and charges Leo’s quiet life with new, unspoken weight. Cost is visible in the final fist-clench around the barrel and the hush that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each frost-branch sentence thickens the texture of collapse until the pane dissolves. The rupture is the decisive change; the Operator’s consciousness diffusing into everything is the resonant reconfiguration. Causality is lyrical rather than sequential, yet every beat is tethered to the whisper-frost trigger. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the library’s perfect stasis is forfeited forever.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s absorbed visions re-price the republic-of-reason war as a quieter war of interpretation; cost is the reopened wound of irrelevance. Causal lens holds: because he covers mirrors, therefore the shard stays exposed; because it drinks the storm, therefore the new evidence exists. Orientation clean by 60 words; single-scene default met.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: chip dims → doubt → self-realignment → tether → blue slit in sky, each beat a because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s tuning is restored but Elias is left leaning against the machine, exhausted, the cost felt in that quiet physical image. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One causal hairline: the rust-sentience voice is introduced mid-scene without prior seed, but it functions as externalized pressure rather than off-stage fix, so the linkage holds.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: each sensory fragment layers until the lagoon reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks away carrying “the resonant hush within her,” a crystallized re-weighting of her life’s taxonomy. The price is the forfeiture of capture itself, made legible in the final sentence. No causality breaks; the hinge-door and compass stillness are cleanly prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is pristine: because she finds the slide → cranks it → sees the ancient pattern → replicates it, the wave is deflected. The lantern image is the Decisive Change; the receding water and first-dawn hush deliver Charged Poise with felt cost—her sanctuary half-destroyed, her art forever redefined. Micro-turn inside the climax (panic → clarity) tightens options. No orientation debt; who/where/when locked by line 3. Lens held: every beat is because/therefore, no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each glass layer adds density and reweights the central stake—night-blooming as strength, not secrecy. Closure is a CR: the portrait reframes the entire quest as ancestral summons, undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; causality intact—each filter revelation is because/therefore linked to her escalating obsession. One clean transition (pavilion → cathedral) taught by postcard cue; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a CR: the coordinate reveal reweights the entire diary quest and carries undeniable conceptual cost—he must now bodily enter the site of Elara’s death. Accumulative lens holds: beach-art iterations tighten pattern until the final arrangement breaks silence. Orientation is taught early via zeppelin brass and salt-snap transition; no因果 breaks. One minor scaffold: “searing reverie” is repeated twice in adjacent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the first two lanterns ignite, re-weighting the cove from silence to “subtle counterpoint of whispers,” with the sealed bottle as persistent constraint. Causal linkage is interior but legible—because he channels memory, therefore light—held under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no props teleport. The cost is felt in the physical “weight upon his shoulders” and the lifetime commitment announced in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the foghorn redefined from beacon to sonic shield reweights the entire premise; the cost is the city’s future amnesia, legible in the funereal scent shift. Causal chain holds: Horn silence → wax cut → immersion → prophecy → scribe’s invert oath. Orientation anchored by line 9 (ancient orchard atop the Spire) and reinforced by sensory cues. No lens ambiguity; the drive is causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vortex’s re-song is legible, cost is the surrender of solitary identity to chorus. Causal chain is tight—acorn cap draws chaos because it is the first pattern—no teleporting props. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: density increases via remembered fragments until cadence flips to quiet thrum. Orientation clean by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: harmonic signal → doubt → rope discovery → power diversion → climactic pull. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3; no drift. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain sings, clouds part, and the cost is the irreversible loss of the old safety protocol—felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the silence accumulates density until it becomes “fertile,” then the meteor’s scream reframes it as resonant peace. The closure is a classic Charged Poise—Kael’s stance crystallizes without tidy resolution, cost felt in the whisper of cooling dust. Causality is intact: every beat of attention (glass to eye, arms tracing, empathic opening) is traceable to the final reconfiguration. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the heat-haze silence thickens until the lattice of light reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra’s nod and the dissolving ghosts make the before/after legible, with the conceptual cost that Elias must inhabit a haunted quiet forever. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“scorched wasteland… apiaries once thrived”). The reflective block (~23% of text) is interleaved with present action and cues micro-choice (kneeling, opening box), so BRR cap waived. One soft spot: the ten-year gap’s causality is asserted, not dramatized; hence not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shard-triggered memory floods Kael, re-configuring his stance toward death, and the cost is the irreversible dimming of his own remaining light. Causal chain holds: “garage-sale” lure → willow message → wall-panel resonance → timeless echo. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“emerald silo that hummed”). No teleporting props; the urn fragment states are tracked throughout. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the final cadence shift, satisfying escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the kite snap is the pattern break that reweights the dominant stake—beauty found in rupture. Causality is interior but legible: snapped string → feather found → poem braided → dawn woven. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parent–child dyad recedes while Kaelen pockets the feather, a tangible cost that forecloses his干预 and reframes loss as luminosity. No orientation debt; all transitions taught by image cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-build through copper lattice until cadence shift reweights stakes. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3 and tighten again when the ferry-engine prognosis is folded into the temple hush. Causality is lyric-sequential—each grafted branch thickens the texture rather than pivots plot—until the final insertion into stone fissure delivers the decisive pattern break and humming after-image. Closure is Charged Poise: the unified pulse is felt, Elias’s death implied but not declared, the cost legible in the viridian wire-glow that outlives him.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds from first sentence to last: because he wants to isolate the “chemistry,” therefore he walks; because the footprints pull, therefore he arrives; because the pattern is made, therefore he surrenders the amber. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—the amber left behind—and the lens never wavers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“trailhead”) and the single transition (trail→tower) is legible. No teleporting props or retroactive knowledge; the amber’s weight is present from line 1 and traded at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the planted jetty reconfigures the dead sea’s meaning while the lighter satchel makes the cost tactile. Causality is lyric-accumulative—each seed placed because a gull’s cry translated a ghost-current—so the lens holds. Orientation is swift: “stone finger pointing into the corpse of the sea” anchors us by line 3. One soft spot: the war guilt is told once (“a war he hadn’t fought”) yet never refracts back into present-tense doubt; the beat still lands but could bite deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cylinder re-prices from audio relic to seed-map, crystallizing “distance into closeness” at the sight of matching leaves. Causal spine: cylinder-smell → groove-reading → dog-compass → geothermal cave; each because/therefore step trims options until only nurturing remains. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within first 110 words via scrapyard dust, lean-to, hand-crank. Cost is felt: two-day water-starved hike, pivot from scavenger to steward, dog’s spent sigh—no tidy reset.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass rose is stripped of its promise, silence flips from oppressive to resonant, and Elara’s stance crystallizes in a single, unspoken choice to explore the boundless. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory pulse of the accretion disk, each charcoal line, each ancestral memory layers density until the pattern breaks open into the crystalline vision. Cost is legible in her gasp, numb fingers, and the forever-lost simplicity of “direction.” Orientation is taught by word 80; no debt incurred.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: wrong sky → climb → light trick → swap → seed released; each beat shrinks options and escalates exposure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Sylas’s sterile control literally hollowed out and replaced by chaotic growth—felt cost etched in his trembling palm and Kael’s lighter soul.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal linkage is tight: because Elara once performed grief, she can weaponize its authenticity; therefore the Regent flinches; therefore the key turns. Closure is a Decisive Change—door unlocked, prisoner freed—charged by the Conceptual Reprice that the board never had pawns. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers sensory density until the feather’s touch triggers the decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise—roots dream, rain scent—re-weighting prior phantoms with undeniable conceptual cost (“home was not a place to be found but a foundation to be laid”). One hairline slip: late intro of feather method after prior searching beats; still, pattern is taught by payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the solved sphere and un-woven hush reweight the premise—absolution is not erasure but the wisdom to play again. Causal lens holds: each thread isolated → labyrinth alignment → spell broken. Cost is legible in the rain breaking over him while he keeps his eyes closed. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Ossuary’s monolith-truth is publicly devalued by splintered echoes; the canyon’s new rule—“questions never die”—carries undeniable social cost as guards seize her. Accumulative lens declared at line 5 (“woven from silence and fear”) holds: each poem seed layers density until the pattern break (shattered echo) re-weights stakes without causal leap. Orientation complete by 78 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost crystallized in final image: Elara smiles while footsteps “found her,” a Charged Poise that forecloses silence forever.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the golden pulse reweights the rule-set—history is not erased but made beautiful, paid for by her exhalation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scar-filled beat intensifies density until the final light-shift reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact—every binder thread forecloses alternatives. Cost is visible in the lung release; no telegraphing or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shell settles, re-weighting the premise—he keeps the memory but returns the object to the world. Causal chain holds: wrong turn → discovery of oasis → ritual completion → felt unburdening. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and tighten inside the cave; no penalty. Persistent constraint—the unreachable pool—shapes the only possible gesture (release, not retrieval) and charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain: because Elias believes the lens can filter intent, therefore he risks the vial; because he releases the scent, the freighter finds a path—earned, not coincidence. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the captain’s sensory echo re-prices the premise, proving whispers travel. Orientation is clean by line 10; the single transition (dawn arrival) is legible. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the captain’s garden-memory line. The beat could tighten further: the ship’s arrival drifts slightly toward fait-accompli rather than last visible beat of Elias’s will.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each midnight call therefore tightens the build; the final placement of the bronze ignites the signal. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (starlit station, 00:00). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s tear-streaked face under the cold pulse shows conceptual cost: he becomes lighthouse, not rescued father. One soft spot: “frequency of solace is the weight of the bronze” is stated, not shown beforehand, a micro teleport, but it is paid off instantly and does not break chain.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because he is truth-compelled, therefore he seeks the relic; because the storm supplies turmoil, therefore the attunement works; because the eye absorbs the memory-stream, he can now answer partially. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—his first voluntary silence—landed on the page in the final line. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (hanging orchard, storm, solitary house). No teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: ant traces → fissure → chip-triggered arch → mirror of lives → renunciation, each step because/therefore. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the doorway dissolves, foreclosing alternate lives, and the cost is felt in the image of “blooming shadows.” Orientation is clean by line 4; lens stays causal throughout. One tightening: rising creek clock limits access, forcing the final now-or-never choice inside the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: dream-quest → mountain ascent → grotto temptation → renunciation → new custodial purpose. Orientation anchors (queen, dusk departure, ridge above clouds) arrive within 120 words. Closure is a Decisive Change: she forecloses self-annihilation and embraces guardian duty; cost is felt in the same breath that reconfigures her reign. No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens when starlight reveals erased identities.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: sterile sphere → Kael’s leaving → re-valued method → living sun gift, each step foreclosing options. The final image reweights the premise—“So you don’t forget what it feels like” lands Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (her palm now empty, his path gone). No orientation drift; twilight & Nexus sketched by word 60. Clean publish-now closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: accumulating images of time-fragments tighten until altitude re-orders them. Orientation anchored by word 60; no disorientation penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the aerial vantage reprices all selves as one map, felt cost in the hush after wing-beat. Persistent constraint—the undated grave—remains, shaping future chronicle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the clean, empty breath reconfigures her loss as gain with undeniable conceptual cost—she now measures life in liquid heartbeats she cannot smell. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each droplet, gear, and worn thread adds density until the screw’s history tips the emotional scale. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (fog, shop, father, clepsydra). No meaningful escalation beyond the single deepening, but that is sufficient under the 800-word default; cost is legible in the final image and ties back to the persistent constraint of scentlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because inks fail → therefore Elian tries naming; because naming proceeds → crystal softens. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost— the dust-cloud of pain literally leaves his body. Orientation anchored by line 3 (granite platform, suspended sky). No prop teleporting; crow quill purpose is re-weighted, not introduced late. Single transition (memory shard) is legible and pays off at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the acceptance that arrives is imperfect, expensive, and irreversible. Causal linkage holds—because Julian pays, therefore the bell answers, therefore the orchard’s erasure becomes bearable. The oscillator wires and perfume bottle are set up, used, and discarded in tight causal sequence; no prop teleports. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “sheet music archive” and the diesel engine growl at the end re-anchors time. Cost is legible in the final image: the bottle is once again “just an object,” a brutal re-pricing of what magic can and cannot buy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Mosaic structure (four braided shards) is taught by word 150; transitions are marked by spatial ring-count and tightening spiral, all legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the dropped dictionary reweights ‘arbitration’ from lexical entry to cosmic erasure, paid for by her vanished subjectivity—“an eternal, silent syllable.” Cost is unmistakable in the final image; the lens holds without ambiguity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately thinned but payoff is earned at closure, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds by density and pattern break (filtered glacial water birthing impossible ice). Orientation is anchored by word 60, pattern of hydraulic quiet taught early. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the glacier rewrites the machine from inside, forcing Elias to abandon correction for witness. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “his duty was not to tame… but to witness,” a charged poise that reweights his entire occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from sensing imbalance → building device → pressing button → release. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the air reverts to haze but the emotional rule-set is permanently altered—“he had finally let her go”—with cost legible in “profound exhaustion.” Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; one meaningful tightening at the button press that forecloses reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a lyrical CR: the lit lantern reweights the premise—risk is now beautiful, zero is the real gamble. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each subway glyph thickens pattern until the rail-yard balcony image crystallizes cost. Causal chain holds; no teleportation of props. Persistent constraint: the mica pane’s etched key literally shapes every ride she takes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is a because/therefore of semantic rewiring. Orientation is swift—concrete tunnel, antique phone, night-time—within first 60 words. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: “It felt like a pause” re-weights the silence-loop rule with undeniable conceptual cost—Silas remains frozen, the caller departs unfinished. Cost is legible but interior; no persistent physical constraint is activated, keeping it just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal spine holds: damaged photo → chemical restoration → ancestral revelation → joint epiphany. Closure is a CR-repricing: the jetty blooms, re-weighting a century of enmity; cost is conceptual (a culture built on a lie) and is legible in the final image. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only mild ellipsis links lab to jetty, acceptable under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock is rewound, strangers cooperate, Silas remains apart—an earned stasis with visible emotional cost. Causality holds under a Situational lens: the rumor’s arrival is coincidence, but Silas’s tactic of offering mechanical help, not mysticism, crystallizes community and isolates him further. Orientation is secured by word 60 (ivy-choked clock, splintered trolley). The only drag is a mild late-exposition patch—“the magic wasn’t in the object…”—which restates what the gesture already proved, shaving 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each touched object deposits a musical note, density rising until the final chord reweights grief. Causality holds—ring warms, notes layer, emptiness vibrates—so the final harmony is inevitable, not coincidental. Closure is a Charged Poise: the forest’s million frequencies resolve, grief retains shape yet becomes bearable, cost felt in the bone. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“silverleaf frond”) and spatial choreography stays clean; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each edit triggers a visible new disaster, tightening until commentary becomes the only open path. Closure—footnoting grief into the fold—pays off the time-crease rule with conceptual cost: he forever carries knowledge of the unaltered tragedy. One micro-turn (editor → annotator) lands cleanly. Minor waiver: orientation clear by ~100 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s silence is “entirely changed” into song, cost paid by Elian’s irrevocable expenditure of the night and the camera’s empty shutter. Accumulative lens holds: each mapped silence adds density until the final chord breaks pattern. Causality remains clean—no off-stage shortcuts—and orientation is anchored by word 60. One hairline slip: “fifty years” is externally supplied, not character-bound, keeping it from a pure 9.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because he burned the lie, he is exiled; because he is exiled, he can find her trail; because he finds the slash, he must finish her counter-vandalism. The tapestry-as-lens is set up in the first third and pays off in the final beat, satisfying closure with conceptual cost: he forfeits anonymity and accepts lifelong curatorship. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“Xylos Archive”). No lens ambiguity or telegraphing of twists; every object (mole, constellation map, easel) is因果 planted before it acts.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tap thickens the golden lagoon until the final image reweights loss into visible beauty. Closure is a Charged Poise—she stays perched, alone, dream alive yet unattainable; cost is the vacant space beside her. Causality is internal: because she drums, the room answers; because the room answers, her stance crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain is lucid: scrambled manifest → coin flip → cipher key → drawer hiss → silent victory. Closure earns a Cost-tinged Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen’s humiliation and the whispered legend re-weight social capital. Orientation arrives by line 4; no causal or prop missteps. The hinge is slender—one coin toss—but it forecloses brute-force noise, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: shutter-lines incrementally weave a welcoming pattern whose cadence shift (light-star descending) reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the lone persistent slit of light crystallizes guardian duty and reconfigures the canal’s darkness from dread to companionship. Causality stays internal but coherent; no external test challenges the tactic. Cost is present yet gentle (eternal watch), satisfying the 9+ quick test’s "persistent constraint" clause, though not heightened by sharper peril.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    A clear causal chain—prophecy → window plot → grotto amplification → chord shift—lands with conceptual cost: the town’s future is now an open, dangerous conversation. Orientation is anchored by line 10; the final image of the warming stone reweights stakes under a Charged Poise. Closure obeys the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: island ascends, Kaelen’s choice costs his tie to land/Elara; brine-scented image makes cost undeniable. Causal chain holds: scrimshawn call → root-snapping → island-lift, each step triggered by his poured-longing act. Orientation crystal by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Micro-turn at tide-exposed roots tightens stakes cleanly under Causal lens. One scaffold phrase “he was home” could be crisper, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: turbine thrum → staged narration → wood shavings tighten the same emotional frequency until the cadence pivots on the tiny bird in dead flowers—an Earned Stasis that reweights “hush” from forced to chosen. Causality is internal but legible: because grief is outlawed, therefore he stylizes routine; because Mara paid the price, therefore he dares only carve silence. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleport props. Cost is visible in the concluding tableau, though the beat could crystallize half a sentence sooner for 9-level punch.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single continuous scene, causal lens: because the ban lifts ∴ Kael enters; because he surrenders self ∴ he decodes the colonnade; because he decodes it ∴ he gains a blueprint and loses prior certainty. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the hum is not madness but “measure,” authority’s fear exposed. Cost is legible in bodily tremor and the blank frozen lake now re-weighted as “blank page.” Minor waver: orientation could be anchored 20–30 words sooner; still legible by ~130.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the single note reweights the world-rule that beauty must be imperfect; moonflower opening is visible, felt cost—Lyra’s voice provides the audible proof. Causal chain intact: plant cipher → concertina reed → glass vessel → breath → awakening. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“glassblower’s courtyard”) and held. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint: Elian’s ash-only palette persists, making the perfect sound transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of golden light vs. silence accumulates until the final reconfiguration when light replaces sound. Orientation is secured by word 60; no penalty. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the bell glows, Elian’s pilgrimage ends, and the cost is the irreversible shift from audible to visible harmony. The carbide-lens rule is taught early and paid off in the final image; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the projected twin constellations re-weight the tattoo stencil from grief-icon to shared cosmos, and the cost is the irreversible gifting of the last physical trace of Anya. Drive lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural—each origami adds density until the final cadence shift on the dais. Orientation (who/where/when) is nailed inside 60 words; no ambiguity at endpoint. Persistent constraint—the observatory’s “curtains of intention” only part for earnest hope—shapes every tactical fold and telescope walk; the final image is felt, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crypto crash is reweighted from personal tragedy to cyclical datum, with undeniable social cost encoded in the final line “next great and terrible thing we would build together.” Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore linked along the tape-as-timeline conceit. Orientation is anchored by sentence 5; no debt applied. Persistent constraint (father’s unfinished map) literally shapes the final image and charges tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the pagoda calms, her composite reflection makes the conceptual cost undeniable, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Causality is tight: because she avoids patterns, therefore the Aethel purify and inhabit her. The archive orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalty. No teleporting props or retro-patches. The ending image reweights the whole premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each descriptive layer adds密度 until the color-shift of the tail reframes the stake. Orientation anchors arrive early; the single transition from workbench to terrarium is seamless. Closure is a Charged Poise—mist thinning under steady starlight—reweighting compassion as resilient rather than naïve, with the cost of perpetual vulnerability left legible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (anesthesia hush, ivy pulse, coffee rings, hourglass weight) intensifies density until the protagonist’s stance crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the act of “pulling back” from the tunnel reweights the premise—archivist, not healer—at visible cost (“raw, vibrating agony”). Causality holds: because the miracle preserved the break, therefore he must carry it. Pattern taught early (returning geography) and paid off in final image of frosted glass.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the theater itself becomes the vessel, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds under an accumulative lens; each beat deposits love into the building’s fabric, and the final image crystallizes the pattern. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the valley’s static is re-valued from torment to hymn, and that reweighting is visible in the charcoal touching stone. Accumulative lens holds—each etched meteor tightens the pattern until the cadence breaks into silence-then-song; no causal cheats. Orientation is swift: basalt arch, aurora, fifth shower—all within 60 words. Persistent constraint survives: she will keep hearing every unspoken lament; the price shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crystalline pine reweights the rule-set—memory need not resurrect verbatim but can transmute into new being—paid for by the guard’s first susceptibility to dream. Causal linkage holds: archive tremor → conscious merger → wave-function overlap → arborescent crystal that still smells of resin; each step narrows options until the final image crystallizes meaning. Chess clock’s frozen midnight is persistent constraint, shapes skiff stasis, and returns in the last line to underline the end of the old game. Orientation taught by 60 words: lone guard, glowing dune, quantum archive; no ambiguity at closure; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the realization that he is drawn to sites of mechanical flux is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior jump. Causal lens holds—crystalline chime → insight → acceptance—without late rule patches. Cost is legible: endless, sleepless transit now embraced. Orientation is taught early by the copper-moss bed and wind-code, satisfying the disorientation waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the glowing star-stamp re-weights the premise—courage is not found but chosen—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-machine; each sensory breadcrumb (moonlit leaves, jasmine scent) accretes until the mist parts for her gaze, not her feet. The ticket’s blankness → star imprint is the visible cost, confirming readiness, not granting passage. Orientation anchors (twilight, stone, ridgeway) land by line 4; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: the rust-colored stain on step 19 triggers memory, the bolt is the physical tether, and leaving it re-weights both their futures. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the warmer air in his chest—yet the bolt’s decision could have arrived one beat earlier to tighten the final cadence. Orientation is firm within 120 words; spiral staircase geography is clean. One micro-turn suffices; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pellet dissolves into the rune, the false star gutters, and the throne’s legitimacy is quietly amputated—cost is the library’s erasure and Kael’s dissolution, both legible. Causal chain: centuries of marginalia → pellet → rune → severance holds without gaps. Orientation is complete by “ancient temple library suspended…” (~15 words). Single-scene default met; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal spine is immaculate: each failed rhythmic sequence → new data dive → refined pattern → final environmental trigger → missing beat discovered → successful summoning. The spiral-dot notation delivers a genuine Decisive Change that reconfigures both reality and Aris’s mission; the cost is the fleeting one-minute vision he can never hold longer. Orientation is secured inside 50 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps. Closure lands with conceptual repricing: the reef is not gone, only periodic, and his mooring becomes voluntary sentry duty.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the satellite’s double-blink is a Resonant Reconfiguration—silence becomes answer, defeat becomes relay. Causal chain intact: alignment → resonance → carrier wave → receiver crackle → satellite reply; each step shrinks the feasible world from “dead movement” to “one live tone.” Orientation anchored by word 80: “abandoned spaceport repair bay,” “last light,” “bare feet,” “ferrocrete.” Cost is conceptual: the rebellion’s heart is proved alive but still weaponless; her body is the antenna, vulnerable to any patrol that now knows the frequency. Minor slack: the “old seismic charts” origin of the note is told, not shown, but it does not break the final linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal linkage holds from kite → script → vent chemistry → unsealing; each step is tested on-page. Orientation is anchored by line 3: “edge of the geothermal pool, the sulfurous steam…” meets the 120-word window. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo absorbs the amber, reweighting the reconstruction’s sterile future with undeniable biological cost. Final image—“a single point of light in the churning water”—crystallizes options without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: drone-shadow pattern intensifies, then recedes, reweighting the stake from ambient threat to embodied endurance. Closure is a Charged Poise—watering can lifted, cost felt in the ache of joints—no path cleared, but stance crystallized. One shard only; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3. No causal missteps; ellipsis of the actual attack is legitimated by somatic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the shattered tarot box is re-ordered into a hand-drawn map, a Conceptual Repricing that makes the “luminescent ache” the new compass. Causal chain holds: because he cannot paint whole faces, he maps fragments instead; the lighthouse spiral physically guides the collage. Cost is felt—“fingers black with charcoal,” “mind quiet for the first time.” One bump: the time jump across hours of labor is compressed into a single paragraph, slightly blurring the moment of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s vanishing reweights the premise—he becomes the hunted trace, not the hunter, literalizing “disappearing ink.” Causal chain: eclipse → drone → rockslide → ink map → step-through; each beat is a therefore link. The ink mechanic is introduced and paid off within the scene, satisfying experimental legibility. Cost is legible in the final image: the empty rock patch where a man stood, the drone spinning over its own failure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: discovery → moral rupture → irreversible act. Orientation is anchored by line 3; closure lands with visible cost (“the world outside… unaware of the story about to be written violently upon it”). One minor causality bump: the pre-Unification terminal’s exact continued connectivity is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the dome’s quiet until the sheathing act ruptures and reweights the meaning of “quiet.” Closure is a Charged Poise—knife boxed, rose burning—cost felt in the foregone violent path. Orientation anchored by word 50; no ambiguity. One tightening suffices; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the strike that “defines the void” flips the story’s core rule (silence = absence) into silence = artifact with undeniable conceptual cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density mounts through crystalline sound-scapes until the single inverse tone reweights all prior noise. Orientation is swift—garden, night, fisher stakes by line 4; no debt applies. One earlier shard → return to path is legible; mosaic tests met.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds throughout: each question to Davies is a because/therefore demolition of premise. Closure—Celeste’s father now “among the stars”—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the orbit motif with earned cost. Orientation anchored by word 48; no spatial drift. One meaningful tightening: the phone call itself narrows options to public rebuttal. Minor slip: journalist’s whispered “His brother…” feels slightly convenient as first crack.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: *Papa* reconfigures the firmware and the psychic noise; cost is the now-silent terminal and the amber left as tombstone—loss made legible. Causal chain: letters → lab → firmware → constellation etching quiets the loop; each step tightens options under the Accumulative lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory grain adds density until the mandala reweights silence into shared focus. Closure is a Charged Poise—the flake at the center crystallizes options without verbal payoff—cost felt in irreversible shift from private witness to communal altar. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting objects. A single, meaningful tightening occurs when the flake is placed, foreclosing further speech acts.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mosaic stepping stone is introduced as both interface and price, its cracked pattern taught early and re-energized at the climax when the pale light fades into Ren’s blank calm. Causality is airtight: tessera → circuit → energy channel → identity melt → name minting, each beat contingent on the last. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sky remains shattered, Kaelen’s ledger of ghosts grows, and the cost is the irreversible thinning of his own humanity. The lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the applause-echo surges through Elara, re-pricing the tarot coin and the entire night; the pearlescent blossom is the visible, conceptual cost of Julian’s spent power. Causality is accumulative/textural—each echo layers density until the pattern snaps—so lens holds. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by line 5. One scaffold paraphrase (“a phantom in search of an audience” / “his very essence a low hum of rising nostalgia”) costs –0.1, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because he doubts but loves, therefore he designs the body-test; because the first image maps grief, therefore he risks a second; because the second maps love, therefore clasp. Each beat narrows his options until shared pulse forecloses solitary skepticism. Cost is legible in the final line—“their own perfect, irrefutable language”—where “irrefutable” itself is the price he pays.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stratum of color and tide-borne resonance thickens the silence until the alien waveform becomes a legible “first syllable.” The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara does not win or lose; she leaves as the first speaker of a language whose cost is the irreversible shift in her body’s “local gravitational constant.” Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by word 60: lone map-maker, post-human hibernation, cave mouth. No orientation debt. The only causal gap: how the act of floating physically records the waveform—yet the image is so conceptually charged that the leap reads as poetic rather than broken.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: he refuses to flip the hourglass and steps into dawn, the rolled chart and stoppered jar the visible price. Causal lens holds throughout—each button parsed literally unscrambles the prophecy syllable-by-syllable—so the final fork is inevitable in hindsight. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is lean and unbroken: Kestrel’s offer → coded snow message → coordinate reveal → Elias commits. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scuffed snow erases retreat, the pillbox becomes talisman, and the final stride reconfigures his world from hunted to hunter. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; mist and “tilt of the earth” teach ephemerality early. Cost is unmistakable: the map he destroys is literally the only copy, and his new war is now inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the promise is not broken but transvalued—its cost becomes the engine of compassion. The ferry bell’s single clear tone is the charged image that makes the shift legible and irreversible. Causal lens holds: because he cannot return, therefore he turns the ache into care; the needle joins blankets, not lovers. Cost is unmistakable in the “loosened knot” and the steady hands that must keep driving grief’s road.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each kindness-layer deepens the oasis’s density until the past bleeds through, a clean pattern taught by 25 % and paid off in the final chord. Orientation is swift: who, where, when anchored within 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—Kaelen stands in the hush after the thrum, the silence now re-weighted as “threads snagged on eternity,” a crystallized stance with felt conceptual cost. The only slack is causal slightness: the oasis’s magic never tightens options, only invites, so the ending is resonance rather than renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene constraint is respected; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 5. Causal lens holds: each night’s oscillation is a because/therefore test of persistence; the slit widening is the earned Decisive Change with felt cost (her arm, her sleep, her exposed hope). The final “heartbeat” image reweights the stake from intrusion to shared cadence—Resonant Reconfiguration. No off-stage shortcuts or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s new weight as “symbol of his singular now” reconfigures isolation into preservation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—images layer until the final cadence shift. Causality holds: hum → floor → surrender → new stance. Cost is felt: he accepts eternal stewardship of ghosts. Minor waiver: orientation anchors arrive ~130 words, but disorientation is functional at closure, so −0.2 not applied.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral’s placement reweights her archive of secrets into threads radiating outward, with conceptual cost legible in the image of being “part of one, a shared, public story.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of offerings charges meaning until the cadence shifts under the prismatic light. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is vivid by line 3; no ambiguity. The lens holds, cost is on the page, yet the beat count is thin for a 9+ ladder; one more causal micro-turn mid-scene would have sealed it.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: reverse-engineered counter-frequency → subsonic piggyback → observable de-escalation on the quad. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “fever” breaks in others, not via heroic speech but through her stolen carrier wave, and the cost—her continuing lonely vigil—is felt in the final sentence. The only drag is a brief explanatory lull (“Her weapon would not be a shout but a hum…”) that outlines the plan instead of letting us discover it in action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias fears enclosure he brings the compass; therefore the spatial mutiny escalates when sound activates it; therefore he transfixes the keystone to survive. The closure is a Decisive Change—new passage, new knowledge—paid for by the audible hush that replaces chaos. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the compass’s steel and his chest-pressure shape every tactical choice until the final hum locks reality. Closure cost is legible in the single sentence where “the oppressive weight on his chest vanished,” reconfiguring both architecture and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the scratch unifies killer/void and victim/light, reweighting Elias’s life rule (“I need absence to feel”). Causal lens holds: because he cannot read faces, therefore he paints structural void; because he lances the canvas, therefore empathy arrives as cost. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“the shadowed quarry exhaled…”), so no penalty. Persistent constraint—prosopagnosia—shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because he finds verse → decodes vortex → uses nail → unlocks true log → transmits, each step foreclosing the last. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the Guild’s century of erasure is publicly challenged, air itself “begins to dry”—a felt environmental shift. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“Far North Experimental Weather Station”). No teleporting props; nail and rock indentation planted and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because Lyra vanishes → therefore Elias rewrites reality-rule; glass flake is persistent constraint; scaffold-wrap code is taught early and paid off in the final note. Closure is Charged Poise: the first glitch-note hangs as undeniable conceptual cost—he has crossed into her ontology. No teleporting props; every object tracks. Orientation anchor (who/where) inside 120 words; waiver not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each creepy marker (“clown mask,” music-box waltz) tightens the workers’ unease and therefore stalls the project. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s final fold of the note reweights the entire inheritance theme, proving that hunger—whether armed or corporate—devours itself. Persistent constraint: the circus ghosts he weaponizes are finite, handmade, and leave him alone in the reclaimed quiet—cost felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the glyphs re-weight from puzzle to communal lament, cost paid in the physical tremor and the sunrise image that forecloses further decoding. Lyric causal chain holds—telegram → star chart → dream-witness → translation of sorrow—without teleport or amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 34 (“cold copper of the eyepiece”) and spatially tracked across dome, gears, desk. One smooth time-jump (night vigil → dawn) taught by color gradient. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (density of star pulses → ideogram sentence) is set up early and reconfigured at end.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: seed → ritual → breach → straighten → confession → plant. The branch’s unbending is the decisive physical change that releases the frozen confession, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (“she poured every ounce of her life force”). Orientation anchors within 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat is on-page, irreversible, and priced.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the straight thread reconfigures both dream-space and her tactical reality; cost is the consumed clipping and Kael’s deferred peril. Causal linkage holds—because she heeds Kael’s warning and sacrifices the clipping, the new vector forms. Lens stays situational-pressure; no teleporting rules or soft resets. One minor orientation waiver: “cobalt glade” anchor arrives ~140 words but disorientation serves the later permeability payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the burned Sun card planted as guard-stone reweights the bargain from despair to vigilance. Causal linkage holds—each beat grows from the prior (trade → void → root attack → memory offering → card re-purposed) and the cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drives under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the grille cloth’s return accretes density until the pattern breaks in the final image, reweighting meaning. Orientation anchors (quarry trailer, dawn, shoebox) land by word 80; no penalty. Closure = Charged Poise: the folded cloth on the desk reconfigures Elias’s options—no longer inventory, but evidence—cost is the irretrievable public failure now felt again. Causality intact: the wrestle → memory flood → placement; no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “distance” becomes measurable space between connected points rather than erasure. Causal linkage (because/therefore) holds: seed → waveform → filament → re-encoded Kael. Orientation anchor arrives by line 5; no drift. Cost is legible in the arbor’s hum climbing a semitone and the filament’s first pulse—physics, not sentiment, reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: ore→fish reweights the premise that identity must stay fixed; cost is the pain Kaelan accepts while holding contradictions in white-hot palms. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tidal lap increases density until lunar gravity crystallizes the final image. Orientation anchors (who=titan-gear, where=tidal atrium, when=perpetual post-tomorrow) taught by 40 words; no ambiguity. One meaningful tightening: waterline rise forces persona melt that narrows options to smelt or fail. Persistent constraint—moon phases govern selfhood—shapes every tactic and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change + Conceptual Repricing: the pearl-crystal fusion turns the bunker inside-out, broadcasting stored hope—before/after is legible and irreversible. Causal lens holds throughout: because he reads shell confessions → realizes pearl’s function → chooses reversal, each beat tightening options. Cost is on-page—“his oath…screamed at him to stop” vs. pearl’s warmth—delivered in final gesture. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (enter station → read graffiti → play one note → leave accordion) tightens options. The graffiti line is the decisive pivot that rewrites the map into self-agency; the single wheezing note is Charged Poise with cost—he abandons both father-music and brother-relic. No teleporting props or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the single radiant “Stay” reweights every prior delay-calculation, and the cost—loss of the library, of the possible lie, of safety—is legible in the thinning mist and the watch’s dying shudder; causality holds under Accumulative lens, each light-mote arrival a tangible because/therefore beat.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: plant vision → cracks imperial chart → therefore Elias propagates cutting and pens the heretical report, each step shrinking his future. Velvet observatory, coffee stain, and vine are kept physically present so closure image—the cutting in his palm—reconfigures destiny with felt cost. Time anchor (“before the Empress’s impending solstice address”) stays live, sharpening the urgency to act now. No causality breaks; the perforated destiny is literalized in the cracked porcelain lattice and paid for by exile.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared early and honored: static → aurora → pattern extraction → gem ignition → vaulting into lotus locket. Closure is a CR: the emerald’s private sun reweights oblivion itself—oblivion now costs a keepsake. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive within forty words; no orientation debt. Cost is visible in final image: “radiant hush…of a thousand last sparks” now excludes the one she just pocketed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the scallop physically rechannels water and symbolically rewrites the caretaker covenant—contentment is not found but enacted. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of organic detail intensifies until the final cadence shift reweights stakes. Cost is unmistakable in the last image—“faint trace of damp earth clinging to its tip”—where tool and caretaker alike bear the scar of interference. Orientation is anchored within first 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands: Kaelen’s decisive cloak-release reweights meaning—he literally sheds the mantle of certainty, cost felt in the dawn cold. Causal chain intact: shard provokes doubt → cloak removal externalizes it → wind-chime harmony signals re-tuned stance. Orientation crisp within 120 words; lighthouse, pre-dawn, North Atlantic wind all anchored. Lens: situational pressure crystallizes stance; no contradictions. Persistent constraint: narrator’s livelihood depends on perpetuating doubt—he pockets fee and shard, cycle ready to repeat—gives world a price.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reversed ripples reweight the rule-set—vanish first, appear second—charging Kael’s final stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout: because Elara withholds the explanation, Kael’s frustration intensifies; because he watches the backward rings, he gains the knowledge that reconfigures his desire. The withholding is itself a causal pivot, not decorative mystery. Cost is visible in the phrase “drowning in your own wake” and the final quiet potential that forecloses his old insistence on presence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer, echo, and bird pattern thickens the canyon’s drone until meaning reframes. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “They are safe” reweights the arrowhead from weapon to witness, releasing the wander-pulse; Kaelan’s own path outward suddenly feels possible, an undeniable cost to centuries of stillness. Orientation is taught early and paid off at the end, so no penalty applies. One minor slack: the flock-reading method is introduced only once; had it been foreshadowed earlier, the tightening would feel even more inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the keystone reweights the world-rule that magic must be programmatic, and the cost is the irreversible shedding of his technomancer toolkit. Causal lens holds: each diagnostic failure is a because/therefore trigger that strips away external crutches until only the empty-handed gesture remains. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no ambiguity at exit. Persistent constraint—the spire’s “accommodates impossibilities” trait—shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each lit lamp, descending lantern, and sinking book thickens the memorial mood until the dark library becomes the pressure chamber that forces the internal color vision. Closure is a Charged Poise—total darkness births indigo—as the final image reweights every prior light motif without exposition. Causality is emotional, not plot-based, and lands with conceptual cost: he surfaces “calm,” the world finally inhabited again. Pattern taught early (lantern/light) and paid off in blackout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each filtered burst adds density until the orchestra-tuning break reweights the stake. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the copper coin spent to buy a memory-library—whose cost is legible in the final “he just listened.” No causality breaks; orientation anchored in first 90 words; persistent constraint (burn-out risk) shapes the power-drain tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystal in palm reweights Kael’s purpose under Accumulative lens—dust drawn inward, light trapped, grief named. Causality is lyric but coherent; the atlas page seeds the naming stakes early and returns in the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: daily ritual → cadence shift → resonant chord. The 97-day ellipsis is a permissible compressive jump; the “click of understanding” is the single tightening that reweights the stake from futility to possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise: the humid darkening of dust beneath the arch is an undeniable conceptual repricing—water has answered song. Cost is visible in the instant of darkening; no new rule is introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: wind-chime silence → reservoir recession → label find → photograph trail → ledger correction → public exhibit. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the town ledger’s new marginalia shifts communal memory, undeniable social cost felt when descendants read the appended page. Orientation anchored by word 50 (Midnight Ridgeway, twilight, porch). Persistent constraint: the drought-exposed ruins keep choice binary—let libel stand or risk civic shame.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sublimated crystal becomes silver vapor that re-weights the orchard’s logic into poetry, with cost legible in the phrase “rigid scaffolding of his logic dissolved.” Causal chain holds—starlings → apple tree → crystal → locket → flame → vapor—each link tightening options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor waver: starlings’ arrow is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens rule.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: static-storm → silence → pattern anomaly → recalibration → silent warning, each beat a because/therefore linkage. Closure is Earned Stasis: Kael elects the quiet defense, foregoing public alarm; the cost is the hollow ache that “settles in his gut like a stone,” a felt weight that forecloses the path of disclosure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and again at the arbor re-establishment; no penalty. No因果 breaks; even the crystal’s fragility is pre-seeded by console description.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the newborn mind reweights Kael’s void and the dojo’s doctrine in one pulse. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat is a therefore stemming from the need to feel. Cost is legible in the drained breath and the monastery’s cracked composure. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is pristine: seed arrival → database ID → symbolic filter → Finch deduction → planting, each step a because/therefore that forecloses alternatives. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pot on the sunless shelf crystallizes both commitment and unknowable future, with undeniable conceptual cost (years, odor, reputation). No orientation debt; anchors (who/when/where) arrive by line 3. Lens (Causal) is declared in the opening beat and never wavers. Persistent constraint—the ten-year clock—shapes the final image and tactics. Cost is legible in the last sentence (“a testament to the fact that the most compelling mysteries are the ones you live alongside”).

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is lean and legible: silence → memory of yard-care love → three-pull start → hallway roar → recognition → fragile smile; each pull tightens options until the engine’s scream becomes the only speech left to him. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the smile is a lived-after change, the cost is the eternal engine-drone he must now keep feeding. Orientation is anchored by line 5 (“three seasons ago”) and spatially tracked from garage to hallway; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip from not dramatizing the son’s beat keeps it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene, causal lens: “because the cultist drops the pendant, therefore Lyel’s wait mutates into temptation; because he refuses violent certainty, therefore the rift collapses.” Orientation anchored by sensory cues within 60 words: skeletal roses, icy mist, makeshift den. One meaningful tightening—pendant burns, portal tears open—forces a binary leap-or-smother beat. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: portal sealed, pendant dulled, cost framed by “the ache in his chest remained” and the final “peace with the fog” crystallizing options foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds throughout: every failed experiment subtracts material and hope, therefore narrowing options until only the intact crozier curve remains. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when land inside 40 words—and the final dissolution delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the silver becomes “light itself,” a conceptual cost that reweights Elias’s entire premise. The “penny drops” beat is dramatized on-page, not narrated, fulfilling the closure-gate. A micro-loop of “he had… he had…” in paragraph 5 nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she discards three assumptions, therefore she carves the void. The orientation anchors—who, where, when—are cleanly delivered by word 82. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shard of hush arrives as a “coiled spring” that re-weights every prior failure. Cost is legible in the tower’s structural groan and the console’s dying lights, proving the new listening mode exacts a physical price.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vanishing is legible as a Causal rupture inside a single scene; each beat therefore tightens Finn’s options until he transmits the chord. Orientation is clean by line 7; no caps triggered. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hourglass restored but Finn stranded between timelines—cost is felt in the final image. One minor softness: the merge mechanism is inferred, not shown to fail or foreclose an alternative, so the Decisive Change is slightly under-registered.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the kitchen apparition crystallizes the new, cold consensus of connection and imprisons Elias in his own gallery—felt cost is the perpetual solitude inside the achieved texture. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weave thickens the lattice until reality renegotiates itself; no causal turns required. Orientation is taught early (gallery mirrors, warping floor) and pays off in the frozen black-glass surface at the end; thus no penalty. One micro-turn—memory cooling—propels the final escalation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: because the Visitors’ vectors reveal cosmic edges, therefore Kaelen re-weights the anchor as shackle and re-programs his geometry, therefore the council sees a star-chain future. Orientation is clean within 120 words; time/place锚 in “perpetual, pressurized twilight.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the hologram re-lights the anchor as first link of ascent; cost is the city’s entire self-definition, felt in chamber silence. One soft spot: the council vote is elided; we leap from stunned faces to “Kaelen knew,” slightly blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: hearing-aid pulse → locate Leo → translate rhythm → closure. Orientation locked by line 4; spatial choreography across the atrium is clean. Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pulse fades to hum, Leo’s breath syncs, cost is conceptual—grandmother’s peace transferred—rather than personal to Elias. The mild deduction: no persistent price boomerangs on Elias, so the “circuit” imagery stays metaphoric, not materially charged.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the gold fleck’s return collapses the ghost static, leaving “true, clean emptiness” whose felt cost is the irreversible loss of the lingering voices. Causal lens holds: phase-transition escape → console activation → spectral release, each step because/therefore linked; no orientation debt; the collapsing ceiling is foreshadowed by dripping seams, so the solution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the darkness-between-stars map reweights her own bureaucratic void into livable space, with felt cost (the ink collapse = connection lost). Causal lens holds: each ink-gesture is a because/therefore attempt to summon Aris; the chart’s appearance is the tightening that narrows her life-meaning. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by word 80; no penalty. One shard transition (ink pool → star chart) is taught early enough to be legible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of texture→sound builds density until spiral rupture reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—silence then single tone—undeniable conceptual cost: language reborn but audience still zero. Orientation anchors by line 3; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint: diamond’s fracture must align or fails; this shapes every prior attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: spy mission → grotto witness → rule reveal → stance flip → protective renunciation. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the arrowhead hums beside the phone, foreclosing exposé and charging new loyalty. One shard, no teleport props; orientation secured by word 80. Cost is felt in the “frostbitten hope” image—no explain-all, no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal chain holds: wind-gift shell → weeks of secret trials → tonight’s synched heartbeat → vine eruption → statues swallowed. The midpoint “method” discovery is summarized, not dramatized, creating a soft ellipsis that weakens full propulsion, but the final beat pays off the setup with visible cost—her collapse and the orchard’s irreversible bloom. Closure is a decisive change charged by absorbed machinery; no late convenience breaks logic. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is watertight: mapped absences → static bomb → upload → bluebird ping. Closure lands as a CR (“he had learned how to build it, one absence at a time”) with undeniable conceptual cost; the border rule-set is permanently repriced. One hairline slip: the arcade’s panel is introduced only at the moment it is used, a micro-convenience that prevents a perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the instant Elias sings, silence is repurposed into sacred listening; cost is the decade of voicelessness now spent in one exhalation. Causal lens holds throughout: wrong turn → oasis → discovery → restoration → song. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by word 40; no disorientation. Wind-gust coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Persistent constraint: the restored mare and her crown literalize the price of permanence—he can never again claim silence is absence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each book placement thickens the manifold until the scarf-window ruptures the library’s air. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vision dissolves, options re-weighted, cost felt in his tremor and the reek of ozone left behind. Persistent constraint—shift must wait for “next right time”—shapes the final image, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is pristine: each sunrise plate → palette well → incremental failure → fog-morning coup → final painting that literally reconstitutes the dream. The Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed inside 50 words. Closure carries unmistakable cost: the dream returns but only as an immaterial presence he can never possess again, crystallizing the stakes of a lifetime spent in predawn cold.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the rule-set that “a lock is a lock” is undone on the page when the ribbon unties itself and the hair becomes music. The cost is felt in the vanished lock—an irreversible loss of the last physical trace of the son. Causality is lyric-accumulative: starlight → lattice dissolution → chord release; the thinning air and ozone tang mark the tightening beat. Orientation is swift (salt circle, dome sky, twilight window) and serves the final image of ordinary starlight restored.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mushroom touch reweights the entire premise—observation is no longer enough—so the before/after is legible. Cost is on-page: “an ache that was both hollow and full” immediately after the memory bloom. Causal lens holds: thirty years of watching → anomaly → rule breach → key → new work; no retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (submersible, greenhouse dome, night); no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s kneeling to restack scrolls re-weights “home” from escape to co-rebuilding, paying visible cost in forfeited immediate departure. The Causal lens holds: because Kael maps loss as the key, therefore Elara chooses attachment to the broken place itself. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (“dust motes settle,” “empty playground swing”). The final image carries persistent constraint—the exile rule survives—but her stance reconfigures its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the escalating greyness → seed-infusion → color-return is a single, coherent intensification rather than causal chain; the final image reweights the world’s palette with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“verdant parapet… cliffside”), no drift. Closure is Charged Poise: the tender shoot’s inner light makes future stakes legible and forecloses retreat. One micro-turn—seed dark → seed galaxy—satisfies the tightening rule; no ellipsis or teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the net still holds thousands, the needle changes hands, the night is “just begun,” re-weighting silence from refuge to burden. Causal chain intact: sailor-knot → unravel → hush restored → apprentice burdened. Orientation locked by line 8; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in mentor’s exhaustion and Kaelen’s tremor—both on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear becomes a deliberate threshold, reweighting the entire premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean—each film comparison tightens pattern recognition until the lichen seam ruptures the known/unknown divide. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) are supplied within 50 words and never drift. Cost is felt in the final image: she forsakes restoration for disclosure, pen hovering over the margin—an irreversible archival transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mosaic design (surface vessel + submersible shard) teaches its pattern by word 150; transitions are legible; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images reweights the stake until the final Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands in the last two sentences: the narrator’s grief is reweighted by the snow-globe image, costing him his previous need to “untangle.” The cost is undeniable—his own grief is released—so the RR criterion is met.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is flawless: plate-slot → beam-graffiti → glyph-compression → lightning-thunder cutoff → golden reply. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tinkling melody reconfigures loneliness into shared recognition, and the warm bolt plate is a persistent constraint he will carry away. No orientation or lens ambiguity; every beat tightens the stakes of “will she answer?”

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: goggles → legible text → sketch re-frames Elara’s identity, forcing Kael’s silent vow. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “affectionate detachment” is charged poise where knowledge is now locked inside him, cost felt in the diary’s new weight. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by word 60; no ambiguity. Single-scene default respected; elevator transition is internal, not a shard break. Cost is visible—“he held the Captain’s memory… her secret joy now a part of his own silent knowledge”—foreclosing the option to share or confess.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise: the fractal cloud reveals Lena’s spiral, reconfiguring Elias’s theory into lived proof with undeniable conceptual cost—he now floats inside her, not toward Earth. Causal chain intact: because the string broke, therefore he seeks proof; because the noctilucent cloud mirrors her doodle, therefore memorial is complete. Accumulation of cloud categories tightens stakes progressively; no off-stage teleporting. Cost is visible in the final sentence: “endless, echoing beauty of what remained” = permanent exile accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “sky” she mirrors is not escape but containment, turning the demolition outside into a cosmic inside—cost is the condemned walls now cradle infinity. Causal chain holds: coin-scars → lock → stone → heartwood → sky, each because/therefore tightening until the final image re-weights space itself. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) fixed by line 3. The one hairline slip: the vellum note is a mild deus, but it is foreshadowed by the guild’s “ultimate ambition,” so lens remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lattice holds: hopscotch scuff → archaic cant → starling vector → luminance reveal, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the map is finished yet the pursuit is infinite, reconfiguring identity with undeniable conceptual cost (“cartographer of living light”). Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Minor waiver: the hopscotch-code epiphany is a touch convenient, but the birds’ prior patterning justifies the leap.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is a therefore/because chain—scrap prophecy → mirror chamber → eclipse key → gear-turn → golden dawn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors collapse to one true reflection and the distant morning finally “feels close,” cost paid by the swallowed light and the centuries of failed selves. No teleporting props; the gear pattern is seeded in the satchel early. Orientation is anchored by word 60. Exceeds 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: each chalk message → discovery → tactic change. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harmonic hum instantly flattens the magnetosphere and gifts a flight path—cost is conceptual (they leave the ghost behind) rather than embodied, keeping it shy of 9. No causality breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby re-stitches history and dissolves the crystal pane, costing Elias his last breath. Causality holds on the Accumulative/Textural track—each filament of light is a beat of density, not cause-and-effect reversal. Orientation is immediate; only the “pane of hush” physics is taught, never explained, and pays off in the white silence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: horn-call → caretaker duty → nut-beacon → birds repelled → path glows → traveler exits. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the nut is hollowed, frost locks the cliffs, Elias sits with the cost. Orientation lands by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: foam observation → polymer analogy → re-pricing of father–daughter bond. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing delivered in the light-touch final image of the cathedral nave; cost is the irrevocable acceptance of separate channels. No orientation or continuity stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the incision pours moonlight into the void, reconfiguring the entire library and Elian’s stance toward his wares; the cost is the irreversible scar in perfect clarity. Causal linkage holds throughout—each measurement beat tightens the vector toward the silent tree—so the lens stays causal without ambiguity. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“the shop was a quiet island…”) and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion dissolves, Kaelen’s contagious touch is neutralized, and the cost is the obliteration of his own emotional ridges. Causal chain holds—fossil → memory-map → dig → subsuming act → nullified grief—each step tightening options. Orientation is anchored by word 70 with wet stone and Warlord entrance; no disorientation serves the ending, so no penalty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and it lands with unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: because silos screech → Elias acts → weighted brass steadies the flow → harmony restored; each beat advances knowledge or option. Orientation is clean within 120 words (who/where/when). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he leans back, spent, communal peace achieved yet work never finished; cost is conceptual endurance. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: broken mirror → neural lace → self-remap → anchored dream. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: new internal chamber, visible cost in throbbing head and tear. Orientation solid by line 5; only micro-slip is “Great Simplification” label that never ripens into on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens: each beat is a because/therefore linkage—doodle glows therefore wall reveals, gravity shifts therefore scramble out. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (pre-dawn mist, damp stone, grotto mouth). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the combination is memorized, the vellum extinguished, the cost is the lifelong guardianship now internalized—“quiet, internal fire” makes the before/after legible. Persistent constraint established: knowledge can’t be unloaded, only carried at personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the grove now “listening” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—her silence has become communal resonance. Causal linkage holds: because she reads the Old One’s autobiography of cracks, therefore she strums, therefore the alders answer, therefore the silence is transmuted. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors arrive by line 3. One beat of mild convenience—every tree yields a perfect interval on first strike—does not breach causality at this lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the auroral checkmate reweights exile from punishment to privilege, cost etched in the dropped stone and the tear. Causal lens holds throughout—every luminous pulse is earned by Kaelan’s silence-charting labor. Time, place, and stake are anchored within first 120 words; no orientation debt. One minor elasticity: the instant leap from mental map to sky-show could use one intermediary beat to tighten causality, but the gap does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each frequency-tuning pass layers density until the pattern breaks with the clasp’s click; the closing image reweights both diary and fireworks under a new “perfect piece of quiet.” Orientation, causality, and cost are cleanly legible. The clasp’s audible snap plus the shelf-label “Unwavering Devotion” give undeniable conceptual cost; the lens holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the final wrapping-paper doodle reweights every prior scent-note into a crystallized new stance, cost paid in the “wildflower hush” that now frames her future. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of scent densities and doodled spirals tightens until the single still-image releases pressure. No teleporting props; the seed, wind, and paper are tracked without gaps. The only hairline nick: “the turning of the tide’s thought” is named late; the metaphoric rule-set could have been seeded one beat earlier to earn full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard harvest crystallizes new options for the dying orchard while time/physics exact an immediate price (planet reclaims gravity, river collapses). Causal lens holds throughout—each beat banks on because/therefore: arrow tip hum → follow river → crystal seared away → fall back. No teleporting props; orientation anchored by “ochre soil” inside 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the patch reweights the entire mystery from ground to sky, and the equation for "the end of a town" is now legible with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage is tight under Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard layers sensory grit and data until the inversion image crystallizes. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 40 words; no disorientation taught, so waiver not needed. Persistent constraint—the drone-gas ignition recipe—shapes every tactic and is borne by Kaelen alone at the end, satisfying cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each bell-stroke layers sensory texture that dissolves the sculpted hush, reweighting the world’s ambient silence into living stillness. The sculptor’s chisel cue at ~70 words anchors time and external trigger; orientation is clean. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—wonder is certified essential—felt in the rose-gold dawn hanging in the air. The cost is diffuse (perpetual custodianship? global exposure?) rather than a single concrete price, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    The inferred lens is Causal: every beat links because/therefore—failure → canyon ritual → spiral map → question-music → insight. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“Thunder-echo range”) and the driftwood action teaches the pattern early. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the flute’s silence reweights the entire guardianship premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—the flute now permanently reframed as “needle and thread”—shapes the final image and future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is pristine: borrowed personality → disorientation → transposition → physical reification. The halo fragment acts as taught rule early and exacts its toll at closure (photon-flare rewrites room geometry). Topaz walls and inter-constellation pocket anchor time/space by line 5; no orientation debt. Final image—Anya holding her grief-shape—delivers a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene causality: because the pendant vibrates, therefore time stretches, therefore Kael sees Elara and the garden, therefore he renounces courier anxiety. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crystalline plants remain, reconfiguring his stance with visible cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Aurora rule-change is cued early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost density increases, prism pattern repeats, cadence snaps at the schematic bolt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—love is replaced by shear-physics on the page, felt cost in the ringing void. Orientation crystal by 60 words; no teleports. Single-scene default met. The final image reweights every prior “truthful lie,” satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each golden thread woven → memory erased → options narrow to single final bead-locking act. Closure lands with visible cost—“she was peacefully, completely alone”—a decisive change that forecloses retrieval of love. Orientation anchored by word 70 (loom, orchard, bamboo); no teleporting props. The tapestry’s nova-flare vanish is taught early as magical loom price, paid off in final silent image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because the magician bled the arches, therefore Elian descends; because he offers memory, therefore the arch steadies. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the blue tracery reweights the premise: personal past can be coin to buy planetary future. Cost is legible: “flavors of his past now just empty words.” Orientation clean by 120 w. One micro-turn inside the cavern suffices. Minor scaffold in “slow but undeniable heartbeat” echoed next sentence; −0.1. Publish-now caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds throughout: shard gaze → layered visions → locating Elara’s universe → deliberate redirect. Each beat tightens options until the final dissipative push forecloses return. Closure lands with visible cost: the instantaneous silence of the bay and the collapse of all parallel views, a Charged Poise that reconfigures his occupation from hunter to archivist of finality. No causality breaks; even the off-stage physics is implied by consistent sensory rules.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: lamp fails → dread spikes → Silas braves squall → finds log → repairs beam → builds circle. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are nailed within 60 words; no disorientation. Closure is a textbook Earned Stasis: he cannot save the man but commits to the light, with the sea-glass held against the beam re-pricing their silent contract. Cost is visible in the ache of the final image; lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene, causal/accumulative hybrid: each glass-facet adjustment tightens the storm-pattern, a visible because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 60 words—no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the new dawn’s “strange resonance” reweights prior graffiti-glyphs into unintended prophecy, cost felt in his spent trembling. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the morpho-wing image reweights the premise—stories refract, not stick—charged by the chalk-map he can no longer complete. Causal chain intact: because he tracks light, he sees refraction, therefore abandons claim to ownership. Orientation anchored by word 70; no lens drift. Cost is legible in the abandoned chalk arcs and the unasked question he swallows. One hairline slip: the donor-heart backstory is told, not dramatized, but it primes the final insight without breaking linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is slender but intact: shard-fall → analysis → moon-healing → mosaic placement, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard’s acceptance reframes Aris’s lifelong quest as endless, now visibly priced by the mosaic’s expanding spiral. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; moonlight’s pattern-break reweights the stake without contradiction. Cost is present—the shard’s warmth replacing sorrow—but lightly felt; hence no 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: every beat layers sensory pollen/spore density toward the dawn vortex; causality is lyrical, still legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within first 90 words via mica window, perpetual night, greenhouse heartbeat. Closure—Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing: the newborn sun’s “tender warmth” reprices the realm’s rules and her mind; cost is the irreversible expenditure of the keeper’s sole intact memory, leaving her future uncertain. No gaps or loops; transitions are single-scene, continuous drift.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the invitation left unsigned becomes a tangible admission of error and a silent promise of future connection. Causal chain holds: refusal → regret → library vigil → perceptual dissolve → recognition → amended stance. One minor slack: the “staying while leaving” technique is introduced late and functions more as metaphor than rule; it doesn’t break causality but slightly blurs the lens. Cost is felt through the un-crumpled card and the relinquished safety of total solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal drive is manifest: because the city fades, Elara gardens; because she gardens, the guard confronts her; because she offers the bread, he relents—each step alters the option field. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the patrolman’s nod neither arrests nor blesses, but the courtyard’s new green spots now bear the cost of visibility, re-weighting all future seeds. Orientation is fixed within the first 120 words (who: Elara; where: colonnade tea-house; when: post-migrant-birds, cold deepening). No lens slippage—early decay images foreshadow the final “grey dust” of acceptance—and the thyme-in-fissure detail externally anchors the abstract absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the captured frequency equation becomes both “tombstone and seed,” re-weighting the entire enterprise under an Accumulating/Textural lens. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven—each artifact’s extinction tightens the density of loss until the final crystallized note. The Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is established by line 5 and never drifts. Cost is incontrovertible: the vow’s light dies, the city below is already “just strangers,” and the archive’s silence is now “more absolute than before.”

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: each failed tactic narrows options until the lie detonates the deal. Closure is a clean Decisive Change—fob discarded, Silas exiled, recorder warm—cost felt in Eva’s snarl and Elara’s shadow retreat. Orientation locked by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: Boro beat stalls rather than tightens, but it doesn’t touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance re-crystallizes as the aurora absorbs the carriers’ storms, cost legible in the clean taste of lavender replacing metallic/ozone signatures. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“lavender bluff…twilight”). Escalation is density-driven: each new carrier thickens the synesthetic palate until the aurora ruptures the pattern. Persistent constraint—the useless tin ring spinning “frantic”—survives the final image, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: failed forced lock → years of blockage → painting-as-diagram → color-sequence key → pigment gift; closure lands with conceptual cost (“paint the light by which he saw”) under a single lens, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The map’s assembly causally tightens options until the postal plate clicks into the vault, delivering a Conceptual Repricing that reframes honesty as literal seed-stock; the “before” (wilting fern, poisoned air) and “after” (clear air sprouting) are legible on the page. All props are planted early and retrieved without teleport; orientation is clean by 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each carved facet thickens the “density of wonder” until the final cadence shift liquefies the sculpture into mist. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3; closure is a Charged Poise where the cost—the iceberg’s vaporization—reverberates back through every prior image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal chain holds without ellipsis: magnetic shift → opportunity window → box opened → chaos feed → crucible burn → glass vaporized → exit. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the dome pane is gone, the garden is abandoned, and the android carries a new, irreversible organ-like jewel. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is nailed in the first 60 words; no disorientation served or needed. Every beat tightens options until only the jagged doorway remains.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: locket discovery → neighbor listening → pattern recognition → lock opened; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—Elias’s public gamble could have failed and now binds him to communal memory. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within first 80 words; no penalty. Lens stays causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each journal fragment and dance loop thickens the pattern until the dice-introduced randomness breaks it; the fractal bloom and re-tuned drone deliver Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost—her mother’s ghost is freed but the cage is now Elara’s to tend.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the recovered picnic fragment reweights the premise—memories are retrievable, hope is real, the path ahead is clearer. Causal lens holds: whale decay → gravity pockets → coffee-spiral map → lone attempt → partial success. Cost is legible in the sudden vacuum that “spins away” and leaves him gasping. Minor slip: orientation is slow (lantern clink before we know we’re on docks), but the delay serves the hush motif, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush is complete, the prophecy asleep, and the cost is felt in the emptied wing and her solitary vigil—an earned stasis. Causality is causal-lite but coherent: map silence → target gaps → flood with quiet; the lens holds. The piece teaches its elliptical pattern early and keeps it; orientation is clean by 60 words. A sharper micro-turn or persistent constraint would have nudged it into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the spiral impression in the planter reweights every prior lesson and exposes the “agreed upon lies” as the bridge it always was. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each sensory detail of groaning pipes and sun-bleached floorboards layers until the rooftop night sky reframes them as falling stories. Causality is clean: the borrowed-sugar invitation → weekly tea → seal gift → need for truth → rooftop interrogation → identity reveal; no beat resets or off-stage shortcuts. The final image carries undeniable conceptual cost: Clara accepts custodianship of an archive that will outlive her, a stasis that forecloses ordinary human connection.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is clean Charged Poise: surged memory lands with felt cost (“shuddered through his bones,” silent shell, tear) and reweights identity from curated peace to earned wholeness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of garden/tech imagery builds until final cadence shift. Orientation delivered by line 8; no drift. One meaningful tightening suffices; causal link between shell, spire, and memory extraction is legible and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the King’s grammar glyph exists, therefore Kaelen can perform calibrated treason. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within first 100 words. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the comma-tail rewrites 700 years of obligation in a single visible mark, cost felt in his tremor and the distant ghosts now “quieted.” Persistent constraint—the unbroken line left resting—shapes future peace without another drop of ink.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene causal chain: each sung key opens an echo-door that returns new knowledge, culminating in the final harmonic lock. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Closure lands as Decisive Change + Resonant Reconfiguration: the two halves fuse, Lyra’s identity shifts from “echo singer” to “finisher of songs,” and the cost is the tear that admits she will never hear her mother’s echo. Lens holds (Causal) without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a quiet but decisive RR: the boy’s smile and intact snowfall reprice the artifact from prison to memorial under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each dream-cameo builds density until the final shared dream crystallizes meaning. The melted globe’s state change on-page (still broken, no longer a prison) is the legible cost. No orientation drift; glacier shrine and dream-ocean anchors taught by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens governs: pattern density (nets, whisk, firefly blinks) tightens until the single whistle-beat reweights the stake—felt cost is the humiliation of unreciprocated sound. Orientation is crisp: parapet, city, meadow tracked cleanly; transitions are one descent/return within the single window. Closure is a Charged Poise: tools re-lit as “instruments” crystallize the new stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor drag: two reflective blocks edge the 20% ceiling yet remain anchored to present stimuli, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is immaculate: because Kaelen distrusts folklore, therefore reassembles papers, therefore discovers the stillpoint, therefore re-aims the diamond—each step foreclosing the last. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shimmering circle’s appearance/disappearance reweights every prior “curse” with physical law and the cost of demystification. The missing piece—what to look for—remains off-page until Kaelen intuits it; that ellipsis is motivated and paid off in the final image, so no causality break occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: storm’s fury → jolted chest → map → third-way broadcast → sky splits. One meaningful tightening at map reveal narrows options and forces public refusal. Closure (sunlight on broken world) is a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost: prophet bound to whimsy of hope/survival. No causal gaps; orientation locked by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the music box never plays its original tune, yet the loft now holds a full, transfigured silence whose cost is the poet’s solitary endurance. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each uncorking because/therefore thickens the air until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“feral loft beneath the dunes”) and held without drift. Persistent constraint: the box’s irretrievable past shapes every tactic; the price—irreversible outsiderhood—is felt in the closing stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: hostile frequency → therefore mirror → therefore subsumption. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the shuddering island goes still, Heart restored, Elara sweat-soak as visible cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (lighthouse gallery, polar twilight). No telegraphing of stakes—discordant hum arrives as immediate threat—keeps tension tight. The one-sentence price (“she slumped… trembling”) is thin but on-page and tied to the tactic that saved the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean CR: the viaduct lights dying re-prices the Authority’s certainty and Kaelen’s lifetime soundtrack of hum. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: moon-tracking density builds until the harmonic key snaps the network; no causal arrow is broken. Cost is legible in the sudden absence of sound she has never not heard. Pattern is taught early (moon paths, tidal schematics) and lands with the bowl ripple and the dead lights.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: drought-break flood → reveals tunnel → Finch entranced → fatal climb → Elias finds notebook → alters report. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words) and the single-scene default is honored. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Elias refuses the easy sign-off, choosing professional risk to honor Finch’s obsession. The cost is visible in the gesture of closing the notebook and the final sentence’s “fortified quiet,” but the beat could sharpen the personal price one half-grade more to reach 9.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Arthur relinquishes the mechanical heart and adopts a new pastoral stance—Earned Stasis with felt cost (he must now “look for cracks,” abandoning the old script). Causal chain holds: Thorne’s suicide → Arthur’s guilt → consultation → Elias’s reframing → Arthur’s renunciation. One minor slack: the shop’s spatial anchors (who/where/when) arrive after 120 words, but the delay is purposeful and waived because the final image re-uses the window/light motif.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each beat links “because arrow fragment glyphs → therefore re-engineered wing → therefore impossible hold.” Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: he is forever siloed above an acid sea, bell rung but unheard. The launch platform beat could shave 0.1 for micro-orientation lag, but the payoff waives it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens, rock-steady: every narrative increment is a because/therefore linkage anchored to the number trail. The “7” glitch → coordinate cipher → Seraphim71123 password → Void breach forms an unbroken logical escalator. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the instant the packet lunges outward, the archive’s entire moral ledger flips—deleted files are now revealed as buried bodies. Cost is palpable in the final tactile beat: the cool silver threads of the patch against her skin literalize the price of complicity and liberation at once.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s speech severs the village’s rush to blame, replacing it with shared mortal fragility—the cost is his irreversible transition from silent peacekeeper to exposed truth-bearer. Causal lens holds: because he seeks the shard → mirror yields vision → therefore he risks ostracism to speak. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“lighthouse orchard… frost-rimmed apple boughs”). No lens ambiguity; escalation tightens once—from accusation to empathetic exposure—sufficient for 700-word frame. Cost is on-page: “the weighted breath was finally released… a long, shuddering sigh,” communal and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ice sigh re-weights her premise—ending is not violence but release—felt in the same breath that dissolves her need to stay. Causality is accumulative: each salvaged object layers density until the environmental cadence itself provides the decisive turn. Parasol tip and ice sound form a charged poise bracket; no teleporting props, no outline drift. Cost is palpable: “Her work here was done” forecloses the volunteer alibi and the life behind it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural: the vineyard imagery and letter fragment accrue meaning until a Conceptual Repricing reweights the past. Closure lands with cost—the fragment re-seen as “dark lace,” foreclosing self-recrimination—visible in the final image. Orientation is clean by line 4; transitions are unnecessary. Causality is loose; the insight arrives by analogy rather than triggered event, but this fits the lyric/accumulative mode. No meaningful escalation beyond the single recalibration; pressure is static, not tightening, limiting band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the sphere seals the undistorted echo, reweighting the world’s noise vs. preserved truth. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of hush, sand, and light deepens until the cadence shift at the sphere pulse. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no debt. One扣: the parapet’s “psychic frequency” rule is late-introduced, a micro-break that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mosaic shard structure is taught early—“dozens of black-and-white photographs” as geography of heart—and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each seasonal layer thickens pattern until the spiral completes. Orientation is secured inside 80 words with lavender, factory ruins, dove-gray case, and Elias kneeling; no penalty. Closure is a clean CR: the final image (girl releasing paper boat) re-weights every prior arc into “a wide, bright expanse of recovery,” undeniable conceptual cost paid by Elias’s anonymity and the town’s unconscious healing. The because/therefore linkage is lyric rather than causal, but under Accumulative rules the cadence shift from soot-smudged tear to crescent smile is decisive and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of sonic fragments builds density until the crystal reweights Elias’s life-work. Closure is a Charged Poise—he cupping the crystal, vowing unwritten testimony—cost is the forfeiture of print certainty. Causality holds: each listening session “because” the last, tightening his stance. No orientation debt; library anchors drop by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because he forgets, therefore he pre-lays driftwood; because the sigil is gone, therefore he surrenders to the tide of sound. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (junkyard, coast, fog garden). The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the imperfect circle reconfigures the quest from capture to participation, with chalk dust as persistent constraint. Cost is legible in the final image—circle already blurring, silence returned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: spinning hand → lunar harmonics → lens sacrifice → frozen zenith. Orientation is swift: cupola, failing clock, moon visible by line 5. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hand points forever at a single instant, cost legible in “beautiful, silent prison.” No lens ambiguity; one micro turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: bent-spoon reality → broken lexicon → re-learning inversion → topological key push → shadow-turn reveal. Each beat narrows her toolkit and raises epistemic cost; the final image literally projects the cost on the wall. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s grammar is now inside-out and she must write in it. No orientation debt; ‘star-dusted velvet’ situates time/space by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory brush of hedge leaf and trowel scrape thickens pattern density until the tooth’s pearlescent glint ruptures the texture, reweighting stakes from communal grief to intimate ontological fracture. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elias dips quill, positions the impossible molar as first star, making the new constellation’s social/self cost undeniable. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no teleporting props; reflective blocks ≤20% and always cue present trowel or ache. One soft spot: causality never explains why Elara hid the box precisely here, but the emotional logic (garden = her heart) is internally sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sea-glass “pearl of stillness” reweights the entire premise—light can be shared without fire—with undeniable social cost (she must now descend the grotto and confront a world addicted to roar). Causal chain holds: memory of fire → polish → absorption → self-sustaining glow; each because/therefore linkage is on-page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Felt cost is legible in the final image: she holds “a star she could share,” foreclosing her own anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens: because she has tended the garden and decoded the drip-pattern, therefore she can offer him a living alternative to fossilization. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“old server farm”). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pendant’s meaning flips from stasis to choice, cost felt in her relinquishment and his first non-shattering breath. Minor slack: “confession went viral” is told not shown, but it is back-story that does not distort present causality.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: burying the shell reweights Elias’s professional rule-set, making “fertile ground” of the blank page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cameo adds density until the pattern breaks in the glowing release—cost is felt when the current’s pressure eases and the desk reappears. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Elias stood…”). No causal timeline is broken; the seed image at the end is an undeniable pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: because he sings the forgotten song the vine grows and the past is re-shown; because the dawn arrives the light show ends and memory is re-implanted. One clear Decisive Change—ritual succeeds, village heart is re-set—is on the page with felt atmospheric cost (quiet now “pregnant”). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 80 words; no ambiguity. Closure lands under causal logic, no retro-patching. The cost is conceptual rather than personal, but the story keeps its promise.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the map ignites, the child sees, Kaelen re-kneels—options re-weighted, cost (his surrendered stillness) legible in the final image. Causal chain holds: heartbeat → pattern → starlight infusion → seal → ignition → child’s vision. Orientation lands by word 80; no lens ambiguity. The flash-paper burn is simultaneously Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each charted reflection angle adds density until the lattice logic clicks, the final hum reconfigures the cavern’s meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—the quartz flash makes the conceptual cost (perishability of wonder, labour of preservation) legible without exposition. Causality stays internal: because Elian deciphers the angles, therefore the timer re-awakens; no external antagonist or coincidence required. The price is the season-long solitude already spent, felt in the “weight of the wounded season,” so the resonance lands with felt, not declared, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Accumulative CR: the tear-stone drops into the mosaic, reweighting the entire grotto’s silence and the reader’s sense of the task’s scale. Causality is intact—every step follows because the last one did, and the price (another irreplaceable stone, another splinter of self) is legible in the final image. Drive lens is taught early and never contradicted. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the first carved line crystallizes the lesson of stillness, reweighting her future. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal; pressure intensifies through sensory density (rain, kettle, scent) rather than branching options. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no disorientation persists. The cost is conceptual—she surrenders the intact blank, now forever altered—visible in the final image of “newly scarred block.” Meets 9+ quick test except the constraint could be sharper; minor hairline slip keeps it at 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Causal: every beat is a because/therefore chain anchored to the camera wheel discovery → memory bleed → confession → integration. Orientation is taught by word 40 (“the Precipice Platform”) and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the carousel halt is irreversible and Kael’s identity is permanently re-priced from engineer to archivist of ruin. The final line crystallizes the Earned Stasis: he is still, and this stillness is the cost. No lens ambiguity, no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: find shard → decode as grid key → scavenge carnival cables → slot shard → throw breaker → sky lights. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the galaxy projection reframes the terminal from “place of departure” to “monument to destination,” reweighting her entire premise. Persistent constraint—the diesel generators’ throaty hum—lingers under the final image, confirming price. One soft spot: the schematic-crossing beat is summarized, not shown, slightly blurring the because/therefore pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single-scene arc framed in contiguous pre-dawn minutes; orientation (who/where/when) secured inside 120 words. Causal track: carrying the dream → exposing it to light → relinquishing concealment; each step narrows retreat. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bells blaze but stay silent, re-weighting silence from tomb to foundation; cost is the irreversible public exposure of private failure. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early via “glacial hush” and honored to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore—radio silence → dawn → end of window → salvage completed. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s “inherent truth without sun” reweights the family lie from betrayal to sacrifice, cost felt in the vast yet serene upheaval. No teleport of props or knowledge; grandfather’s journal was the logical payload of a lockbox hidden where flawed plans were dumped. Orientation anchored by word 30; no ambiguity at closure.</question>
    <question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal is not scenery but a force: thick water resists pole and hook, imposes slowness, dictates tactical patience. The corroded lockbox’s drag-through-silt is tactile, lived-in; the crumbling abutment supplies the only purchase point for grappling. Radio static and silver dawn line are time-and-place cues integrated into action. Final image of “thoughtfully clear” dawn light recharges the water’s earlier bruise-color, now morally recalibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the rope’s map is transposed into journal lines, reweighting the premise—knowledge now survives the artifact’s physical loss. Causal linkage holds: because he deciphers the knot, therefore he archives it, paying the price of fragmentation. Fog’s retreat crystallizes the new configuration on the page. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by density-cadence shift and holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the thread reweights healing from erasure to container, felt cost in “magnificent, heartbreaking design.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (smokeless horizon, rust chrysanthemums, scarlet thread) tightens the cadence until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors clear by line 40. Persistent constraint: island sealed until spring, isolating the act of writing with irreversible solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the mechanical world literally pauses, re-weighting the premise that only organic beauty can redeem rust. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard, hiss of steam, and cracked shell adds density until the cadence of gears falters. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“cold filigree of the observation deck”) and the pattern is taught early. Cost is unmistakable: the bird’s song is “bitterly sweet,” Kaelen’s body wasted, his dream permanently altered.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain holds: father’s threat → conservatory burns → banyan wound → graft → coin severed → new bond. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the red thread once tied to paternal guilt is now tied to life, reconfiguring her inheritance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are in by line 4 and hold. Persistent constraint—daughter-of-arsonist identity—shapes every tactical decision and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causality chain is immaculate: tapestry→star chart→box pane→discolored marble→oculus timing→millimeter rotation→click→water whisper. Each discovery is a because/therefore step that narrows options; the goose pause is both timer and mirror, forcing the final alignment. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the city’s collective relief is the cost she absorbs by forfeiting empirical proof. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; every breadcrumb of light is paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the instant Xylar flips sonar from map-making to gift-giving, the premise reweights—light becomes transmission, not resource. Causal lens holds: every beat is because/therefore linkage of sensing → discovering gear → rejecting calculation → emitting empathy, each step narrowing options. Cost is palpable in the release of the ancestor’s metal logic and the open-ended expenditure of self that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each night’s retracing layers density until the storm-panel ruptures into the web-image; closure is a Charged Poise where the slate’s unnamed lacework reconfigures Elias’s vocation. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The single causal micro-turn is the storm-night breakthrough—enough at this length. Cost is felt in the unsold, unnameable stone left among “living, growing things.”

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the story teaches its pattern early—clock-tending pause → memory shard → inscription → imagined release—then deepens the density each cycle until the final beat reweights the clock’s cadence as an audible absolution. The broken rake handle’s micro-introduction at the first gear-house mention, its mid-scene carving labor, and its closing imagined drop give a clean CR: the town’s spiritual chronometer is re-tuned. Cost is legible in the “subtle smoothing” Elias hears and the physical lightness that follows letting-go. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (oilcloth, gear housing, belfry gloom) arrive by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frayed thread adds density until the celestial map “snaps into focus,” a clean cadence shift that reweights the stake from mystery to reunion. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shelf enshrines both path and postponed future—whose conceptual cost (the lovers’ death) is legible in the final image. The mild orientation debt (time-of-night inferred not stated) is taught early and pays off, so no penalty applies. Causality is intact: the case’s pulse is the only overt coincidence and it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single causal thread: because models predict doom, therefore Kaelen authors a map; each paragraph tightens options until the nib’s descent is the only delta left. The blank vellum is both literal page and conceptual fork; choosing to write severs the path of stasis. Closure lands under Causal lens with conceptual cost—once ink marks, ancestral life-ways are overwritten. Pattern is linear but taught early and pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lattice holds: because silence was decreed, therefore songs must hide inside scores; because Elias alone can transcribe, therefore he bears the price. Orientation is anchored within the first 80 words—who, where, when, and the famine’s context—without stall. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the score becomes a double artifact, music to the censors and scripture to the dust; the image of motes learning the words re-weights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. One micro-turn—tipping the page to awaken the ink—condenses the stakes and forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s final stillness reweights the entire ritual, making the “mirage of safety” conceptually undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each object (mask, urn, chair) accretes meaning until the dust-cloud in sunlight crystallizes the cost. Causality is tight: because Elara withholds the artist’s suicide, Kael can complete the scattering; therefore the stillness delivers an illusion that will later collapse. The 120-word orientation anchor is met inside 90 words, and no lens ambiguity persists at close.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a pristine Conceptual Repricing: the decision to remain “its memory” reweights the entire premise—truth-telling is futile, archiving is the only victory. Causality is tight: every beat (finding→cleaning→confronting→boxing) links by therefore, with the girl’s mythic reading as the irreversible pivot. Cost is unmistakable: “cosmically useless” is felt, not told, and the velvet box becomes an urn for a living world. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural: sedimentary layers tighten the stakes without causal reversals, ending in charged stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tension tightens through atmospheric density (autumn decay, failed hymn) rather than causal reversals. The turning beat—rosette as pedagogical pivot—lands on-page with Conceptual Repricing: the carved silence redefines harmony itself. Orientation is stable (velvet library, choir hall) by ~120 words. Cost is unmistakable: communal hatred is momentarily hollowed out, foreclosing the old additive method.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each tasted memory → specific pruning → new flavor, a clean because/therefore chain. The alignment clock creates tight temporal stakes; the final fruit is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—he must now distribute a history he has edited. One minor scaffold loop (“he tasted… Snip.”) repeats three times; not fatal but dulls the closure image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Silas cannot lie, therefore he must plant a riddle; because the city sterilized wonder, therefore the drones starved. One graceful shard—Lena arrives, leaves—keeps chronology intact. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lacquer box stays shut, reweighting the city’s rule-set at the cost of continued blackout. Cost is legible in the humming dark that frames his final nod; the reader feels the price of wonder preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: pattern of tiny anchor-drops tightens stakes by increasing visibility risk and refining her theory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “she wasn’t waking the houses at all” reweights every swap under a social-cost frame—she’s now a question-peddler, exposed to residents’ gaze—felt in the new lightness/flamingo beat. No plot amnesia; props remain tracked; orientation anchored in first 40 words. Persistent constraint: once the orris shard is left, she can’t undo the trace.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens: each because/therefore linkage tightens options—lie revealed → gill recognized → poison refused → ampoule buried. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: she becomes traitor to her own people; city’s lung survives. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by word 50: “Mara’s gaze drifted… underwater city garden.” No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the staircase rule-set is rewritten—texture of regret now a reachable, priced resource—and the cost is legible in the “fresh wound” and eternal labor ahead. Causal lattice holds throughout: chipped die → flawed equation → seven → rupture → regret tasted → canvas reopened. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor tightening at the roll is enough for 800-word scope; escalation coherent under Causal lens. Persistent constraint (infinite stairs) shapes next loop, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the skyline’s scattered answering lights reweight Elias’s premise—kindness is not extinct—at undeniable social cost (he is now exposed, no longer anonymous). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each canvas adds density until the pattern breaks outward into the city. Orientation is secure by 70 words; no cap triggered. Cost is felt in the final image (“his breath catching,” “frantic counterpoint”). Lens holds; one hairline slip—brief summary of “six nights” instead of dramatized beats—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: frozen silence → lens reveals fracture → memory of resonance → bread cue → communal song → thaw. Orientation anchors by line 4; no drift. Closure is a decisive physical change (ice cracks, water returns) charged by the anthem’s cultural cost—memory made kinetic. The “rosewater dread” abstraction is the only minor causal hiccup, but it doesn’t break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: low-tide vacuum → yoyo key → lever pull → un-making. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the lighthouse, Elias, and temporal stakes are anchored. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “unwritten past” reweights every prior clock. Cost is visible—his lifeline scars fade, implying erasure of self-history—meeting the 9+ test, but a hairline slip: the final “roaring fire” metaphor is slightly stock, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: each annotation propels a because/therefore move (“lowest point holds highest prize” → slide → clasp). Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the void, once confessed, flips from liability to blade that dissolves Fear; cost is the permanent alienation implied by clutching the now-heavy clasp while advisor falls silent. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (mirror shard, carousel pedestal) track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the storm is not defeated but metabolized into music, cost felt in the prophet’s exhausted stance and the orchard’s groaning memory. Causal lattice is immaculate—every mallet strike is a because/therefore response to an incoming wave, tightening options until the sea literally hums his tune. Orientation is secured within 40 words via “blue hour,” “leeward tide prophet,” and “orchard afloat.” No lens ambiguity; fractal-drawing rule is taught early and paid off when the final low hum “recharges” the earlier charcoal etching.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the map projection reweights every prior assumption with undeniable extinction cost. Causal lens holds—because he sounds the pattern, therefore the watchers reply, therefore the city’s path is revealed as sealed doom. Orientation anchored by word 30, no drift. One hairline slip: “the world held its breath” edges toward omniscient padding, but it is brief and does not touch the decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens: because/therefore chain (petal → task begun, parallels → Elara’s surrender) holds to closure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Ashworth precedent reframes her duty, felt cost in her millstone shift. Orientation locked by 80 words; no teleport of props. Ivy image recurs as coherent constraint, softening earlier metaphor without break. Persistent constraint: Thorne must now carry public revelation—price acknowledged in final clause.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the inkwell’s retrieval reweights Elias’s solitary stewardship from quiet routine to fierce covenant; “he could not lose the vessel of these memories” is the exact sentence where cost crystallizes. Causal linkage is tight: bridge rising → isolation → pavilion access → fissure opportunity → drop → retrieval → sealing, each beat therefore narrowing future nights to this ritual. Orientation is anchored within 30 words and the drawbridge’s severing motion teaches the isolation rule immediately. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the final image of inkwell-as-dark-star reconfigures meaning without exposition; the price—bloody knuckles, lungs burning—is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a pristine Charged Poise: the blackout’s reclaimed stillness becomes the earned stasis of complicit silence, the coral stamp’s weight the visible price. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each sensory drip, moss-glow, and salt-sealed drawer tightens the same stake—truth vs. systemic erasure—until the final image reindexes the entire archive. Causality is lyric but causally intact: because the stamp matches the ghost-mark, therefore Elias chooses complicit correction, not heroic exposure. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by sentence two.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure delivers a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica dream flips grief from drowning sea to navigable current—conceptual cost indelible (“a part of him now”). Causal linkage holds: gem polishing ascends while memory plunges, each frictioned facet a because/therefore step toward the climactic projection. No orientation drift; setting anchors inside 120 words via floating tea garden. Persistent constraint: the cranes will never fly, a lifelong price shaping future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: missile → loss → perturbation hunt → reservoir found. The breaker-reset clock creates a tight because/therefore race; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—coordinates reweight her grief into a targeting vector. One minor causality slip: coolant stabilizes yet array cache still “threatens to vanish,” a timing fudge that nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the lens-beam strikes the chip, symbols flood the screen, and the frequency of belonging becomes undeniable; the uplift re-prices her solitude with conceptual cost. Causal chain: pilgrim → chip → star-trail navigation → hidden lens → revelation, each step tightening options. No orientation debt; spatial logic is immaculate. The final image crystallizes stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine holds: refusal of false past → disappearance → discovery of total erasure → vow to reverse it. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the realization that silence itself is a weapon and that he must weaponize his own talent to fight it. The driftwood shard’s void is the concrete, felt cost that reweights the premise on the page. Only quibble: the “two weeks later” gap is an ellipsis that could have been dramatized in a single beat to tighten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (moon cue → flagstone → lion key → lock turn) is a because/therefore chain that narrows to the decisive click. Orientation is anchored by 50 words; no teleporting props. Closure is a Charged Poise: the chains drop, but the lingering warmth on the brass reweights the mistake-cycle theme with concrete cost. One soft spot: Kaelen’s consent is silent, so the final trust leap is slightly one-sided, preventing a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass held over dark water, the sea accepted as future judge. Causal chain intact—poles as penance → compass as verdict → shoreline as first breach in that penance. Utility-pole grid seeded early; final image reverses its certainty. Cost is felt: he has stepped off the gravel “crutch” with no guarantee, only the unreadable needle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the letter re-weights the baseball and the lake into a lived imperative to forge rather than find identity; the cost is the visible relinquishing of amnesiac peace. Causal chain holds: classified digits → coordinates → descent → letter → spark; no teleporting props or retro-patching. Lens is Causal throughout; the final beat crystallizes a forward path under the same lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bond is “reforged” into a new cosmic intimacy, paid for by irreversible bodily cost—his arms now “covered in iridescent plumage.” Causal linkage holds: fortune cookie → ritual → transformation → shared moonlight existence. Mosaic structure is taught early (silver orchard, moon, spice ritual) and stays coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)
    A clear Accumulative/Textural lens: star-dusted clouds and the cracked saucer accumulate emotional density until the linen re-tracing reweights meaning. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (cloak dropped, hand re-drawn), satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor causal slack: the leap from “smudged fist” to midnight pilgrimage is asserted, not shown, but the pattern coheres by the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative lens is declared early and held: each photograph = one density unit, one knot, one lift toward the aperture. Closure—silver knots igniting into a dimensional doorway—offers clear conceptual repricing: the species’ sorrow becomes the key, not the lock. Causality is lyric rather than linear, acceptable under Accumulative/Textural rules. The tear’s rule set never shifts, and every beat adds weight/buoyancy data that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of light/fire images tightens until the green steam plume reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by word 30; the detour (finding the spiral shell) triggers the only causal pivot, then pattern intensifies via repetition of glow, hush, heartbeat. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s new steady pulse = visible cost for Kael’s “gift.” No lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens dominates: each angle-click tightens options and triggers the light-network, producing a decisive change of control before the old guard notices. Orientation anchored by ~100 words; no disorientation serves closure. Closure unit is a CR: the fort’s light-pattern reweights authority with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint—Kael’s lone access to the sundial—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: vision → spiral circuit → star-dust keystone → null-zone split. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the aurora tool becomes “his own,” reweighting earlier borrowedness with felt cost. One soft spot: the spiral’s circuit logic is revealed only at climax; earlier planting would lock causality earlier. Still, the split-wave image is an undeniable physical Decisive Change with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine holds: timetable hiding-place → timed vigil → key/negative → telescope lock → departure. The timer’s ping supplies the Decisive Change with audible cost; the negative’s silhouette and the key re-weight the past and future in one image. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no lens ambiguity. Closure is clean, no off-stage assists.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sundial’s click and revealed parchment crystallize a before/after with conceptual cost—his rival’s abstract riddle has been forced into material form. Causality is causal-thematic: each needle-reflection angle dictates a blade placement, so the fencing literally “answers” Elara’s encoded prompt. The half-painted dial and gnomon shadow act as persistent constraints that shape every tactical lunge; cost is felt in the final image—he now possesses a map whose dangers are implied. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the four strangers begin sorting under starlight, reconfiguring the ruin from private sanctuary to nascent community; the cost is the irrevocable exposure of Silas’s haven. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each salvaged book and folded poem adds density until the final image reweights the stake from solitary penance to collective rebuilding. Causality is intact: because Silas offers the poem, the young woman steps inside; therefore the library’s meaning flips. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the moon, rusted girders, and marble floor anchor time and place.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal linkage holds: flickering compasses → discovery of reel map → sonic brute-force → doorway. The clock’s frozen hands act as a visual promise that time can restart, giving the ending its Decisive Change. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. Cost is felt—he forfeits the arbor and the piano—though the beat where he commits to that loss is compressed into a glance rather than a full beat of hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: seed pressed to earth + rain starting reconfigures meaning of memory, belief, and doubt with undeniable felt cost. Accumulative/lyric lens holds—dream layering and cadence shift tighten stakes rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“ancient ridge”), pattern taught early, no penalty. No lens ambiguity; pattern pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear: decipher lace → wait for wind-against-tide → compass steadies → grief diffuses. Orientation is immediate (islet, post-squall, cottage, bluff) and the single transition uphill is clean. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass points downward, grief becomes “part of the vast melancholic blue,” and the path of apology is foreclosed with the felt cost of forever losing Elara’s voice. The lens holds as causal with one meaningful tightening; no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Aris reweights “drama” from noise to essential truth, with visible cost in lost detachment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via repeated observation through butterfly dust until the orchid-to-weed transfer crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“stood where the door... used to be”), and the single scene tightens coherently around one stake: understanding chaos. Final act (seeking the shovel) shows decisive re-engagement with process.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen’s kiln relit not as return but transformation, fusing fire’s terror and frost’s wisdom. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring motifs (glass, fire, frost, ledger) until the final image reweights them. Cost is legible: she accepts the fire’s violence as part of her art’s language. Orientation anchors immediately (“canyon under stars”), and causality flows through sensory observation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara reconfigures silence from absence to creative space, visualized in pearlescent white on winterglass. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via thermal color layering until the capsize memory intrudes, then deepens through synthesis. Cost is legible in “deep exhaustion” and the irreversible transformation of trauma into art. Orientation is immediate (“winterglass conservatory,” “bare feet”), and the single scene tightens cleanly around one stake.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias achieves silence not by escape but by fulfilling a mythic function, with palpable cost in lifelong weariness finally released. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and spiritual static until the lens insertion triggers resolution. Orientation is immediate (“The package had arrived…”), and the single shard structure fits scope perfectly. Cost is legible in the final image: “his own weariness settling into a gentle, welcome calm.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s public vow at the arbor reconfigures silence from fear to communal purpose, with felt cost in exposure and trust. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—donations build pattern, bell breaks it, garden reweights meaning—and the terra-cotta arbor setting constrains the final act. Cost is legible in the elder’s hands returning to soil after decades. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“Elara, leader… forgotten exile community”), and causality remains tight without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with breath cycles intensifying density until the fog resolves into shimmering motes—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire premise. Orientation is immediate and vivid (“twilight viaduct,” “camera obscura artist”), and the closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: love isn’t stored but transformed. The kwan yin’s tear hums precisely when needed, and the breath method escalates pressure without coincidence. Every beat tightens toward the final image, which crystallizes before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, escalating via density increase: memories dissolve progressively until the climax releases them all at once. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights the entire premise by showing that experiencing time’s “texture” annihilates the self. Cost is legible in the last lines: Elias has no name, no past, only green hedges and paths “waiting to be walked for the very first time.” Orientation is clear by line 3; lens holds coherently through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s stillness amid mechanical chaos crystallizes her renunciation of freedom for legacy, with undeniable conceptual cost (permanent bondage) legible in the final image. The Causal lens holds—each beat links because/therefore (arrow triggers key sequence, which activates defenses, delaying enforcers). Orientation anchors instantly (“chain…tethering her to…prize redemption center”), and the Divider Wall’s fall tightens stakes coherently.

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dust, stillness, fragility) that culminate in the Charged Poise of the stilled chair—a Resonant Reconfiguration where peace is legible as illusion. Orientation is immediate: “central chamber,” “curator of endings,” “new client” anchor who/where/when by line 3. Cost is unmistakable in Elara’s “heavy, knowing stone” heart and Kael’s temporary, fragile reprieve. Every beat tightens toward the vanishing point, with no causal breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Silas reaffirms his role as archivist despite futility, foreclosing outreach with quiet resolve. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through layered sediment, object reverence, and competing narratives—and holds coherently. Cost is legible in the final image: the cog placed among relics while the girl flees, underscoring irrevocable cultural rupture. Orientation anchors (“sewer system,” “plague ended a generation ago”) are clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unified hum crystallizes a reconfigured possibility, with cost legible in the “fragile,” “wavering” quality of the sound and the erasure of identity (“not sopranos and tenors… just a resonance”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through sensory layering and pattern (noise → subtraction → breath → hum), culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Orientation is immediate (“velvet library,” “autumn,” “Elias”), and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly. The rosette’s reappearance isn’t a retrofit but a taught motif that pays off causally.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plant’s transformation reweights cultural memory with visible cost—the excised traumas are tasted, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned disruptions building toward a Conceptual Repricing: Elara’s work isn’t about sanctifying structures but seeding human awareness. Closure lands decisively when the flamingo and flowers manifest as behavioral ripples, proving her method’s efficacy. Cost is legible in her isolation and the risk of trespass, crystallized in the white cube’s stoop. The drive lens holds coherently from opening image (“streetlights daydreamed”) to final “hushed blaze.”

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara buries the ampoule, foreclosing destruction with tangible cost. The drive lens is Causal—each revelation (“not conquerors,” “gill not weakness”) narrows options until refusal becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the ice thaws, sound returns, and dread lifts—all achieved through on-page action. The causal chain is tight: observation → historical recall → proposal → communal action → physical result. Cost is legible in the ever-present threat of crushing ice and the near-extinction of culture. Orientation is immediate (“grotto city,” “frozen waterfall”), and the Causal lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias doesn’t reach a new future but dissolves into “the shimmering, terrifying potential of an unwritten past,” reweighting all prior stakes. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via sensory layering (ozone, slick rocks, violet pulse) until the final cadence shift (“roaring fire in the sudden, silent void”) crystallizes cost. Low tide anchors time early and tightens pressure to a single irreversible act. Every beat flows from Elias’s causal rebellion, culminating in a Charged Poise that forecloses linear existence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the void redefined from weakness to anchor, with visible cost (permanent alienation, loss of reflection). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—luminance, mirrors, and notes layer until the final dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard survives not by evasion but by harmonic integration, with Kai’s body and tools bearing the cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory layering (salt/apple blossoms, creaking wood, rain cadence) until the squall’s chaos is reweighted into concerto. Orientation is immediate (“blue hour,” “driftwood island,” “Kai, the leeward tide prophet”) and serves closure: the setting’s fragility makes the stakes visceral. Cost is legible in Kai’s heavy breath and the timbers humming with memory.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through recurring patterns—light, sound, turtle movement—until the final projection delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the watchers are not oracles but lighthouses. Cost is unmistakable in the image of the Maw of Silence and Kaelen’s shattered certainty. Orientation is immediate (“city of Atollon drifted… shells of gargantuan turtles”), and the closure lands with devastating clarity. The hairline fracture in the whistle mirrors the fracture in Kaelen’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Aris’s argument (“because the Ashworth lie collapsed, therefore ours will”) directly causes Elara’s reversal. Orientation is immediate—Blackwood Terminus, two characters, post-petal-drop timing—and closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ‘V’ shifts from sacred relic to structural flaw, with legible social cost.

The drive lens is Causal, held consistently, with each “because” narrowing options until the final stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and ritual cadence until the bond “snaps into place” as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via Charged Poise). Orientation is immediate: “Elian stood among the silver-leafed trees” anchors who, where, and the moonlit when by line 1. The closure image—hands now plumage, consciousness woven into the orchard—carries undeniable conceptual cost: he is no longer human, yet at peace. Every beat intensifies toward this reconfiguration without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Lost time... was simply vapor” reframes the entire quest, transforming repentance from recovery to release. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory density (ozone, moss, ink) and patterned objects until the linen-and-saucer motifs crystallize into a new stance. Cost is legible in the discarded cloak and the abandoned smudged ritual. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (midnight glade above clouds) pays off in the closure’s celestial poise.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael bends prophecy rather than breaks it, reconfiguring his relationship to fate with visible cost (physical collapse, eel distress, expended star dust). The Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic (vision → spiral → aurora trigger → harness). Orientation is immediate (“Kael’s magnetic boots…”), and the tide’s violation of frictionless physics is cued early, making the climax legible. Cost is undeniable in “slumped to his knees” and “for now.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lightning flashes, ticking timer, and brittle periodicals layer pressure until the *ping* shatters Elias’s mask. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—he sees the key, the timetable as map, the undeveloped negative as future work—and chooses journey over stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white doorway offers possibility, not certainty, with Elian stepping into undefined shoreline—options reconfigured, cost felt (abandoning his post, leaving the clock behind). The inferred lens is Causal: because compasses fail, therefore he uses the film; because he decodes its glitches, therefore reality distorts; because he plays the final arpeggio, therefore the threshold opens. Cost is legible in the last glance at the clock—a promise implying future consequence—and the first star marking time’s irreversible passage. Orientation anchors instantly: “Elian, the station's last pianist… tidal arbor above the clouds.”

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
