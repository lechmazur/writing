  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's evolved understanding, with visible cost in her transformed perspective from cosmic to microscopic scales. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as dust patterns gradually reshape both greenhouse and scientist. The closure lands with "We are all dust, rearranged, learning, decaying, and still growing," though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to artistic renewal. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elya integrates the smuggler's methods into her art, though the cost remains primarily retrospective (the fire) rather than arising from present choices. The frost patterns create coherent linkage but the transformation feels somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes music, with visible cost in Mara's scars and trauma. However, the accumulative structure lacks sufficient density increase in the middle third, and the cost feels more declared ("each vibration smoothing a jagged memory") than dramatized through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands—the library transforms from tomb to sanctuary through accumulated light imagery. Cost appears in "the weight of centuries pressing against his chest" and Marlow's final dissolution. However, the transformation lacks a clear before/after state since we never see the library's initial condition, and Marlow's vanishing feels symbolic rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the bell ritual and anonymous donations pattern, building toward an Earned Stasis closure where the community endures through solidarity. However, the cost remains abstract ("amplified quiet would never become a void") rather than concretely felt, and the piece relies on summary ("success of the first month") rather than dramatized accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres as breathing patterns and visual layers accumulate toward releasing unused love. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the reservoir transforms into "a river of sparks" touching passersby, with felt cost in Milo's continual pilgrimage. However, the conceptual leap from tear to reservoir strains credibility mid-piece, and some transitions feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through the maze's transformation, but closure lacks decisive change or clear cost. The ending image of "endless discovery" provides atmospheric resolution without visible price paid or path foreclosed. The maze completes itself through abstract processes rather than character agency driving the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's transformation from "chained liberator" to "first gardener of a new era," with visible cost in the ruins and her rusted chains. The causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from piano puzzle to vault to planting, though the metaphorical "wall coming down" feels somewhat disconnected from the main throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.9)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where memory becomes "a forge" that transforms absence into resonance, with conceptual cost implied through "broken trust and new hope." However, the accumulative structure lacks clear escalation—Mara's actions repeat (setting up forge, recording, placing device) without meaningful deepening or pattern break that would reweight stakes. The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira transforms from thief to guardian of illuminated moments, with the cost being her former identity and freedom (she becomes bound to the station). The accumulative structure builds through moonbeam imagery toward this crystallization. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Mara's glass-crafting building toward a Conceptual Repricing where the abandoned control room transforms from "cold command" to "cradle for hopeful inquiry." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—while thematically resonant, there's no visible price paid or option foreclosed through dramatized action, only philosophical reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Mara accepts that "my greatest stunt was simply surviving my own terror." The accumulative structure builds through library exploration → shell discovery → cipher decoding → amber transformation, each layer deepening her relationship with fear. However, the magical elements (amber vial, leviathan fragment) introduce late rules that strain causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration as the map dissolves into "marbled hush itself," but cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated phrases and imagery, yet the ending lacks a decisive change or visible price - the oracle stands "unshaken" without transformation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the robot's discovery building through resonance and amalgamation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where janitorial work becomes transcendent. However, the cost remains abstract—"each fleck might hide a lingering thought" doesn't show what the robot sacrifices or risks by pursuing consciousness, and the closure lacks the visible price needed for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the town's collective transformation, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres around the transparency theme, yet the actual mechanism of change (lens projecting confessions) strains credibility without earned setup. No specific, visible price is paid by any character.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through marble polishing that culminates in garden recognition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden crowns its keeper, though cost remains primarily metaphorical ("weight of both bloom and rot"). The piece teaches its symbolic system early but the transformation from "mended deception" to "shining pathways" lacks a concrete price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with cost—Lira successfully proves her hypothesis without sacrifice, trade-off, or meaningful change. The experiment succeeds, flora blooms, birds rise, but no path is foreclosed and no price is paid, reducing this to a demonstration rather than a story with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara's playing releases the ghost's trapped melody, transforming the flooded space from haunted to peaceful. The accumulative lens holds as water patterns, program marginalia, and musical notes converge meaningfully. Cost is felt in the ghost's release and Mara's promise to return, though the resolution feels slightly too neat with the rain stopping and river receding.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Mirela's gradual process of reading atmospheric data through smudged ink leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where internal weight transforms to external resolve. The closure lands with "auroral sorrow faded into a quiet resolve" showing cost, though the precise nature of the "swallowed lie" remains vague, weakening causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a clear drive lens—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density coheres into meaningful escalation. The closure attempt ("he chose to leave the wheel where it lay") provides no decisive change or reconfiguration with visible cost; Mara simply walks away unchanged. The orientation remains murky past 120 words (who is Mara beyond labels? what mill? when?), and the "swallowed truth" about buried chemicals arrives as late exposition without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around regenerative silence, but closure lacks visible cost. The keeper enters the refuge, experiences dissolution, writes a line, and returns unchanged—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The orientation is clear but the ending offers resonance without reconfiguration or decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the eclipse event creating a resonant reconfiguration through collective wonder, but the cost remains abstract rather than visible on the page. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~50 words. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing where ordinary magic becomes a generational practice, though the specific price Liora pays for this transformation isn't dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the historian's discovery that the displaced axis is "not a fracture but a realignment," with the silo breathing as "living pulse" at closure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (tapestry, diaries, glyphs, vibrations) toward this reconfiguration. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"the last sigh of humanity's collective dream"—though the final image of gathered stories makes it felt. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing through the lighthouse becoming "a beacon of open mysteries," but the cost remains abstract. The story accumulates metaphorical layers without establishing clear stakes or a before/after shift. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately, but the conceptual weight never crystallizes into felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward closure, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The "possession" timeframe creates urgency without clear stakes or consequences. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration but the "calm resolve" resolution lacks visible price—I cannot point to a specific sentence where cost becomes legible.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lian achieves her conductor role through accumulated imagery (nautilus spiral, mirrored horizon, glass resonance). Cost is visible in the transformation of the frozen lake into "vibrating chords." The accumulative lens holds throughout with density increases toward the symphonic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing ending where accepting fractured timelines grants peace, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The accumulative/textural lens builds through layered imagery ("darkening brightness," "periodically eternal"), yet the procedural generation mechanism appears late without clear causal linkage to the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marin transforms from numbness to feeling. The closure lands with visible cost ("frost under a sunrise, each droplet of feeling a tiny drumbeat") and the pattern of mirrored hush/reversed songs coheres. However, the transformation happens without sufficient resistance or complication—the needle simply works as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward Elara's decision to bypass the quarantine. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she simply places the tube in a shaft "hoping" it will deliver truth. The stakes remain abstract ("fragile hope," "truth will find a way") without concrete consequence or sacrifice that would constitute a true Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Arlen transforms grief into "a lantern of understanding," but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The accumulative structure works but lacks a decisive tightening—the vapor's revelation doesn't force a choice or foreclose an option. The orientation is clear early (greenhouse, Arlen, extinct plants).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens applies: the piece builds density through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where binding the rope crystallizes the poet's stance. Cost appears in "sealing the echo of the escaped soul" though it remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (grotto, poet, energy beings) establish by ~100 words, and the pattern-weaving accumulates toward closure, but the cost lacks the concrete weight needed for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the violinist playing music that transforms the "chronic hush." The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as silence becomes "a space waiting to be filled," but the cost remains abstract—we see atmospheric change without personal sacrifice. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and causality holds, but the transformation lacks the concrete price that would elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Mara's final state crystallizes her role as emotional intermediary with the "perfect balance of insight and empathy." However, no visible cost lands on page; she simply continues her trade cycle. The courier's arrival suggests continuation rather than transformation, and the "half truths of the city aligning with her own" lacks the decisive weight needed for strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a genuine closure unit with visible cost—Mara's actions (placing the locket, creating the Compassion Register) are gestures without stakes or sacrifice. Causality is loose: the misdelivered envelope leads to discovery but no decisive change occurs; the boy's story resolves through explanation rather than dramatized pressure. The accumulative lens suggested by the library scenes never coheres into meaningful density increase or pattern break at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's collective weaving and the tag's transformation, but the cost remains abstract - "luminescent ache" and "fragile, beautiful duty" lack concrete stakes. The accumulative structure coheres but relies on assertion ("binding all who listened") rather than dramatized consequence. Who/where/when anchors establish adequately early.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira releases the pendant and becomes "the echo," with the city's rhythm restored. However, the cost remains abstract - we're told about transformation but don't feel what Mira sacrifices. The accumulative structure coheres but the final image lacks the sharp price that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation of loss into growth ("grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth"). However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt - the conjurer experiences no visible sacrifice or struggle. The accumulative lens holds but the closure lacks dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Maren transforms from hidden crawler to visible guide, with the library's "sigh of relief" marking the shift. The accumulative/textural lens coheres through repeated "sapphire hush" and sensory accumulation, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the linden leaf's transformation as its closure unit, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration through the leaf turning green. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual (patience, releasing control) without visceral stakes—Marlowe risks nothing tangible, and the transformation would occur with or without his intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara exchanges her paintings for the convergence's renewal - a clear before/after with visible cost (surrendering her art). The accumulative structure coheres well through water imagery, though the mystical mechanics of the brooch-as-key strain credibility slightly. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost. The ending gestures toward transformation ("discover that unseen forces...can magnify the magic") but remains abstract without a before/after change legible on the page. The repetitive circular structure ("The next day, a child...") dilutes rather than deepens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with fragments building toward communal chorus, and the Resonant Reconfiguration lands when isolated exile transforms into collective memory-making. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we see the archivist's satisfaction but not what he sacrifices or risks. The orientation anchors clearly (harbor, archivist, post-exile purpose), and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist discovers the fortress is "not a place of stone, but a living archive" and commits to becoming its conduit. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—she faces no meaningful obstacles, loses nothing tangible, and the "trembling certainty" never manifests as genuine doubt or price. The accumulative lens works through layered discovery, but the closure lacks the visible sacrifice or foreclosed option that would make the transformation resonate beyond intellectual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the magic square tile's transformations, building to Earned Stasis where Lira creates the sanctuary. Cost is visible in her transformation from skeptic to keeper of memories. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off through the tile's final placement in the carved alcove.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the immortal discovers goodbye is "not a final cut but a transition, a magnetic pivot in spacetime," with the cost of abandoning his crystalline sanctuary. The accumulative build through magnetic fields, spatial mutiny, and prismatic echoes coheres at the ending. Slight opacity in the middle corridor sequence prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where bureaucratic rigidity dissolves through the ink's mathematical proof, with clear before/after states. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see the transformation's effect but not what Mara sacrifices or risks, and the resolution arrives too smoothly without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where "invented histories were not lies but bridges" reweights the opening's silence, with the stationer walking "deeper into the bonsai corridors." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—the "weight of collected textures" lacks specific price beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator accepting their role as "unnamed keeper," with clear cost of remaining forever marginal. The accumulative lens holds as fragments layer into meaning. The orientation anchors (port, containers, narrator's dead status) establish by ~100 words. Deduct -0.2 for slight ambiguity in how the label mechanism works.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Selene reframes myths from things to debunk to melodies that persist through retelling, with the seashell as "ephemeral compass" providing coherent accumulative pressure. The cost—accepting uncertainty over fixed answers—is conceptually present but could be more viscerally felt. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of chip → decoding map → organizing graffiti network → community reorganization → postponed privatization. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community's unified response crystallizes new options, with visible cost in the "tireless work" and ongoing vigilance required. The orientation anchors (raft city, river, Mira) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the inspector photographing the sand grain as dawn breaks, achieving closure through Conceptual Repricing—the grain transforms from relic to "captured breath of time." Cost appears in "tremor of grief" knowing colonies will reclaim the mineral, though this emotional price arrives suddenly without prior buildup. The chemical timing mechanism creates a ticking clock that adds modest pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory layering building toward Mara's completion of the repair. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she returns to her bench for the next iteration—but the cost remains mostly conceptual ("broken things and new horizons"). The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by ~100 words, and the repair sequence creates a complete arc, though without a decisive change that alters Mara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where ice yields to water, maps transform from static to living documents, and Mara shifts from observer to recorder of genesis. The condensation pattern leading to "Kaltwasser" creates meaningful accumulation. Cost is felt in "terrifying and hopeful" and the ice's irreversible cracking. Minor orientation wobble with "after the falcon returns" creating temporal ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical cause-and-effect (tuning fork vibrations rebuild town), but the closure lacks visible cost—the tuner simply walks away after success. The transformation from ruins to revival happens through magical resonance rather than earned causality. While the piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara releases the perfume, transforming from seeker to sharer. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "giving up the distress signal sender's own hope" but never feel what this sacrifice means to her survival. The accumulative build through repeated "gathered hush" and "crystal perfume vial" creates pattern but the final image lacks the visceral cost needed for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with copperlight imagery and the hush motif building toward discovery, but the closure lacks decisive cost—the boy finds the map, guides others, and achieves peace without sacrificing anything tangible. The revelation of bodies and transformation to "beacon of truth" occurs through declaration rather than dramatized change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the bride's dissolution and the orchard's permanent transformation, with visible cost (her erasure). The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks. However, the transformation lacks intermediate causality—the mechanics of how her breath fertilizes soil or why this specific moment completes the debt remain opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth transforms from ruin to reverence, but the cost remains abstract ("quiet perfume of orchids," "humbled guildmasters"). The accumulative pattern builds through repetitive imagery yet lacks a decisive moment where the weaver pays a concrete price. The closure lands conceptually but without visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the altar's completion allows ancestors to speak, fulfilling Mara's mission. However, the accumulative structure lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully justify the textural lens. The cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the ritual of encoding meaning into physical mail, reaching a Resonant Reconfiguration when "the letter began to vibrate, its edges shimmering with the very meaning she had sought." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt - we see transformation but no sacrifice or price paid for this achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building toward sending the chart, but closure lacks visible cost beyond the ember becoming ash. The conspiracy's exposure happens off-page through a courier, deflating the stakes established throughout. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost - the protagonist simply walks away after a magical resolution. The "apology" dissolves without consequence or recipient. Who/where/when anchoring is vague (a cryptic medium in a mangrove), and the stakes never materialize beyond abstract "unsent letters."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through coral metaphor and translation acts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared anxieties transform into "quiet strength." However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt—the "lotus-hearted ache" is asserted but not dramatized through specific loss or foreclosed options. The orientation anchors (translator, atrium, twilight) arrive clearly by ~40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure with visible cost—the artist simply completes her mural and walks away satisfied. The transformation happens without meaningful resistance or price paid. Who/where/when anchors are present but the "centuries of thick fog" setting creates temporal ambiguity that never pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building toward Lena's stance shift. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through her choice of curiosity over certainty, with cost visible in "the old certainty drift away." However, the accumulation relies heavily on abstract imagery ("cascade of miniature auroras," "nested awakenings") that dilutes causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based communication and converging chaos, but the closure lacks visible cost—Dr. Mirabel simply decides to protect the garden without sacrifice or trade-off. The concept of "thoughts becoming taxable" is intriguing but never tested through concrete action or choice. The final image of the greenhouse as "living archive" offers resonance but no decisive change or reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the poet's verses building toward a mystical transformation when the postcard's nebulae "burst into full bloom." However, the closure lacks visible cost—the poet simply succeeds in his mission without sacrifice or trade-off. The orientation is clear (shell, poet, mission) but the resolution reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned change, with no "before/after legible with a felt or conceptual cost."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual repetition toward the traveler's arrival as resonant reconfiguration—the preserved names finally finding a recipient. The "who, where, when" anchors establish clearly (glass-orchid caretaker, opal library above clouds, nightly ritual). Cost is visible in the caretaker's persistent "foxglove regret" and the traveler inheriting "the weight of each name." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the symphony metaphor and glyphs unwinding. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the archive breathes alive and keepers emerge, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the council elder's acceptance and the city's shift to "conversation" over "conquest," with felt cost in his doubts trembling "into silence." The accumulative lens holds as stone breathing, water flow, and encrypted compassion layer toward harmony, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered imagery (dust spirals, pigeon routes, meteorite fragments). The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lila learns "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new," but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatically enacted—we see the result of trust rebuilt but not the specific moments of risk that earned it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (the child transforms from lost to "keeper of quiet rituals"), the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative pattern builds but the closure lacks a specific, visible price for this transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain deliberately vague past 120 words without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through firefly multiplication and holographic constellations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aria gains belonging "etched into her heart." However, the cost remains abstract—we see no concrete sacrifice or foreclosed option, only that "the feeling of belonging remained," weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when Maren realizes paths await "the right emotional resonance." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt—she solves the puzzle without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed options. The bridge's restoration feels mechanically complete rather than earned through genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive change or clear reconfiguration with cost—the performer simply continues his act and disappears. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clear but the closure unit ("vanished into the shadows") provides no legible before/after or felt cost despite the attempt at Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira gathering the moonstone speck and inscribing the verse, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where her exile becomes "a chosen pilgrimage." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we're told about transformation but don't experience what she sacrifices or risks in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern and imagery building toward a meditative conclusion, but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Mira begins seeking meaning in the mundane and ends having found it, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid, no options altered—the final image of stepping away "ready to read between the ordinary lines of tomorrow" suggests stasis without the earned refusal or endurance that would constitute valid closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to establish clear stakes or cost. The "bargain of innocence" concept never crystallizes into concrete terms—what was traded, what debt exists, what consequences loom. The closure (light cascade creating understanding) arrives without visible price or genuine reconfiguration, reading as unearned magical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from individual gauge investigation to communal transformation, with the altitude gauge serving as central metaphor throughout. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as equations become visible pathways of hope with clear communal cost/investment. Orientation anchors effectively establish the grotto setting and Arin's role early. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how equations directly "revitalize" physical pathways.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through discovery of film technique, wall dreams, and final communal transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the legacy transforms from individual burden to "shared communion," with cost visible in the weight Lira carries. The piece teaches its pattern of echo-as-memory early and pays off with the walls sharing dreams, though the final extension past natural closure dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when mirrors reveal doors and children chase possibilities. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no clear sacrifice or foreclosed path. The pattern teaches itself through repetition but the transformation lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with ritual elements building toward reconciliation, but the closure lacks visible cost—swords are laid down without dramatized sacrifice or loss. The transformation from war to peace occurs through Lira's reading of terms rather than earned causality. Who/where/when anchored adequately early.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the egg's release creating a permanent echo in the salt flat—a "fragment of grace forged from cruelty." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and the salt flat's resonance build toward this crystallized moment where preservation and destruction merge with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the harvest of echoes becoming a city-wide awakening. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when individual voices replace conformity's lullaby, with cost visible in the courtesan's vanishing ("leaving behind a world forever changed"). However, the orientation remains vague—we never learn the specific city, time period, or concrete nature of conformity's oppression.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure lands on the page—Selene simply leaves the dome with unchanged intentions to continue her puppet shows. The accumulative lens attempts to build toward revelation through the campfire stick's glow, but the "half-lit epiphany" about puppet strings as lifelines creates no before/after change or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's temporary monuments, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. No concrete sacrifice or foreclosed path appears - she simply builds structures that will dissolve at sunrise without personal stakes. The accumulative texture builds effectively but lacks the decisive pressure that would make the closure land with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through the rope's reconfiguration releasing names, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sanctum transforms into a "living library." Cost is visible in Mara's commitment to return each solstice and the traveler's discovery of Eira establishing ongoing stakes. The closure lands cleanly though the middle section could tighten the causal link between rope manipulation and name recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the forest's "decaying directive" rewriting itself and paths choosing new walkers, with clear cost in surrendering human control to the forest's will. The accumulative structure coheres as spores, seal, and storm converge into the vortex that lifts consciousness "beyond the bunker." However, the middle section's dream interpretation feels mechanically inserted rather than organically emerging from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing mystical density toward the covenant's sealing. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tile activates and prosperity flows to the city. Yet the cost remains abstract—"empirically ironic" calculations don't translate to felt consequence on the page, and the transformation happens without meaningful resistance or price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure with the music box's pattern creating resonant reconfiguration as monks release resentment. The "shifting grace" framework coheres well with the sanctuary's transformative power. Cost is visible in the released grudges and the wanderer's sword-to-peace transformation, though the cellular memory mechanism borders on convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through synchronized breathing, fog transformation, and the dream's capture, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where boundaries dissolve. The closure lands with the orchard's renewal and Arlen's guardianship role, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see transformation but not what Arlen sacrifices to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change with visible cost—the quartz mending succeeds without meaningful obstacle or sacrifice, making the closure feel predetermined. Causality breaks when "forgotten bag contents" conveniently contain exactly what's needed without setup. The lens reads as Accumulative but fails to build sufficient density or pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where linear narrative gives way to networked inheritance, with the curator accepting memory loops and temporal paradox. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward the final realization that "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the middle section's bathroom revelations feel episodic rather than tightly linked.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the library's purpose is "finally realized" through Selene's discovery, with visible cost in the form of knowledge that must be taught to alter timelines. The hybrid lens holds consistently, though the time traveler's role feels somewhat disconnected from the main causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from ship to garden through verse-gathering, with the emerald swatch card's transformation into "a compass of names" providing resonant reconfiguration. The cost appears in "unkindled solace now finally kindled by purpose," though this conceptual repricing could be more viscerally felt. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where absence becomes bridge, with cost implied through the clock's stopped time. However, the transformation feels too smooth—Mara steps through the dissolved door without genuine risk or sacrifice, weakening the cost visibility at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through establishing "hammered repose" - a new equilibrium between sound and silence. The accumulative structure coheres as sonic disturbance builds to resolution through the stone's placement. However, the cost remains primarily atmospheric rather than sharply felt; the mapkeeper sacrifices little tangible, and the "bloom of hush" arrives without meaningful trade-off beyond effort expended.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the beacon's rekindling and the arrival of the caravan, with visible cost in the custodian's isolation and persistence. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on abstract assertion ("coincidences have meaning") rather than dramatized pressure, and the final "vow" feels unearned without showing the protagonist's actual choice between options.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The archivist's final "steady resolve" to continue his work represents status quo maintenance without earned transformation. The accumulative/textural lens could apply, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake—he simply continues archiving with renewed purpose that was never truly threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve true closure with visible cost. The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the "note in mosaic for any soul daring to watch" but this remains abstract metaphor without concrete stakes being altered. The vow to return reads as continuation rather than transformation, and no path is genuinely foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost - the chronicler observes a conversation's resolution but undergoes no decisive change herself. Causality is weak with events unfolding through mystical sensing rather than because/therefore linkage. The orientation is adequate but the piece reads more as extended description than plotted narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lio's shift from cramped confinement to expansive collection, with visible cost in the "dissolved fear" and foreclosed underground limitation. The accumulative/textural lens coheres through silence-collecting imagery building to the bunker's new "gentle humming." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure lands but the cost feels somewhat abstract—"ready to collect another flavor" suggests continuation rather than true price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with repeated motifs building density toward closure where passengers carry silence within them - a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost appears as "purpose spent" and the vial emptying, though the personal price could be more visceral. The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear quest structure (find stairway → ascend → claim throne) with adequate causality, but the closure lacks visible cost—Mina simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation from "unclaimed" to "claimed" happens without resistance or price, making the Decisive Change mechanically present but emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based intensification through repeated imagery (scars, breathing, starlight). While a Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the sanctuary transforms from isolation to connection, the cost remains abstract—"burning bridges carefully" and "laying each ember" never manifest as concrete losses that alter tactics or create visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation of "pressure into diamonds" as both literal and metaphorical redemption, with visible cost in the protagonist's risk of repeating past exploitation. The accumulative lens holds, though some causal linkages (why this specific person, why now) remain underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear who/where/when anchoring in the opening. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lian transforms "ending a line" from destruction to "transforming silence into a new kind of eloquence" with visible cost (the dynasty's shameful truth). The scroll discovery provides concrete change while the final image of the quiet gramophone beside the open scroll crystallizes the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the knight's final transformation, binding himself to the orchard with "a kiss of frost" that carries clear cost. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated patterns (murmured allegiance, forgotten patterns, reality shifts) that build density toward closure, though some middle transitions between discovery and transformation feel mechanically linked rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with dust patterns revealing histories, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration—Amelia simply continues her work without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The button's discovery initiates accumulation but the ending offers repetition rather than transformation. No clear before/after shift is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the broadcast transforms citizens' consciousness and the lagoon becomes a "living chart" of resistance. The accumulative structure coheres through water imagery and reflection motifs, building to meaningful change. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"collective memory" crushing "indifference"—without visible personal price for Mara or immediate concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that build toward the prophecy's dissolution. Closure occurs through Resonant Reconfiguration as the musician's whispered notes unravel the coded prophecy, though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) establish adequately by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Lira's transformation and the pact between "human care and forest memory," with visible cost in her permanent alteration. The accumulative structure coheres as each monument-building and leaf-reading beat deepens the connection. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Mara transforms from repairing timepieces to creating "a clock that would run on the rhythm of the subterranean waterfall," accepting uncertainty as method. The accumulative texture coheres through water imagery, phosphorescent light, and the "beneath the ashes" motif. Cost appears in her abandonment of "perfect rhythm" for "erratic unison."

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the repaired coin represents both external achievement and internal redemption, with cost legible in the "luminous regret" shifting to "quiet gratitude." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic weight build toward the final transformation. Orientation anchors (alchemist, foundry, after search party) establish cleanly. Deduction for the search party element remaining vague—its dispersal matters but lacks concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's laughter transforms spectral sorrow into redemption, with visible cost in the "luminous ache" that softens in her chest. The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered sensory details building to the transformation, though the joke itself feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory patterns toward a Conceptual Repricing where the strap transforms from shackle to promise. However, the cost remains oblique—we see symbolic transformation but not what Lira sacrifices or risks in this forest journey. The "ultraviolet penance" mechanism never clarifies its rules or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator becomes the lighthouse beacon, but the cost remains abstract ("voices that never found a shore") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final transformation from fragment dissolution to shared memory lacks a concrete, visible price that would elevate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers the ledger and transforms her "weightless burden" into "quiet purpose," with the ghosts' acknowledgment serving as emotional cost. However, the accumulation feels mechanically staged rather than organically pressured, and the orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through frost patterns, ruptures, and cascading transformations. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the library transforms into "a living lattice" with each pane "a portal to a moment of eternal now," showing visible change. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—Mara gains her desire without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the mirror-storm ceremony, but closure lacks decisive cost—the dispute simply "dissolved into a collaborative chorus" without showing what anyone sacrifices. The transformation happens too easily, with no visible price paid for this cultural rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the restored harmony and renewed covenant, with visible cost implied through "centuries pressing" and the threat of collapse. The accumulative progression from decay to renewal holds coherently, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical rather than emotionally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through limestone/water/hush imagery building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts "the place where explanations fail was not a location but a state." Cost is conceptually legible in her surrender of her cataloguing mission, though the magical realism elements (water staircase) strain plausibility without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Mira creates a sculpture and watches visitors appreciate it, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The accumulative lens might apply, but density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure—instead we get repetitive variations on "timewoven alliances" and "reimagine." The ending ("the lantern waits, ready to shine again") evades rather than crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara understands night flowers as "a promise whispered in the dawning hush," with emotional cost visible in her tears and release of "cold doubts." However, the cathedral's hidden layers mechanism feels convenient rather than earned, and the conceptual resolution relies heavily on abstract assertion ("dialogue between darkness and light") rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara broadcasts the decoded entries, transforming the desert's silence into "an echo of justice." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through symbols (beach debris arrangements, obsidian lagoon, violet light) toward this crystallized moment. Cost is visible in the "weight of countless suppressed voices" and the forged "covenant" between sand and sky.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the town's revival via memory, but the transformation lacks visible cost—the alchemist experiences no loss or sacrifice. The accumulative texture builds appropriately, yet the closure feels frictionless. The "deserted" alchemist walking away "his heart light" undercuts any sense of price paid for this resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward Harel's final recording that transforms prophecy into promise. The closure lands with conceptual cost (the loop of preservation feeding future destruction) but the weight feels more asserted than dramatized. Orientation anchors arrive clearly within opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira accepts guardianship of the vortex inheritance, with cost visible in her transformation from seed saver to time-weaver. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details ("shimmering mist that sang lullabies," "tiny gears turning the atrium's clock backward") build toward the final image of "ribbons of green hope." Who/where/when anchored clearly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sensor data, microclimate patterns, and the bell's transformation from harsh clang to "low, steady tone." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the sanctuary becomes "a place where noise yielded to understanding," with the cost being the abandonment of the traditional mechanical system. The piece anchors who/where/when early ("crown of a windblown sanctuary," "storm siren tester") and maintains coherent causality through the technical process.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the janitor achieves "flourishing stillness" and understanding through stellar communion. The cost remains primarily conceptual—accepting vulnerability—but lacks visible price on the page. The orientation anchors (station, janitor, purpose) establish clearly, but the transformation from vulnerability to "quiet fire" needs stronger causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the covenant's revelation and the recluse's ritualistic preservation. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the amber tear seals the covenant anew, with visible cost in the recluse's acceptance of eternal guardianship. However, the covenant's exact nature remains too abstract ("pact between man, bee, and spirit") to fully ground the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Mara's final understanding of time as a walkable tapestry. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the silo becomes a living chronicle, though the cost remains more conceptual than felt—"forever" suggests permanence but doesn't show what Mara sacrifices. The pattern accumulates effectively through layered discoveries (urn fragment → coordinates → hourglass → map), but the final image lacks a sharp, visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the floating feather as "a solitary star, reminding all who watched that dawns are forever woven from fragments." However, the cost remains abstract—we see harmonizing and tending but no sacrifice or foreclosed path. The accumulative pattern works but lacks the visible price required for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the council lifts all time limits after witnessing Mara's transformation, but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral—we're told she faces death but see her mysteriously strengthened instead. The accumulative texture builds through copper-wrapping rituals and botanical observations, yet the resolution relies on magical thinking ("the orchard itself had transferred some of its vigor") that deflates earned causality. The lens holds but the closure's reversal from death to vitality lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Arin realizes "home was not a place but a pattern of returning," with the amber dimming as visible cost. However, the piece suffers from orientation delay (who/where/when aren't fully clear until ~200 words) and the accumulative texture sometimes obscures causal linkage, particularly in how the amber's chemistry connects to the alien response.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the battlefield transforms to garden. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—the coachman sacrifices nothing tangible, and the "narrow vastness" resolution lacks the visible price that would elevate closure beyond thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Rook's purpose transforms from finding bodies to keeping connections, with felt cost in carrying others' voices. The accumulative structure coheres through the cylinder-prism-leaf progression, though the final paragraph's "wild hush" repetition weakens impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered imagery (compass, sketching ritual, temporal dilation) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist commits to mapping possibilities. However, the cost remains largely conceptual—"blessed pariah" status and family loss are declared but not dramatized with felt consequence. The orientation anchors (post-shutdown city, observation deck) arrive clearly by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through chess piece exchanges building to the frost cracking and knowledge flooding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when ancient knowledge floods the chamber with "his own soul expand[ing] like a sunrise." Cost is visible in the "centuries-old betrayal" being amended through patient ritual work.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation into "historian of small gestures," with visible cost in accepting this burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns of walking accumulate meaning toward the scroll's revelation. However, the penumbra's role creates mild causality confusion, and while the interregnum context is mentioned, its specific pressure on Mira's choices remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory memories (pine resin, rain, mother's lullaby) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where home transforms from fixed location to portable melody. The cost appears in "after remembering becomes painful" and the foreclosed possibility of physical shelter. Opening orientation is deliberately dreamlike but anchors the bookstore-mountain and Lira's quest early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the labyrinth journey, with visible cost in the dissolved pawn memory and the protagonist's transformation. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on metaphorical layering that sometimes obscures concrete stakes, and the "time-frozen" conceit never fully integrates with the forgiveness arc.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens with recurring refractions and echoes building toward communal forgiveness, but the closure lacks concrete cost—"the price had already been paid" arrives without showing what was actually sacrificed. The ritual's relationship to the preceding poetry sessions remains causally vague.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the alchemist's narrated story literally repairs the world through kintsugi philosophy, with visible cost in "sealing the alchemist's doubts" and the world achieving tentative wholeness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors of repair. Orientation anchors (workshop, alchemist, floating above acid sea) establish clearly by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the painter discovering shells that contain frozen moments, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration where temporary eternity becomes accessible through art. The closure lands with the painted seashell pulsing as "a living reminder," though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. The journey through caves to hidden oasis provides adequate causality, but the revelation about the previously painted chest feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the fisherman arrives, proving whispers travel farther than shouts, but the cost remains abstract. The accumulative texture builds through garden scent, vibrations, and light imagery, yet lacks concrete stakes or visible price for this validation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the station transforms from "conduit for outward messages" to "beacon for inward journeys," with visible cost in "every name etched into the copper coils." The accumulative/textural lens holds as moon phases, patina deepening, and nightly calls build toward the ships' arrival. Orientation anchors effectively establish the signal station setting and navigator's purpose early.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the glass eye becoming a communal mirror, with visible cost in the smugglers' forced self-confrontation. The causal lens holds as Mara's plan unfolds through deliberate steps. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The "fractured grace" bookending and orchard transformation land with felt consequence, though the smugglers' instant conversion strains believability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Marlowe's acceptance of being "truly seen," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative pattern of gaps-as-memory works conceptually but lacks the density increase or cadence shift that would make the final "promise that no one...will ever be lost to oblivion" land with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian's role transforms from lonely dealer to active guide, with the brass chip enabling this shift. The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern-building. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we understand his choice intellectually but don't experience the weight of what he sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with bleeding starlight as its recurring image, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen absorbs the orb's power. However, the cost remains abstract—"ensuring no future dream would bleed unchecked" states responsibility without showing what she sacrifices. The mystical resolution (orb bursting, dreams dissolving) lacks concrete stakes or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the group creates lasting light from fleeting presence, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The accumulative structure builds through repetition of key phrases and imagery, yet the transformation from experiment to success happens too smoothly—"the nautilus shell columella curl began to hum" without resistance or price. Who/where/when anchors clearly by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around dream chronicling and nostalgia, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the grave transforms from death marker to "marker for stories yet to tell." The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—the narrator's realization about the grave doesn't foreclose paths or exact a visible price, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena realizes she can "sense the world by mapping its emotional topography," but this arrives through accumulation of metaphors rather than dramatized action. The cost—her lost sense of smell—is backstory rather than active sacrifice, and the closure lacks visible present-tense price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where scars transform into "luminous verses." The ritual accumulates symbolic weight through repeated imagery (breath, crystallization, dissolution), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we see transformation but not what Lira sacrifices or risks in the process.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through perfume, music, and memory toward the apology's manifestation. The closure (sending the apology on induced currents as trees fall) occurs on page but lacks visible cost—we don't see what the exorcist sacrifices or how Mara receives it, making the "imperfect miracle" abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the spiral arbitration completing its cycle and the witness vanishing "like a breath of wind." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt - we understand the transformation intellectually but don't experience what the witness sacrifices or gains personally.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and repetitive actions build toward the Conceptual Repricing that clocks measure "intervals between breaths of the world." The cost appears as the shepherd's acceptance of his role within this larger rhythm ("his own breath was part of the count"), though the price could be more viscerally felt rather than philosophically stated.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with adequate coherence but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending offers conceptual resolution about connection and letting go, but no on-page price is paid or path foreclosed. The laser system's successful test and storm response provide progression without meaningful transformation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with symbolic discovery replacing causal pressure. The closure (writing a new theorem) achieves Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost—"she knew that her work would be theoretically rebellious" tells rather than shows the price. The underground journey accumulates meaning but doesn't fundamentally alter Mara's options or force a true trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered calls adding to the harmonica disc's loop until Mara steps out of the booth, accepting communion over estrangement—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost of her practiced isolation. Orientation anchors clearly (tunnel, Mara, phone booth) and the pattern of wrong-number accumulation teaches its logic early.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration - the archivist simply continues his eternal task without alteration. The "regenerated covenant" concept never manifests as concrete stakes or choices, remaining abstract throughout. No visible cost emerges from any action, and the piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve the required density shift or pattern break that would reweight meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the moon rock's chime creates ripples of connection, with felt cost in the "fleeting lift" and ongoing reciprocity chain. The accumulative structure coheres, though the ivy-cutting puzzle feels mechanically inserted. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well - sensory details build systematically toward the stillpoint revelation where Lira steps "through the veil of sound into a quiet blaze of inner light." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("love, loss, and hope" convergence), and the pattern of musical/sensory accumulation holds throughout, though the emotional cost could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around the pen's phosphorescent traces, but closure lacks visible cost—the data simply corrects itself without sacrifice or trade-off. The "editing history" concept never faces concrete stakes or resistance, resolving through magical convenience rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Arlen's ritual creating the harbor's silent music, then Lira discovering and continuing the practice. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Lira's vow to "return to map silence" carries no stakes or sacrifice. The Resonant Reconfiguration attempts to land through "creation thrives even in forgotten moments" but remains conceptually abstract without dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the arsonist's transformation into guardian, with visible cost in his redemptive murals. However, the accumulative structure suffers from excessive backstory (~35% of text) that summarizes rather than dramatizes key discoveries, and the phoenix revelation feels mechanically convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's drumming transforming the lab's sterile protocols into "compassionate collaboration," with visible cost in the accumulated memories of forgotten patients. However, the mechanism by which drumming reaches staff dreams and changes policy feels unearned—the causal link between sound waves and institutional change needs stronger grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (test legend → follow map → find proof) but the closure lacks visible cost—Milo gets exactly what he sought without sacrifice or transformation. The "whispers travel farther than shouts" revelation reads as confirmation rather than reconfiguration. The accumulative elements (storm, map, coin) build atmosphere but don't compound pressure toward a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    No clear closure with visible cost - the guardian completes its teaching but nothing fundamentally changes in the story world or for any character. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks the density increase or pattern break that would create meaningful escalation. The fisherman's late appearance feels tacked on rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure lacks visible cost - the town simply transforms without resistance or sacrifice. The accumulative pattern of synchronized windows building to community change is present but mechanically executed. Most critically, "the quiet has spoken" and the town's transformation occur without any on-page price paid or path foreclosed, violating the cost requirement for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara releases the scrimshaw and gains the island's heart within herself, with visible cost (letting go of inheritance). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery and motifs build toward the whale's call. Orientation anchors (dock worker, harbor, day after violence) establish cleanly by ~50 words. The cost could be more visceral at the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern and cadence shifts building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the closure's cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"a silence that now seemed less imposed and more chosen" doesn't show what Mara sacrifices or risks. The happiness mandate context is underutilized as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the poet's verse transforms the frozen lake and dissolves boundaries, with cost implied in "the night a cloud-shadow poet rewrote the boundaries of sky." However, the accumulative progression lacks distinct pressure points between opening and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, with the reed-tongue mechanism established early and building through successive plant arrangements toward Selene's perceptual shift. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where "imperfection was the truest melody" reweights her artistic practice with visible cost (abandoning her quest for perfect symmetry). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern-teaching of plant-to-color translation maintains causality within the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sensory layering ("golden shadows," "velvety hum," "texture of connection"). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the artificial mind responds with "a soft sigh...like a hand reaching across a void," though cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure through the rose's revival and coordinate-bearing cranes spreading renewal. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we see transformation but not what the protagonist sacrifices or risks. The "curtains of intention" metaphor attempts conceptual repricing but lacks the concrete price that would make the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration - the cartomancer simply declares she has "found her purpose" without demonstrating what shifted or what it cost her. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a closure moment with legible stakes or transformation. "In the inherited mystery, she had found her purpose" tells rather than shows the supposed revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the historian abandons certainty and becomes "one more atom of nostalgia," with cost visible in his tears and the sacrifice of pattern. However, the accumulative structure lacks clear escalation points, and the orientation remains vague (when/where is "the end of innocence"?).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a clear closure with visible cost. The protagonist completes his "mission" of preserving hope in the stone, but this resolution feels declarative rather than earned—we're told he succeeded without seeing what was at stake or what was sacrificed. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain vague throughout, particularly the temporal setting "after dreams become shareable."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure lacks visible cost - the chameleon's tail magically reattaches without consequence, and Mara's "balance" arrives through assertion rather than earned transformation. The con's revelation happens off-page, leaving the central conflict abstract. The accumulative pattern of shedding/reconstruction doesn't culminate in a reconfiguration that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from tower to tunnel to revelation, with the displaced miracle concept paying off through the hourglass ritual. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where wounds become "doorways to another displaced miracle" with felt cost in the years of seeking. Minor deduction for the child's story feeling inserted rather than organically discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece successfully builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where stored love transforms into "something bright" and releases. The cost is felt through "the weight of unsent affection" and the emotional cascade, though the transformation's mechanics remain somewhat abstract ("celluloid frames to melt into liquid light").

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The dreamer traces stars, releases creativity, and walks away - but no path is foreclosed, nothing is lost or transformed. The "freedom" achieved lacks visible price; the protagonist simply completes his task without sacrifice or genuine change. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately early.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the guard's successful kindling of new light from ashes, with the cost being his perpetual dreamless service. The progression from ash to light coheres, though the "divergent archive" mechanism remains somewhat opaque, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the philosopher's consciousness expands and he carries "the hum of insight like a lantern." The accumulative structure builds appropriately, but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The piece teaches its pattern of mechanical-organic fusion early and maintains it, though the transformation could land with more concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's discovery of "unused courage" with visible cost (the journey through indirect routes, the cave exploration). The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered imagery. However, the cost could be more visceral - the "bright star now etched upon her soul" veers toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a legible closure with cost. The ending ("hope can remain") offers abstract assertion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration earned through prior accumulation. The bolt placement and color shift suggest transformation but lead nowhere causal—guests simply "emerge with new understanding" without dramatized realization or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands with the pretender unmasked and the temple collapsing—a decisive change with visible cost as "ancient stones sang a low hymn of graceful collapse." The causal chain from finding the pellet through following cryptic messages to confronting the false crown is clear. However, the spectral emergence feels slightly convenient, and the cost remains more atmospheric than personally felt by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery, but closure lacks decisive change—recording the discovery and planning to teach others feels procedural rather than transformative. The "delayed revelation" of the watermark provides knowledge but no visible cost or foreclosed path. Orientation is clear but the stakes never crystallize into a choice that matters.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through sensory layering (hum, vibration, dust spirals) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the stargazer accepts her role as keeper of cycles. Cost is legible in "relentless hum" and the weight of keeping "the flame alive," though the transformation mechanism (stone circle's power) strains credibility without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The unsealing ritual creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (Anara's youth memories). The accumulative structure builds from telepathic discovery through decoding to embryo awakening, teaching its pattern early. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the protagonist moving through the arboretum while processing trauma. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—she chooses to continue living with her grief rather than being consumed by it. However, the cost remains largely abstract ("ready to plant her own beacon of hope") rather than concrete, and the piece lacks a decisive present-moment pressure point that would elevate the closure beyond therapeutic processing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian accepts fragmentation as artistic method. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt—"the luminous ache captured in oil and ink" tells rather than shows the price of transformation. The orientation anchors (lighthouse library, Elian as artist) land clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve valid closure with visible cost on the page. Kael's declaration to "share the knowledge" lacks concrete stakes or sacrifice, reading as intention rather than action. The disappearing ink revelation about time's pause is conceptual exposition without dramatized consequence or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the spread of dissent via dormant networks, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence breaks into dialogue. Cost is visible in Maren risking "frozen preservation" and the melting ice revealing green shoots, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical in its unanimous awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the desert rose farm's recovery, building through repeated imagery toward communal healing. However, the closure lacks sharp cost - villagers taking rose petals feels ceremonial rather than consequential. The "tranquil blaze" motif accumulates but doesn't crystallize into a decisive reconfiguration with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the fisher captures the echo and releases it as song, with some conceptual cost implied ("to catch the echo of a goddess was not to trap it, but to set it free"). However, the cost remains largely abstract—we don't see what the fisher sacrifices or how this changes his options concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change (ledger discovered, accountability initiated) with visible cost implied through "orbits of regret" unwinding. However, the causal chain from pen nib to decryption feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through struggle. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the laboratory transforms from "mausoleum" to "sanctuary," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The accumulative pattern builds adequately through amber/beetle/lullaby imagery, yet the closure's "people arrived with broken lullabies" feels tacked on rather than inevitable. The lens holds but the transformation lacks visible price—Lyra pays nothing tangible for her peace.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the accumulation of "emergent hush" imagery, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The violinist coda dilutes rather than deepens the closure, introducing a second POV that wasn't taught by the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the plaza transforms from shattered remnant to pilgrimage site, with clear cost in the "aberrant mercy" that doesn't flood but cools grief. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through repeated mosaic imagery and the "warm coldness" paradox that reweights at the ending, though orientation anchors (who the radical is, why he's there) remain slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the ghost discovering the coin, performing in the orchard, and achieving peace through the shopkeeper's wish—a Resonant Reconfiguration with implied cost (the ghost's dissolution). However, the shopkeeper's sudden appearance and ability to wish lacks causal grounding, and the cost remains abstract ("at peace") rather than viscerally felt. The fractured timeline concept is declared but never dramatized through concrete temporal disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Mara discovering she can create "feedback loops" between light, the geode, and neural patterns, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where skepticism transforms into "willowglass hope." However, the cost remains abstract—we see no concrete sacrifice or foreclosed path, only philosophical reframing without dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she understands "to become the voice of the unknown was not to speak for others, but to amplify the silence." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the caves singing. Cost is visible in her patient waiting through hibernation cycles. Slight opacity around the humans' hibernation mechanics prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well—buttons accumulate meaning, the echo builds resonance, and these converge into a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara steps onto the sand bridge. Cost is visible in the "weight of each grain" and the irreversible transformation. The prophecy's unscrambling provides clear before/after. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some causality softness in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the "silver hush" motif and snow codes building toward redemption, but the closure lacks visible cost—the spy drinks water and feels renewed without paying a concrete price. The transformation from "burned spy" to "guarding the future" happens through abstract realization rather than a decisive change with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost—Arlen simply rides away feeling peaceful after the fog lifts. The "promise" accepting and "secret woven" remain conceptually vague without dramatized change. Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the lantern's awakening of the hives reweights the oasis's fractured nature from brokenness to protective resilience. The cost (offering kindness to a dead place) is present but abstract, lacking visceral weight. The who/where/when anchors establish clearly within the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara transforms the harbor through luminous vines, with the "quivering hush" settling into "a settled chorus." The cost remains primarily conceptual—her "fragile offering" and continued seasonal commitment—rather than viscerally felt. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered imagery (clouds, whale bones, resonating scripts) toward Mira's transformation. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms to independence, but the cost remains abstract—"forged from isolation" tells rather than shows the price paid. The brass sundial ritual creates change but lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira "rejoins" the chorus of hidden stories, but the cost remains entirely abstract. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. Critical flaw: no visible or felt cost appears on the page—Mira simply walks through an installation and feels satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through collective harmony emerging from individual resistance, with visible cost in the community's transformation. However, the escalation from signal detection to valley-wide chorus feels rushed and mechanically convenient. The closure lands with thematic weight but the causal mechanics of how subsonic frequencies achieve unity remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the compass's spatial manipulation building toward discovery, but the closure's conceptual shift to "rebellion against forgetting" lacks visible cost on the page. The line "he understood that the rebellion he had sparked was not against stone, but against the forgetting of stories" attempts Conceptual Repricing but arrives as assertion rather than earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward revelation, but the closure relies on magical realism (stone crying, quarry speaking) without establishing these rules early. The cold cases resolution happens through mystical communion rather than character agency, and the cost remains conceptual ("dormant empathy awakens") without concrete stakes. Orientation suffers as the connection between portrait painting and solving cold cases never clarifies causally.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (verses lead to chamber, nail discovery prompts protection decision, storm forces action) with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara transforms dread into discovery. The cost is visible in the permanent embedding of the nail and the acceptance of "spongey dread" as a necessary reminder. However, the ancestor's "reversible exile" concept remains conceptually muddy, and the jet stream's role feels ornamental rather than essential to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost - the fiddler simply completes his mystical task without sacrifice or transformation. The hitchhiker's "return in song" reads as assertion rather than dramatized change. Causality breaks when the glass flake somehow captures and grants amnesty through unexplained magical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the circus train sequence and foreign currency motifs. However, the closure—Arlen walking toward a new co-working space—reads more as continuation than reconfiguration, lacking visible cost. The piece teaches its pattern of loops and markers but the final "measured hope" arrives without dramatized price or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens but fails to deliver closure with cost. Mara decodes the temple and finds a crystal, but this discovery doesn't reconfigure her options or exact a price—it merely confirms what the telegram already told her. The piece reads as a series of mystical discoveries without causal linkage or escalating pressure, ending in validation rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract—we're told she moves from "war to peace" but never see what specific path is foreclosed or what she sacrifices. The ritual mechanics (expanding circles, melting ice) function more as magical procedure than causal pressure. The orientation is clear but the accumulative pattern doesn't build sufficient weight to justify the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical discovery, but closure lacks visible cost—the visionary simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation ("root-bound visionary would become the bridge") is declared rather than dramatized through concrete change. While the covenant's revelation reweights the world, we don't see what the protagonist loses or risks in this role.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maelia's ritual completion that transforms both her soul and the orchard, with visible cost in the "bartered destinies." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through repeated imagery of roots, bones, and stitching. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—we don't see what specific destiny she sacrifices or feel the price of the exchange beyond conceptual description.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost - the ending merely restates the protagonist's intent without demonstrating actual change or foreclosing options. The "lesson" in the ledger and morning arrival of a client feel like soft resolution rather than earned reconfiguration with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed's sprouting and Lira's decision to test it in the valleys, but the cost remains abstract ("haunted ambitions" becoming "shared enlightenment"). The accumulative lens holds but the final transformation from magnetic arbor to earthly soil lacks visible price - we don't see what Lira risks or loses in this transition.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the librarian accepts identity migration and creates participatory stories. Cost is visible in his softening gears and releasing control. The "tomorrow disappeared" element disrupts orientation briefly but pays off thematically. Closure lands with felt transformation though the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara becomes "keeper of light" with the cost of carrying others' sorrows. The pattern of confession-absorption-transformation coheres, though the cost remains primarily conceptual ("weight of her new role") rather than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (crystal caves, Mara as inspector, quest for pearl) establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of walking toward the horizon with "the patched accordion bellows humming a low hymn of hope," showing earned acceptance with visible cost ("bruised with dusk"). The accumulative structure coheres as each element (graffiti wisdom, river truth, accordion breath) builds toward the promise to return "daringly methodical" until forgiveness arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught reversals and propagation delays, but closure lacks decisive change or visible cost—the discovery leads only to documentation without transformation. Who/where/when anchors establish adequately by ~120 words. The "cyclically reversed" pattern coheres but the ending merely extends the quest rather than reconfiguring stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the floating city rises autonomous while the empire shares resources, with visible cost in shared grief. The accumulative lens holds as coffee readings, vine whispers, and violin music layer toward this reconfiguration, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the emerald chip becomes a beacon of hope against oblivion, with visible cost in the aurora's dimming. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through pattern-finding in static to the final charged image. Orientation anchors (skyborne grotto, aurora, beautician mortician) establish early. Deduction for somewhat abstract stakes that lack immediate personal cost beyond the cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's understanding of contentment shifts from hidden treasure to cyclical care, with visible cost in accepting endless tending. The accumulative structure builds through ritual actions (climbing, hairpin alignment, returning to vines) toward this reweighting. However, the piece over-explains its thematic closure ("knowing the cycle had turned once more") and the temporal scope stretches thin for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through wind chimes, but closure lacks decisive cost—the magistrate's acceptance of the "cloak of doubt" reads as convenient rather than earned transformation. The piece teaches its symbolic system early but the final reconfiguration ("a living conversation") remains abstract without visible price. Orientation anchors clearly at the lighthouse but the conceptual mechanics of "conscience for hire" never crystallize into dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira discovers "the art of appearing just as one chose to vanish" - a conceptual repricing of her condition with clear cost ("a lesson she had been withholding all along"). The accumulative structure builds through ripples, magnetic pull, and sycamore imagery toward this earned revelation, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative structure coheres well as patterns layer (pulse→arrowhead→birds→internal map) toward the Earned Stasis closure where she achieves navigation through understanding rather than movement. The cost is legible in "weathered resolve" and the choice to "slip into silence." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagery building toward transformation, but closure lacks visible cost—Selric gains power without losing anything concrete. The journey up the spire and touching the keystone create a before/after, yet the price remains conceptual ("releasing the weight of expectation"). Orientation is clear, but the transformation feels unearned without dramatized struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward Eli's discovery. The closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing as sound's color becomes visible, though the cost remains abstract—"to keep seeking colors hidden in every sound" lacks tangible sacrifice. Causality holds but the transformation from seeking to finding happens too easily, without the resistance that would make the discovery feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Silas discovering purpose as "frequency" rather than destination, reweighting all prior seeking. The backwards prophecy pays off through concrete action (turning the final coin) with felt cost ("doubts still lingered like distant stars"). Orientation anchors clearly (observatory deck, Silas, coin interpretation). Slight deduction for the extended coda after primary closure that adds reflection without deepening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres well, building from the atlas discovery through crystallization to naming and release. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as naming transforms grief into gratitude, with visible cost in the "centuries of unfinished farewells." The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by line 2-3, and the pattern of naming-as-release teaches itself through action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the bell's restoration bringing cosmic rebalance, with the dripping rates creating rhythmic coherence. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual ("brittle devotion" enduring) rather than viscerally felt, and the fish returning feels convenient rather than earned through the established mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as Caitlyn uncovers truth through photographs, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's shared narrative is restored. The closure lands with the town "breathing anew" and the myth expunged, showing clear before/after change. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"the weight of truth lift"—without dramatized sacrifice or visible price paid by Caitlyn herself.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Selene achieves her sought harmony with visible cost (the crystal's explosion, physical sensation of transformation). The ritual structure provides clear causality from preparation through transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines. Cost is legible in "the touch of wonder surged through her veins" and the permanent change to the orchard, though the price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but closure lacks decisive cost - the protagonist simply continues his role without meaningful change or sacrifice. The "watcher's burden" lifts "fractionally" then returns, creating circular stasis rather than earned transformation. No clear before/after is legible despite atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story reaches closure through the Duplicate's awakening and subsequent partnership resolution, but the cost remains abstract—"emotional numbness cracking" lacks visible price. The floating dojo setting and clone custody battle create an ambitious conceptual framework that obscures basic orientation; we never understand the practical mechanics of how history "rewrites itself" or what ego death actually meant for Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the seed's growth paralleling the puzzle-solving, but closure lacks visible cost—the bloom simply happens as planned without sacrifice or trade-off. The final paragraphs assert thematic meaning ("safeguarding space for innovation meant more than protecting walls") without dramatizing what Mara risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered metaphors (conductor/leaf blower/lullaby) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence transforms to restored laughter. Cost appears in "eyes wet with gratitude" and the conductor's disappearance, though the restoration feels too complete—"the house would now hear laughter again" lacks lingering tension or genuine price.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the guardian's transformation into curator, with the garden becoming a living exchange rather than frozen archive. The accumulative lens holds as textural elements (mist, frost, pages) build toward this shift. Cost appears in the "endless" waiting and the risk of the garden's "fragile order" collapsing, though the emotional price could be more visceral at the moment of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the crozier's revival and the alchemist's destiny transformation, with visible cost in the "creative destruction" process and the repeated failures before success. The accumulative structure coheres well through the penny-drop timeframe and successive approximation method, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than abstractly stated ("stifling destiny as a crystal cage").

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the chord broadcasting and village awakening, with some conceptual cost in transforming decay to rebirth. However, the accumulative pattern lacks sufficient density increase, and the cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when "the ferry never vanished again" with visible cost paid through Lio's transformation of reality. The pattern teaches itself through repetition (spectral grotto, vanishing ferry, empty hourglass) and pays off when sand rises against gravity, marking successful timeline merger.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres through pattern repetition (weaving → eruption → transformation) and achieves closure through Conceptual Repricing when "imagination can be measured" and "the unreal can have realistic weight." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt - we understand the bridge exists but don't feel what crossing it costs the architect.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks a decisive closure unit—Mira's final whisper and the city's brightening lights suggest continuation rather than transformation with cost. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, but the story accumulates description without building toward a moment where options narrow or meaning crystallizes with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator commits to guarding echoes, with felt cost in accepting responsibility for "vulnerable voices still whispering." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details cascade toward the final image. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, lacking a concrete price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure (burying the codex) constitutes a Decisive Change with implied cost, but causality weakens through unmotivated phase transitions and convenient technology. The accumulative lens builds atmosphere effectively but the "return protocol" and dimensional slip lack earned linkage to prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Mara recognizes the ghost as mirror rather than threat, with clear cost (her legal non-existence). The hybrid lens holds as accumulative patterns (ink, heartbeats, resonance) build toward causal resolution. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence where understanding arrives too cleanly through the ghost's "crystalline whispers."

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the storyteller transforms texture into a "language of memory" sealed in the canyon walls. The accumulative pattern holds as bird flights, echo patterns, and diamond fractures converge into a preserved language. However, the cost—"knowing that across the death of a language he had given texture a voice"—remains conceptual rather than felt, and the precise nature of what's lost or sacrificed stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes "a vessel of its own laughter" with felt cost ("the weight of years of dead ends turning into a joke"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery builds toward transformation. Orientation anchors arrive late (underground garden context) but serve the mysterious opening.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the orchard transforms from oppressed to liberated, with visible cost in the "uprooting" of the mechanical regime's order. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the violinist's heart-rhythm signals building to transformation. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt, and the who/where/when anchoring takes too long to clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the storm's release creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—rival drones cross paths in acknowledgment. Clear who/where/when established early (Milo, cobalt arcade, twilight). The cost appears in the storm's depletion and the "dust of old grudges" washing away, though the conceptual price of peace could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's discovery that her craft is "listening to the void and turning it into song," with visible transformation of the abandoned train. However, the accumulative structure loses some coherence through excessive layering of mystical elements without clear stakes. Cost exists but remains abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful closure—Mara simply continues her nightly routine after a successful memory projection. The Accumulative/Textural lens could work but there's no density increase or pattern break that reweights stakes; instead we get repetitive descriptions of the same mystical process. No visible cost emerges from her actions, violating the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing through "longing, when shared, becomes a light" but the cost remains entirely abstract - no concrete price is paid or path foreclosed. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive change with legible stakes. Orientation is clear but the conceptual drift from photography to pearl-chasing to shared longing lacks coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver genuine closure with visible cost. The "freed idea" becoming a "luminous filament" that "danced across the night" lacks concrete consequence—we never see what was sacrificed or foreclosed by this liberation. The ending dissolves into abstract assertions about hope and longing without dramatizing any actual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered imagery (broken constellations, fairy rings, shipwrecks) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where memories return as songs. The closure lands with the greenhouse standing "as a testament" and memories "rooted in hearts," showing transformation. However, the cost feels abstract rather than visceral—we see recovery but not what was sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "the library breathed a sigh of relief, its heart beating anew" after the shadow dissolves and walls heal themselves. The accumulative lens holds as tea-leaf patterns, annotations, and shadow-work cohere toward restoration. Deduction for slightly mechanical resolution where every element resolves too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the orchard becomes "a tapestry of light" bridging worlds, with the traveler's arrival confirming the transformation's reach. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral - we see wonder restored but not what was sacrificed to achieve it. The accumulative lens holds but lacks the decisive pressure that would elevate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based intensification through knot-untying. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sanctuary achieves "purest peace" through accumulated silence, with cost shown in the spirits' release and Elara's "lucid unrest." However, the orientation remains somewhat abstract (who are these spirits, what specific grief?) and the transformation lacks sharp before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (rain/stone/map/footage). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when "the whispered chapel now alive with a muted chorus" creates Charged Poise—options crystallized but cost implied rather than paid on-page. Strong causality through video alignment revealing glyphs, though the exact transformation mechanism ("energy to seep") remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with the snow globe shattering into "tiny stars drifting upward" and Mort's dissolution into the deep. Cost is legible through "unsaid goodbyes" and the physical destruction. However, the accumulative pattern could be tighter—some middle passages meander without deepening the central metaphor of untangling/release.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through three lightning strikes that deepen connection between balladeer and ghost, culminating in the courtyard's transformation to "living archive." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the ghost folding into permanent mural and future travelers adding verses. Cost appears conceptually in the ghost's satisfied dissolution and the balladeer's encoded longing, though the emotional price remains oblique rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the servant discovering and retrieving stored joy, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where anguish transforms to contentment. The closure lands with "the soft, affectionate detachment of a heart that loves without being consumed," though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of broken strings humming "spooled wholeness," but the cost remains abstract—we never see what Aria sacrifices or risks by this vigil. The accumulative pattern of cloud-emotion cataloging builds texture without clear stakes. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established, but the "after the string broke" timeline creates confusion about whether this is immediate aftermath or ritual remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story accumulates vivid imagery but lacks a clear closure unit with legible cost. The building falls yet "the tree's interior remained a cathedral of sky"—a physical impossibility that breaks established rules without signaling altered reality. The final "defiance" and the tree's survival feel unearned; no decisive change or reconfiguration lands with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through the hopscotch squares and phrasebook fragments leading to the luminance's manifestation. Closure occurs as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the luminance integrates with the ship's systems, though the cost remains primarily conceptual ("without draining the ship's own life-force") rather than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the repaired clock transforms the library from frozen to sunrise-lit, with visible cost in the locksmith's "heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia." The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered imagery. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the physical/metaphysical nature of the transformation, though the cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the bell-ringing climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community commits to seasonal repetition, though the cost remains abstract ("brambled hope" rather than specific sacrifice). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with planet, orchards, and ghost established.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the lighthouse transforms from "beacon of warning" to "keeper of peace," with clear cost in Elara's "bruised awe of having saved a moment that could never be reclaimed." The accumulative structure coheres through nested patterns of sound, light, and time that build toward the final image. Minor deduction for some orientation delay - we don't fully understand the stakes of the "doomsday clock adjuster" role until mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern accumulates toward the ritual's completion with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - travelers escape while the curse persists. Cost is visible in "the orchard will sigh again tomorrow, demanding a new caretaker" showing cyclical price. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the blueprint concept which never fully crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal chain from failure through insight to solution, with a Decisive Change closure (empty chrysalis transformed to functioning bridge). The cost is visible - Mara's divergent path from lab safety. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2. The Lio addition weakens causality slightly but doesn't break the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when "a new story had been born." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—the vendor's "weight of his quest dissolve[s]" without showing what that weight was. The closure lands but lacks the visceral price needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the coral pavilion's dissolution releases centuries of stored grief, transforming the fortress from brittle to resilient. Cost is visible in the physical breaking of the coral and the "soft sandstorm" that carries away remorse. The tidal pool analysis provides causal linkage between understanding memory's patterns and the ability to transform it, though the resolution feels slightly convenient without deeper personal stakes for Lir.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with silos transformed into "singing bridges of hope" and the city breathing "as one," showing clear before/after with emotional cost in the workers' awakening to lost families and imagined futures. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the transformation feels slightly rushed for the scope attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Aria becomes "a living archive," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The accumulative structure coheres around memory-retrieval, yet the transformation from engineer to archeologist lacks concrete stakes. No clear "before/after" legibility emerges because we never see what Aria gives up or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora shifts from seeking forgotten combinations to tending vigilance as living lamps, with the "latent blaze" becoming "an open flame that would never die." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no genuine sacrifice or foreclosed option makes the transformation's price visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the grove's transformation from silence to resonant archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through crack-reading and strumming patterns. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—the grove "breathes" differently, but Auris pays no personal price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-heavy prose building toward a conceptual repricing, but the closure—"rewriting the covenant"—remains abstract without visible cost or concrete change. The magnetic nexus setting and chess metaphors accumulate but never crystallize into a decisive moment that makes before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the workshop transforms into a teaching space. While the closure lands with the "Symphony of Stillness" and opened doors, the cost remains abstract—we see collective breath released but no concrete price paid by the protagonist or specific stakes foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration through the corpse flower's bloom, but the cost remains abstract - "the scent of deep truth" and villagers breathing in "wildflower hush." No concrete price is paid; Lira achieves her goal without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative texture builds but lacks the decisive intensification needed for stronger closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration - Mira releases the arrow tip to perpetuate growth cycles, fundamentally changing the orchard's future. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt through Mira personally. The accumulative structure coheres but the who/where/when orientation takes too long to crystallize (past 120 words), though it serves the otherworldly atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around wind documentation, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration with cost. The vortex "releasing pent-up pressure in a gentle sigh" and town's pulse returning presents resolution without visible price—Mara simply succeeds. No path is foreclosed, no opportunity lost, no stance crystallized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the bell ringer enters, performs her song, and leaves with the world "unaware," creating a static tableau rather than a story with consequence. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks even the density increase or pattern break that would create closure under that lens. Cost remains entirely abstract ("beauty could be unfettered") without visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure when Mara understands "why the guardianship had ended" - a reweighting of failure's value. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative lens holds but the "weaving between worlds" section feels disconnected from the dominant stake of learning from failure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure ("emotion is not a static variable but a transposed function") lands with visible cost as the halo fragment cracks and releases accumulated personalities. The accumulative structure coheres through density increase toward this reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive late but serve the lyric mode; the cost becomes legible through the fragment's destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through episodic encounters that deepen the pendant's power and legacy. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ridgeway becoming a pilgrimage site where "wonder can be coaxed from even the most routine of paths." Cost is felt through the courier's jittery urgency and the absent mentor's lingering influence, though the final transformation could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora proves emotions inhabit objects, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The line "she also felt the weight of responsibility" declares rather than dramatizes price. The accumulative pattern builds adequately but the closure lacks a visible sacrifice or foreclosed option that would elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's sacrifice transforms into "the loom of tomorrow," with visible cost in the dimmed amber bead and her acceptance of loss. The accumulative structure coheres through the weaving metaphor and puzzle-path progression. Deducting for slight ambiguity in what exactly Mara sacrifices beyond the abstract "something of herself."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the silk acquisition and subsequent forge transformation serving as closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the blade that "knits the broken ground," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Causality holds but the "bartered awakening" mechanism feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the crew awakens and the shard fragments into stars, with the cost being the shard's destruction. The accumulative lens holds as sensory patterns build toward this transformation, though the parallel universe mechanics feel somewhat convenient rather than earned through prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to establish clear closure with visible cost. The ritual's purpose and mechanics remain opaque—why does stacking stones create a "network of hope"? The magical realism elements (glowing stones, pulsing spiral) appear without established rules. Most critically, the ending "he returned, his heart alight" provides no legible change or cost, merely asserting transformation without dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the lighthouse beam redirecting inward to birth a "new dawn," with cost implied in "strange, joyous melancholy." However, the accumulative lens wavers—the ritual's mechanics (prism, phosphorescent algae, newspaper) accumulate without clear causal linkage, and the transformation from steering storms to painting dawn lacks concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Lira's understanding that "stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution," with the loom becoming a beacon, but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward the final crystallization, though the revelation arrives without sufficient resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where "quantified sorrow" transforms into "measurable peace," with the labyrinth's walls no longer echoing "unmeasured grief." The accumulative structure coheres through repeated moon/healing imagery and the sextant's transformation. Cost is present but somewhat abstract - we see sorrow lifting and peace arriving, though the personal price Eli pays remains oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks, but the closure lacks visible cost—Lira whispers promises and feels purpose without sacrificing anything concrete. The transformation from endless night to "gentle, unstoppable sunrise" occurs through symbolic action (singing, light-scattering) without a clear before/after that makes loss legible. Who/where/when anchors are established early.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical elements building toward the mirror revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—the recluse simply gains insight and leaves peacefully. The orientation is deliberately dreamlike but never anchors basic reality (is the library real or metaphorical?), and the "staying while leaving" paradox resolves without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    This reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern-building through garden/palace/bread imagery culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tea house "uncloak[s] its hidden purpose." However, no visible cost appears on-page—the bread's discovery and sharing create atmosphere without foreclosing options or exacting price. The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words (palace, twilight, gardener-figure).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion." Cost is conceptual—the weight of vows settling on shoulders—though more concrete price would strengthen. The progression from measuring silence to awakening the slide to final vow coheres well, but the middle section's causality between frequency measurement and slide activation remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Lila maintains the truce until sunrise, accepting the cyclical nature of conflict. The watch fob's placement on the negotiating table and its final warmth against her chest creates a before/after with felt cost: "knowing that until sunrise she had kept the truce, and that tomorrow would bring new false starts." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and repeated motifs (watch fob, truce of hush, comforting unease) build toward this acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Arin recognizes himself as a weather carrier, but this arrives through passive observation and abstract realization rather than earned transformation. The cost ("personal weather he had learned to navigate") is retrospectively declared rather than dramatized on the page. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from crystal cave discovery through portrait creation to creative unlocking, with the guardian revelation serving as effective resonant reconfiguration. Cost registers through "suppressed creativity" being released and Lena's promise to return "whenever the world above grew dim," though the mystical elements sometimes obscure concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where speaking truth literally heals the toxic sky. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (the calligrapher's defiance of authority) and conceptual payoff (candor restoring worlds). Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines. The zinc plate's consistent reaction to truth/lies provides a persistent constraint that shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—the story presents a static portrait of ongoing dedication without a before/after transformation. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks the required density increase or pattern break that would create closure with cost. The final "Thus hope glistens" attempts closure through assertion rather than earned dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the box transforms from "repository of fear" to "seed of calm," with visible cost in Vira's released vigilance and the burned thorns. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring organic/machine tension, though the miniaturization mechanism feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final moment with the child, but the cost remains abstract—we see community healing but no personal price Mara pays. The accumulative structure holds but lacks the density increase or pattern break needed for stronger escalation under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through dance, cipher work, and the recurring dice imagery, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lab rises "like a phoenix" and Selene's encoded vulnerability becomes shared strength. The closure lands with felt cost (the lab's collapse as liberation) and the who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2. However, the accumulation relies heavily on metaphorical layering rather than concrete pressure that narrows options, and some transitions between beats feel associative rather than causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Mara's discovery of compressed memories. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she recovers the whale's song and understands memories persist in gravity pockets, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the prophecy sealed "within the wing's quiet glow" and the world stepping "into the smoothed hush." The accumulative structure builds coherently through ritual stages, with cost visible in the irreversible transformation of the sacred origami. Minor orientation wobble with "whispered secrets" timeframe but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density through meteor shower, stone language, and agreed-upon lies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator becomes "newly fluent" in stone's grammar. The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting lies as "stepping stones toward truth"—and the final image of learning "to listen to the creak of a window latch as if it were a word" reweights the entire mystical framework. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed transition from single meeting to established weekly ritual without showing the intermediate acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira transforms isolation into independence. The cost is conceptually present ("tragically radiant reminder that every ending is merely a new archive") but lacks visceral weight. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern of accumulation through the seashell's whispers builds coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page change or crystallized choice with visible cost. Liora completes her ritual of forgiveness, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid beyond metaphorical "lifting" of weight. The ending reads as predetermined completion rather than earned transformation, missing the required closure effect despite accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with progressive revelation building toward Resonant Reconfiguration where the singer gains understanding and the shell becomes whole. Cost is present but primarily conceptual—the weight of carrying others' stories—rather than visceral. The serpentine path structure supports the accumulative design, though the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing - the realization that purity must be reassembled from collective fragments rather than salvaged whole. The accumulative lens holds as dream fragments build toward this reconfiguration. Cost appears in "borrowed starlight solidified in her veins" suggesting transformation's price, though the emotional weight could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to achieve closure with visible cost. The philosopher's realization about "hidden patterns" and his "promise to return" constitute neither a Decisive Change nor a Resonant Reconfiguration—nothing forecloses a path or crystallizes options with felt consequence. The story loops back to the beginning without meaningful transformation, merely restating its premise about appreciating unseen effort.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (investigation → reconstruction → discovery → understanding) but the closure lacks visible cost—Mira gains knowledge and power without sacrificing anything meaningful. The "stillpoint as mental state" revelation feels unearned without prior setup or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing closure where ancient shadows become power sources for a new dawn, with visible cost in the transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as fragmented radio frequencies gradually cohere into rebellion narrative. However, the who/where/when anchoring remains abstract throughout, and the conceptual cost lacks the visceral weight needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with density increasing through the collection of sounds in jars, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the child receives the ancestral lullaby. The cost is felt through the poet's "lonesome splendor" transforming into "shared hymn," with clear before/after legibility. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical transition between finding the music box and beginning the jar collection method.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (key → frequency matching → vault opening → securing artifact) with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara achieves protection through "soulful science." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—the "storm-born seekers" threat never materializes on-page, weakening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost. The story asserts transformation ("Elara felt her chest expand, the impatient fire inside her cooling") without dramatizing what she sacrifices or loses. No concrete before/after change is legible; the "patient revolution" remains abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the valve discovery, but the closure lacks decisive change with visible cost—water is redirected but no path is foreclosed with felt consequence. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the valve turn but the "collective gratitude" and "breaking free from shadow" feel asserted rather than dramatized with specific cost on page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the clockwork heart beats, reweighting the redemption metaphor with visible transformation. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery of mechanical/spiritual repair. Deduction for the slightly overwrought repetition of "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" and some causality softness in how quickly the repair succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-rich description building toward the bell-ringing, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration—Mara simply continues onward with a new objective (the prism). The "yearning algorithm's satisfaction" and "irreverent awe" don't manifest as visible cost or transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established adequately through the glider, workshop, and acid sea.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal chain from archive entry through metadata discovery to final revelation, with the recurring numbers serving as persistent constraint. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lia transforms absence into presence, with clear cost in perpetuating deception. Minor orientation wobble around "vaulted archives" physical/digital duality early on.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the crystal's reconstitution as closure, but the transformation lacks visible cost—the orchard blooms and the world breathes in unison without sacrifice or trade-off. The orientation anchors (lighthouse orchard, ice floes) arrive promptly, yet the magical resolution feels unearned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the narrator's realization that "solace is not the absence of endings, but the gentle acceptance of their approach" - a genuine conceptual repricing with emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building through repeated imagery (fold in patience, windborne solace). Minor deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the marina setting.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the accumulative texture builds toward the sentinel feeling "whole," there's no visible cost or foreclosed path - he simply achieves understanding without sacrifice. The piece lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration; the sentinel's realization that his "destiny seemed mismatched with the rolling hills" retroactively explains rather than dramatizes transformation. Orientation remains vague (when/where is this vineyard?).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - the Keeper's final departure "ready to consecrate each new clearing" crystallizes his purpose with legible stakes. However, the accumulative build lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully charge this ending. The prophet's arrival and teaching occur too smoothly, without the friction needed to make the Keeper's final stance feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through collective healing, but the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern accumulation toward communal restoration. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's understanding transforms. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt - she gains knowledge without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed options. The pattern accumulation works but lacks the sharp pressure that would elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the prophet realizes "to capture the sound of aging was not to trap it, but to let it ripple outward"—a genuine shift with conceptual cost. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring tide/echo imagery, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation of chaotic spin into "steady power," the cost remains conceptual rather than felt or visible on the page. The accumulative pattern builds through "luminous ache" repetitions and leaf-sound motifs, but the closure lacks concrete stakes—what was risked, what was lost, what price was paid beyond metaphorical "weight of centuries lifting."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Mr. Harlan's death happens passively without Mara making a choice that forecloses options. The ending disperses into abstract imagery ("every life she touched would forever hum inside the clouds") rather than crystallizing into a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The "flawless goodbye" is executed but never tested against complication or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through "closing loops" that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing—shadows revealed as entities migrating to the isle's core. However, the cost remains abstract (no clear sacrifice or foreclosed path), and the orientation arrives late with "floating isle" not anchored until line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with dense imagery building toward Mara's healing act, but the closure lacks decisive change with visible cost. The "restoration" happens without meaningful resistance or price—the tooth simply works, and Mara succeeds without sacrifice or transformation that would create a true before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the protagonist becomes "keeper of luminous peace" - but the cost remains abstract. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (glass, pearl, light) yet lacks a decisive moment where something is genuinely lost or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira transforming the data center into a healing archive, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden becomes a "living archive, preserving pain as gentle knowledge." However, the transformation lacks visible cost—Lira places stones and activates an interface without sacrifice or trade-off, and the healing happens too smoothly without earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres as the novelist collects "shapes of different hopes" through cameo encounters, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as perpetual seeker "swimming against the current." The cost is legible in "feeling the story settle into a calm that resonated like the sea after a storm"—she has bound these hopes knowing she'll always return to this difficult work.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's successful restoration of the valley's sacred practices, with visible cost in her binding vow ("laying the vine tendril back upon its stone cradle as an offering"). The accumulative structure coheres as golden threads spiral outward, building to the harvest moon's blessing. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the alchemist commits to seasonal return, but the cost remains abstract ("patient endurance"). The accumulative lens holds but lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to create meaningful escalation. Who/where/when anchors arrive clearly, but the covenant's stakes never face concrete test beyond the initial ritual's success.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward the echo-harvest, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending merely extends the pattern ("continued his work") without reconfiguration or price paid. While the crystal-tooth replacement creates a functional turn, no path is foreclosed and no meaningful cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through mineral veins calcifying and weights collecting into a "feather of balance." The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration as the grotto transforms from burden-holder to art-space, but the cost remains abstract—we see the process but not what the weaver sacrifices or risks in this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the carving process, crystallizing in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the completed lantern transforms grief into guidance. The closure lands with felt cost as Mara accepts loss as tool rather than trap. However, the cost could be more visceral—the emotional price reads more as philosophical acceptance than dramatized struggle, and some causality feels convenient (the sap crystallization process).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (collected story fragments) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts her eroded state while finding new purpose. The closure lands with visible emotional cost (tears) and conceptual repricing (carrying stories forward despite erosion), though the ghost negotiation mechanism feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the terminal resurrects and becomes a beacon, but causality wobbles—the sextant's alignment with voltage flow lacks credible mechanics. The closure lands with conceptual cost (transforming fleeting joy into lasting framework) but the "how" of power restoration through angle calibration strains believability.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the scribe completes his memory-counting clock, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than visceral. The phrase "excruciatingly gentle" repeats five times without evolving meaning, creating pattern without progression. The accumulative lens holds but lacks the density increase or cadence shift that would elevate the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagery building toward revelation, but closure lacks visible cost—the seeker gains understanding without sacrificing anything concrete. The lock-opening creates forward movement but the "architecture of lies" crumbling reads as abstract assertion rather than dramatized consequence with price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the master weaver's spiral signals readiness to share knowledge, with the collector's ongoing vigil as Earned Stasis. Yet the cost remains largely conceptual—"weight of centuries settle upon his shoulders"—rather than viscerally felt, and the accumulative pattern could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when "the garden's shadows receded" and the traveler finds "quiet hope," but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The accumulative structure builds through whispered stories and projected narratives, yet the closure's "promise that the geography of healing would always have a guide" feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized pressure. Who/where/when anchors are present but impressionistic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the phoenix's awakening that transforms the mechanical world, but the causality feels convenient—the egg simply appears and works perfectly. The closure lands with thematic weight but lacks earned dramatic cost since the prince faces no meaningful obstacles or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the ritual's completion and the lagoon's transformation into sanctuary, with visible cost in Mira's scarred fingertips and the effort of the graft. The accumulative structure builds effectively through water/fire imagery toward the closing hymn metaphor. The piece loses some causality in how exactly the coin's song transforms the villagers' hearts—this mystical leap weakens the otherwise grounded emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based progression through symbols and breadcrumbs leading to closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as memories are liberated and the city transforms from forgotten to remembered, with visible cost in Mara's pledge to guard and scatter the memories. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines with "The city of forgotten fountains" and "Mara" as protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the gear seeds "future dawns" in the garden's soil, with visible transformation as "a slender filament of light rose." The accumulative structure coheres through pattern repetition (sonar pinging, falling petals, generational echoes). However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we understand the weight of "forgotten wars" and fire's absence intellectually but don't experience the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres as ribbons unfurl, butterflies migrate, and stones spiral toward the final heart-shaped configuration. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the greenhouse transforms into a sanctuary where "stone, ribbon, poem, and spirit entwined." The cost appears in villagers' shared mourning and the water gliding over the "ribbon-etched heart," though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. Mara repairs the clock and commits to future repairs, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The pendulum resuming its swing represents restoration rather than transformation. The piece reads more as extended description of a repair ritual than a story with stakes that tighten toward resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where intentions are revealed as "not a weapon but a seed," with the gardener's understanding creating a resonant reconfiguration. The accumulative structure builds through tapestry revelations and the sovereign case's transformative properties, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from commission through modeling to implementation, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartographer embraces ignorance as creative canvas. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual ("humbled by his own ignorance") rather than viscerally felt, and the transformation of the kingdom reads as summary rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: dust particles literally trace music through the air, fulfilling Mara's desire while the city's story famine ends. Cost registers through "three years" of silence and the implicit price of piracy. The accumulative structure coheres as each luminous detail builds toward the transformation, though the midpoint broadcast arrival could tighten causally.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern-building through powder, mask shards, and gallery atmosphere. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the crystallized emotion "forever etched in stone," but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we don't see what the protagonist sacrifices or how this changes her options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Story operates under Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered metaphors (sediment/memory, cog/time) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where competing narratives merge into "complementary verses." The cost is legible in accepting paradox over singular truth. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively within first 120 words despite the unusual setting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's transformation via music, but the cost remains abstract—"hatred rusting away" lacks concrete dramatization. Causality weakens when the zither playing instantly dissolves old grudges without showing the actual friction of change. The closure lands conceptually but without visible struggle or sacrifice that would ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the greenhouse transforms from scar to beacon, with visible cost in the pruning of "old ideologies" and the city's forgotten memories being rewoven. The accumulative structure builds density effectively through layered sensory details and the knowledge fruit's transformation, though the final "proof that even in ruins" line edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the echo revelation serving as Conceptual Repricing that reweights the tower's purpose and the hive failure's meaning. Closure lands with felt cost—the city's wound transforms into renewal through Mara's truth-telling. The riddle-to-key-to-drone sequence maintains causality, though the matchbox's sudden appearance lacks earlier grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the hush gradually spreading through objects and houses, creating a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands as the narrator understands their role in catalyzing subtle shifts, though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The orientation anchors (pier at dawn, perfumer's shop) arrive clearly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through cascading revelations and pattern repetition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the garden accepts nuance. Cost appears conceptually (ossified certainty softening) but lacks visible price—no clear sacrifice or foreclosed path. The structural weakness serves as mechanism but doesn't constrain tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aric transforms the staircase from prison to laboratory, with the chipped die finally landing scarred-side-up as proof that imperfection enables perpetual motion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mathematical attempts build toward this conceptual repricing. Cost is visible in "years sketching equations" and the acceptance of permanent flaw, though the transformation feels slightly too neat in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered imagery of moon, paint, and lost languages, culminating in Jiro's recognition moment that validates Mara's purpose. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "strangers, in turn, remembered the quiet power of a single kind gesture," though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases from individual bread-baking to collective artistic revival, with the emerald lens refracting hope. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as displaced persons find home through revived arts, with cost visible in "bittersweet acceptance." Orientation anchors grotto city and waterfall setting early, though causality between bread ritual and amphitheater doors opening feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (arrival → discovery → decoding → activation) with a legible Decisive Change when the lighthouse blazes to life. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the clock maker simply succeeds and vanishes, with no price paid or path foreclosed. The orientation is solid but the "stepping beyond fate" remains abstract without concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Charged Poise closure where Mara faces the advisor's final bargain, but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. The accumulative pattern of "lingering luminance" and "photographically cursed" repetitions creates texture but the causality between fear's dissolution and the final choice lacks clear linkage. Who/where/when anchors establish adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from individual strikes to orchestral harmony, with the orchard responding as "one restless, harmonious engine." The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the prophet departs to spread his method, with implied cost in his solitary mission. The lens holds consistently though the ending's expansion to "distant isles" slightly dilutes the immediate scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-discovery driving escalation through mosaic crack, hidden passage, and light-language revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira realizes the expedition "became part of the pattern" with visible cost (the city's isolation). The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt, and the final vow to "keep listening, forever" lacks the weight of dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure ("noble lie dissolve...as a transformation into transparent honesty") lands with thematic weight but lacks visible on-page cost - Arlen smiles and walks away unscathed. The accumulative lens holds but the transformation feels declared rather than dramatically earned through concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    This reads as Accumulative/Textural with density increase toward the ending, but closure lacks decisive change or clear cost—Mara simply promises to return and continue her work. The piece teaches its lyric pattern of cataloguing and inscription but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (discovery → hypothesis → validation → action) but the closure lacks visible cost—Mara simply emerges successful without sacrifice or transformation. The revelation about architects deliberately sinking the city to protect knowledge arrives without sufficient setup, feeling more like convenient resolution than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward the ending, but closure lacks decisive change or clear cost—the lantern maker simply continues his cycle. The final image of "ascending while descending" provides resonance but no legible before/after shift or foreclosed path, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where "unused potential" shifts from external pool to internal state of being, with felt cost in the protagonist's transformation through grief. The accumulative structure coheres through crystal/resonance imagery building to the final constellation image, though the midpoint could strengthen the pressure-to-revelation bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (pilgrim arrives → Lira decodes → frequency unlocked), but the closure lacks visible cost. The resolution arrives through mechanical action (pulling lever, pressing chip) without meaningful trade-off or sacrifice. The "missing pieces" snap into place too easily, undermining the earned transformation required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver clear closure with visible cost. The ending declares resolution ("the weight of that withheld truth had finally been lifted") without dramatizing what specific truth was discovered or what price the protagonist pays for this knowledge. The carved phrase about truth being "heavier than any crown" attempts Conceptual Repricing but remains abstract platitude rather than earned revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are adequately established early.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves closure through Earned Stasis—the negotiator releases prisoners and departs with renewed wisdom, foreclosing his past pattern of failure. The causal lens holds as past error motivates present caution, but the cost remains abstract ("weight lift," "conscience finally at peace") rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward emotional resolution, but the closure lacks visible cost on the page. The navigator reaches acceptance through paddling and reflection, yet no specific path is foreclosed, no price paid—just abstract promises to the wind. The "when expectations collapse" backstory fragment consumes ~20% without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist tosses the baseball and embraces the labyrinth as "compass rather than chain," with emotional cost visible in accepting "the weight of its sorrow." The accumulative structure coheres through water imagery and light/dark motifs, though the "synthetic neural reset" setup creates mild orientation confusion about whether memories remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora's transformation and reunion with Arion, but the cost remains abstract—"reluctant metamorphosis" and "bark patterns" don't translate to felt consequence on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds but lacks the density shifts or pattern breaks that would elevate pressure toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a clear closure with visible cost—the twins simply sleep peacefully after receiving reclaimed time, but no price is paid or path foreclosed. The accumulative pattern builds atmosphere but never coheres into a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The cartomancer "vanishes into clouds" without transformation or consequence that reweights the opening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Nara opens the locked dimension and transforms it from sealed grief into "a garden of possibilities," with clear cost in leaving the ship forever. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (tear, shimmer, stitching), but the mechanics of how stitching actually opens dimensions remains vague, weakening the closure's causal foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the fireflies' release and Mara's understanding that "transformation was not a single event but a texture," but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: small observations build into a reweighted final stance. Orientation is immediate (storm‑damaged greenhouse, after the flood), and the piece compresses time legibly. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she leaves with a new credo about tiny disturbances—with a quiet cost of renouncing grand drama. The causal line is soft but coherent within the accumulative design; no beats contradict the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds (frost → crevice → mine → shards → kiln) to a resonant reconfiguration where the glass’s song reframes loss. Causal links are soft but coherent; orientation is clean from the first lines. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (workshop scorched, risked trek) and a reweighted meaning (purpose in pauses). The decisive change is quiet yet legible through the kiln’s charged reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean single‑scene structure with an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when the conservatory “exhales” into song. Orientation is immediate (conservatory, survivor, tuning fork, broken clock), and set‑ups pay off (device mechanics, final chord). Cost is felt as an earned stasis/acceptance—she chooses to live by the song rather than erase the storm. Stakes are contained but coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pulses of light build toward a reweighted world where the library becomes sanctuary. Orientation is clear early (underwater library, dock, package, lens) and the closure lands with a visible price (Marlow merges with the light). Causal links (assemble lens → pulses → spirits settle) are legible without mechanical plotting. The piece avoids outline-y “and then” and keeps one coherent stake through to a resonant cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the bell’s recurring act and the quiet cadence build to a Charged Poise closure where hope is reweighted against risk. Orientation is solid: who/where/when and the dominant stake are clear early. Closure lands in the final image (bell in moonlight; renewed runs) with a felt cost implied by secrecy and sanctions, though no single decisive turn tightens options on the page. The structure holds as a continuous shard without causality breaks, if a touch static.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres from lens alignment to tunnel to release, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (unused love becomes a flowing current). Orientation is clean early; causality is lyrical but traceable via breath mechanics. Cost is soft (the tear dims; no explicit sacrifice), which limits the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece layers images (halo fragment, hyperbolic corridors, fading photographs) until the dusk closure reweights meaning. The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the maze completes, photographs vanish, and time’s “texture” is felt. Cost is present but conceptual—loss of photographs as they dissolve—which keeps the closure effective but gentle. Orientation is steady early: who/where/what is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear causal chain: decode bench → stair → inscription → arrow key → vault → planting. Closure lands on the page (seed sprouts; chains slacken), but the cost is lightly felt—guardians and danger remain mostly hypothetical. The lens reads Causal and holds, though obstacles don’t meaningfully bite. Still, the progression is coherent and clean with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece orients quickly (who/where/what) and builds meaning through repeated acts (forge work, color‑tones, “absences”) until the final chord reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the device hums a full chord and Mara internalizes the orchard’s memory, with conceptual cost (bearing collected grief). The linkage is coherent across beats, if gently escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: flower code → jar opens → map → jade door → lantern ignition → revaluation of purpose. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the thief reframes “stealing” into preservation, with the station transformed into a haven. Orientation is strong early (emerald station, conductor, jar), and the lens holds Hybrid leaning accumulative/causal. The on‑page price is soft (identity shift rather than a concrete loss), but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: present-tense craft accrues into a charged final image (panels flicker; bookmark as compass). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with the cost of patience and relinquished control implied, if a bit abstract. Structural tightening occurs at the “abandon” beat and carries to the dusk activation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: seashell → cipher → lever threat → panel → vial with price → acceptance and reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why tonight), and each step narrows options or raises stakes. Closure lands with a decisive choice carrying conceptual cost (betraying the hidden self), reinforced by the constellations re-spelling her name. Slight convenience in the swift appearance of the mythic vial, but it pays off the established chain.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm, single star, and hush concentrate into a closure where the map is sealed in breath and then dissolves—Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis lands. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern is taught early (retell by summarizing silence) and paid off. Cost is legible but conceptual—the map’s dissolution and the star’s loss—enough at this length. A slightly stronger causal tightening would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of images and the melting clock build to a conceptual repricing—cleaning becomes creation and thought’s source is partly traced. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when; after the program in a frozen courtyard). Closure lands on the page with cost (the violin’s dissolution, memory fragment stored), even if the price is quiet. The beat sequence is coherent and culminates in a reweighted final image (chimes, aurora, empty stand).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions accrue from tickets → lens → backstage → public projection → dawn repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of the city’s discourse, with Mara’s role reframed. Cost is mostly conceptual (foregoing accusation‑based adjudication), not strongly dramatized. Orientation is clear and the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished marble intensifies response (humming, pathways, oak, clearing), culminating in the garden’s voiced acknowledgment and crowning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (bearing the weight of bloom and rot) on the page. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the pattern is taught early then paid off. While stakes aren’t dire, the cadence deepens and lands decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Held under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the sequence coheres: lever → intensification → flora unfurl → recorded proof. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—time can be nudged sideways—articulated on the page with a charged final image. Cost is soft (an “icy warmth” permeating the station), so consequence feels more atmospheric than pressurized. Orientation is excellent from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration shifting from “notes” to “silences” as the code, with a cadence shift when the lanterns steady and the program dries. Orientation is clean early (flooded opera house, violinist in pit, antique program) and the throughline stays coherent. The causal chain is lyrical but legible: patterns → alignment → sustained note → revelation → final chord. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional—risk to calm and instrument—credible but not heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece tightens through the pattern of smudges → barometer adjustment → stabilized reading, culminating in a reweighted final image. Orientation is immediate (oracle, mountain station, dawn, post-fever) and single-scene coherence holds. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—truth given a measurable number—and the cost is felt if quiet. The price is largely emotional and conceptual, not materially constraining, which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: soundscapes, radio fragments, and the wheel’s oscillation gather into a pattern culminating in an Earned Stasis choice. Orientation is clean early (tunnel, Mara, target object), and the numeric-pattern beat acts as the tightening. Cost is legible in the refusal to act and the pressure “settling into his ribs.” The causality is lyric but coherent; a touch more consequence beyond internal pressure could raise impact.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the descent, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as he accepts his function. Orientation is strong from the outset (catacombs, keeper, library). Closure lands on the page: he enters the refuge, dissolves, writes the line, and returns with a changed stance. The cost is felt conceptually (eroded thought, fleeting peace) rather than dramatized as a concrete loss, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: eclipse approaches, music accrues, communal reconfiguration lands. Orientation is clean and the closure image (closing the locket, vow, village tradition) reads as a resonant reconfiguration. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt, and causality never tightens beyond inevitable eclipse timing. The outcome is assured once she starts playing, limiting structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Beats accrete cleanly (humming → vibration → conduit → vaulted chamber → activation) to a Conceptual Repricing: the “displaced axis” reframed as “realignment.” Cost is primarily conceptual—the hum as “last sigh of humanity’s collective dream”—felt but gentle. The single-scene coherence and on-page activation secure closure without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece builds through patterned images (beam, spiral, mist) to a reweighted dawn image. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise—the world subtly rewired by released “open secrets.” Causality is soft but coherent: specs → method → first cookie → cache → broadcast. The cost at closure is mostly conceptual, not felt, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density tightens: looping sound, indigo, and silence build to the final chord that shatters stillness and steadies the anchor (a clear closure beat). Orientation holds from the outset; single scene and stake remain coherent. The conceptual price is present but light—his threatened consumption never bites on‑page—tempering the peak. Still, the before/after reconfiguration reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: sensory density and ritualized actions build to a charged poise/CR where the lake sings and her role reconfigures. Orientation is clean early (glass spire, dawn, frozen lake, single POV), and the beats escalate from alignment to activation. Closure is on‑page, but cost is conceptual rather than sharply felt, keeping it just below the top band. The pattern taught (object + horizon + sound) pays off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts all timelines, the tablet dissolves, and he “fell upward,” reweighting meaning with a conceptual cost. The scene holds as a single window with clear orientation and one cadence-tightening (the algorithm rendering a final corridor). Cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a taught pattern of reversed songs → mirrored hush → forward play yields a clear reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the closure occurs on the page as the filament brightens with her revived heartbeat. Cost is subtle but legible in the pressure of confronting silence and stretching the filament. The final seasonal return pays off the pattern without breaking scope.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: quarantine constrains options; the tube appears; the lateral passage offers a plausible tactic; the final charged poise lands in her realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a concrete act (slipping the tube) and a conceptual cost (embracing isolation and risk over direct confrontation). Orientation is clear early and maintained. The cost is subtle rather than sharply felt, keeping it short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density of sensory signs escalates toward a resonant reconfiguration: the ultraviolet tracing of perfume molecules leads to a vow and a reweighted understanding of grief. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what). Closure lands on the page with a felt cost (acceptance of ongoing sorrow and the burden of cataloging). The beat sequence is coherent even without overt antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterning and density tighten toward a clear closure: binding the rope to the stone. The cost is on the page (foreclosing one path of memory), and the lens holds without contradiction. The pressure is more tonal than obstacle‑driven, but causal continuity of actions (trace pattern → uncover layers → confront final fork) reads clean. A single, decisive cadence shift at the end provides adequate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: music + story + bowl build density until the hush reconfigures into a hum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when the hush is “unbound” and the orchard “breathes.” Cost is felt conceptually (accepting the unfinished) rather than dramatized as loss. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the single scene sustains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual intensifies to a completion chime, then reweights with the courier’s crate, yielding a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean from the first line. The cost is conceptual—empathy commodified—rather than concretely felt, which softens impact. Still, the cadence shift from ritual completion to new demand lands.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal links (misdelivered envelope → visit → balcony gesture → communal reading). Orientation is clean and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of community attention, though the cost is conceptual more than felt. The beats cohere, but tension stays low and obstacles are minimal. Ending image returns seeded objects effectively but without a hard turn.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation and coherence hold cleanly; the piece builds pattern density (orchard ache, glyph, weaving) toward a conceptual repricing that the tag is “a living symbol.” Closure lands through the vow and the community’s ongoing lattice, though the cost is soft and largely conceptual (duty to sustain connection). The two‑shard feel (trek to glyph → communal weaving/epilogue) is smooth and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (“interrupted cadence,” pendant pulses) accrete into a on‑page closure with cost (sacrifice of the pendant, rhythm restored). Orientation is strong from the outset; the turn to the light‑bridge and descent to the cavern escalates within the pattern. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis, legible and thematically linked. Minor softness in causal pressure, but no breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions build to a conceptual repricing where loss becomes transformation, sealed by the petal‑rain and dawn. Orientation is strong from the first lines; single scene coherence is clean. Closure is present but soft on cost—the price is acceptance rather than a felt loss. The progression (eyes → numbers → equation → petals) tracks and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story tightens from discovery → assembly → emanation → emergence, culminating in a Charged Poise/RR as Maren becomes visible. Orientation is clean and the closure image is on‑page, but the cost is soft—exposure is suggested rather than felt. Strong motif carry‑through helps the cadence shift land despite low resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm → coil → mycelial contact → chlorophyll unfurling → greenhouse echo. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where he commits to a practice and the world’s pattern answers in chorus. Causal links are soft but coherent; the on‑page cost is conceptual (surrender of control) rather than dramatized sacrifice. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens or timeline confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: rain trail → brooch → exchange → convergence/aftermath. Orientation is strong and the closure lands with a visible cost (surrendered canvases) and reconfigured options (renewal, preservation on cliffs). The brooch’s sudden “voice” is a slight convenience but doesn’t break the chain. The final cadence returns to studio with a charged object, completing the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the pilgrim’s arrival intensifies the cave’s response, leading to a resonant reconfiguration where Lira reframes destiny. Orientation is early and stable; cause/effect is dreamlike but coherent within the taught rules. Closure lands as conceptual repricing with the “bright darkness” invitation, though cost is soft. The mosaic beats (pilgrim, pearl tear, child, return) cohere under one lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pattern of calling, collecting, and communal response culminates in the charged pivot to depart for a deeper legend. Orientation is clean early; the valve anchors structure and returns at closure. The cost is mostly conceptual—leaving the harbor, taking on the trench—which keeps the closure resonant but soft. One meaningful tightening arrives with the night gathering → sunrise chord → summons → embark.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via a sequence of thresholds (cracks → doorway → vault → staircase → iron door → ledger). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the fortress is a living archive and she commits to ongoing stewardship. Causality holds with clear because/therefore links, though resistance is minimal. Cost is present but soft, anchored in the vow and implied life-shift rather than a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of pattern and motif builds toward the tile settling “into a perfect square of calm,” a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (tower at cliff; Lira; night mission), and all beats cohere within one scene. Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after (restless inquiry to kept sanctuary), though the on‑page cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The through‑line (transcription → stanza completion → sanctuary vow) is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, imagery and motifs (“hushed thunder,” magnetic fields) escalate to a conceptual repricing: goodbye as pivot rather than end. Orientation is clear early (immortal, crystalline cavern, solar storm) and the pattern is taught and kept. The closure lands on page—he renounces emptiness and exits—though the cost is quiet. A slightly firmer causal hinge at the “Will you stay?” beat could heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres—waiting intensifies grief-density, the ink ignites, a contract manifests, and an off-page opening by officials completes a Conceptual Repricing (asylum reframed as covenant). Orientation is clean, but the decisive effect arrives with little on-page price and leans on an off‑stage bureaucratic collapse, softening closure’s felt cost. Still, the before/after is legible and motivated by the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions layer toward a conceptual repricing at sunrise. Orientation is clean early (mountaintop bonsai labyrinth, silent town, stationer’s task). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: his craft becomes a bridge, and he recommits with endurance. Cost is implied (solitude/perseverance) rather than concretely tested, keeping it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered fragments → label → numbers → murals → conceptual repricing of the narrator’s role. Orientation is anchored early (port, containers, tides) and the rule-set (label as filter) emerges cleanly through action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator commits to archiving, with a conceptual cost (remaining erased to serve the erased). The cost remains soft and internal, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: hum → pointing shell → ledger → chord → reweighted understanding. Orientation is clean (who/where/what). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the compass is an evolving melody and the “answer” is retelling. Cost is underplayed; discovery proceeds smoothly without a felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a causal lens, beats connect cleanly: task → discovery of chip → graffiti network → reorganization → investors arrive → council postpones privatization. Closure lands on the page (postponement and living map) with a modest cost (ongoing fight, secrecy, divided loyalty). The sequence is legible and purposeful, but key turns happen in summary rather than a pressure scene, muting impact. No orientation or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: preparation → countdown → shutter → elegiac descent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—the act of capturing and packing the canister forecloses further questing and carries a felt cost (“tremor of grief”). Orientation is crisp from the outset and the chemical trigger cleanly anchors the decisive beat. The stakes never fracture, and no causality gaps appear.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: image density builds toward a quiet Charged Poise—repair complete, data noted, future iterations implied. Orientation is solid, and the throughline (repair under a soft ticking clock) is coherent. Closure lands, but the on‑page cost is modest, more a vow of ongoing labor than a decisive price. One tighter constriction or failed attempt would have heightened the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate, and the sequence tightens from deciphering condensation → aligning the transmitter → sending the signal → first trickle of thaw. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the vein of water and tolling bell reweight the stakes with an implied cost (unleashing forces she can’t control). The price is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from solitary ritual to communal arrival, landing in a resonant reconfiguration as he departs and the town hums without him. Orientation is clean early (archway at sunrise, empty plaza, tuner with fork). Causality is lyric but coherent: sunrise as consent → fork hum → imagined steps → material restoration → workers’ steps echo. Cost is subtle—his endurance and erasure—yet legible on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and a causal spine: the temple’s price leads to the beacon’s sacrifice, which reweights the final release. Closure lands with cost (forgoing rescue) and a conceptual repricing (turning private survival into shared “hush”). Orientation is solid early; the scene maintains a single throughline. Minor causal blurs (vial movement, magical fiat of fish glyphs) don’t undermine the core beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterns (copperlight, hush, lattice) accrete toward a resonant reconfiguration where the boy reframes warning into guidance. Causality is legible (lattice prompts → map → reef), and the single scene coheres. Cost at closure is soft (cold salt, risk implied, reputational shift) rather than biting. The final image lands, though the “beacon of truth” flourish edges toward tell.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of pass-through awakenings tightens toward the decisive final act where love is transmuted to venom; cost is on‑page in her fading and the bead’s residuum. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the piece holds its taught cadence to a charged final image. Minor diffuseness of external stakes prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: recurring acts (sleepwalking, sewing light) build toward a reconfigured labyrinth and a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (rule-breaking reweighted into communal reverence). However, tangible cost or constraint at the end is implied more than felt on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single continuous exploration culminating in the altar’s completion and a voice of thanks—an on‑page reconfiguration from fractured to mended. Orientation is crisp from the first lines. Cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt; the scene doesn’t dramatize a sacrifice beyond patience and responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual details build toward the activation and launch, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise when the letter departs encoded and identity is mailed as concept, though cost is light. The because/therefore chain is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via pattern synchronization, leading to the charged completion and dispatch of the chart. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; single POV and one scene hold. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map exits, the ember fades, the city’s options shift. Cost is mostly conceptual (spent ember, risk assumed), not dramatized as immediate peril.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: pane → lagoon/veil escalates coherently to a charged reconfiguration. Closure is on‑page as the apology migrates from condensation to soil and the weight dissolves; the price is the relinquishment of withheld speech. Setups (shard, spirits, condensation) pay off without causality breaks. Orientation is clean and the single dominant stake stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: mist, coral, and the cast build toward a Charged Poise closure when the droplet seals the graft. Orientation is clean from the opening and the motif pattern is taught early and paid off. The cost lands conceptually (endurance, ache) without false neatness. The scene stays single‑window and honors its scale.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density of light, fog, and mural motifs builds to a resonant reconfiguration where the orchard “breathes” and the fragment dissolves. Orientation is clean from the outset (artist at dawn in a fog-bound orchard). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—art as communal light—though the on-page cost is soft and mostly implied (expenditure of energy and surrender of the fragment’s “essence”). Escalation is more tonal than causal, yet coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clear by the opening: Lena at dawn in the sound wave garden with the hobo nickel. The piece holds an accumulative/textural lens, layering echoes and images toward a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses curiosity. Causality is soft but consistent; escalations proceed via density and reprise (coin → pedestal tone → charged final image). The cost is present (comfort relinquished), though it could land with sharper on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as pressure and pattern density build toward a reconfiguration: Mirabel chooses to protect, and the network extends citywide, with the final image promising ongoing resistance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR, though the cost is mostly conceptual (risk under a thought‑tax regime) rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies toward the postcard blooming and the shell becoming a “library of light,” a resonant reconfiguration with the price of ages paid. Orientation is clean early (gargantuan shell, reef, moonless night). Closure lands on-page with the bloom and the baton pass to the child, reweighting the premise. The cost is felt conceptually more than in a sharp present-tense crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds until the traveler’s arrival breaks the pattern and reweights the stake. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—the work continues, but the world is measurably re‑tuned (hope note; softened regret) with the price of endless tending intact. Orientation is clear early (caretaker, opal library, museum frame). The causal chain is ritual → echo → preservation → traveler’s uptake → renewed ritual, coherently tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is coherent: each glyph decoded intensifies the pattern toward the covenant’s revival. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: archive reawakens, keepers emerge, she accepts the next charge, with conceptual cost (weight of covenant). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. The cost is present but soft; nothing tangible is lost or foreclosed beyond pledged obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the adhesive-to-binary-to-chain-to-valve sequence coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: the city will draw water “by conversation.” Orientation is clean early; continuity of scene and single POV hold. The closure lands, though cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt on the page. No major causal gaps, but the path contains minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of maps, glow of the chip, and the city’s hum feedback tighten toward a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the chip’s light fades as the map glows, memory’s wilt accepted. Orientation is clean and single‑POV consistent. Stakes remain interior but coherently advanced through patterned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-dense progression from terrace → seam → glass corridor → maps → charged return. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing: thresholds as moments where distance collapses into memory, reweighting his goal and lineage. Orientation is solid early; causality is associative yet coherent. The cost is implied (taking on guardianship, shedding loss) but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single scene with one tightening (firefly-lit passages to the instrument dome) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration at dawn as study becomes communion. Orientation is solid; causality follows a ritual logic. Cost at closure is soft—ephemeral knowledge kept, no sacrifice demanded—tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats stack cleanly: seeds → hues → pillars → mosaic → fissure → stitching threads that restore the bridge. Orientation is immediate and consistent, and the closure lands on‑page with the bridge’s reappearance plus a conceptual shift (“paths…awaiting the right emotional resonance”). Cost is mostly conceptual/tonal (fragility of recollection, use of the “final seed”) rather than suffered loss. The pattern taught early (hues as guidance) pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects recur (bishops, ink, tide) and pattern density builds to the violin and the tide’s erasure. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the scene remains continuous. Closure reads as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise) rather than a decisive change, with the tide washing the sign away. The felt cost is minimal, leaning more toward ephemerality than a true price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through density and cadence: discovery of the speck, learning to “slip,” and the inking ritual culminate in a thematic reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: elective exile reframed as chosen pilgrimage, and the verse carries outward. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is lyric but coherent. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, yet discernible in the surrender of isolation and the marked body.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual accrues meaning until the final image (stone pocketed; readiness to repeat) creates a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when). The closure is gentle and conceptually satisfying but the “cost” is faint—more acceptance than foreclosed path. Structure is clean and contained to a single evolving scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images of moon, ash, and fracture accrue toward the village-opening and conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean, and closure lands via the box’s transformation and the reframed meaning of the bargain. Cost is present but mostly conceptual—she relinquishes her private bargain to the collective—so the final beat resonates more than it wounds. The single-scene arc is coherent and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clean early (grotto, gauge, Arin, council charge), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as experiments mount toward a conceptual revaluation: the gauge as mirror of communal resolve. The closure lands on the page (needle at zero; festival plan; dawn confirmation), though cost is largely conceptual rather than felt. Two-shard flow (night work → next dawn) is coherent, with clear because/therefore linkages in a lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural lens is consistent: diaries → negative → wall hum → seasonal returns, culminating in a conceptual repricing of what “mapping” means. Orientation is clean from the outset and the ending image provides on‑page closure. The epilogue‑like months‑later montage sustains rather than resets the arc. The cost at closure is conceptual, not sharply felt, keeping it short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pressure builds through hush, clouds, and the delayed bell until the toll catalyzes the doors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the mirrors project possibilities. However, the cost is soft; success arrives without a felt trade‑off or foreclosed path on the page. Orientation is firm early (terrace, spring, mirrors), and the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, lucid scene builds accumulative pressure through ritual and culminates in a visible decisive act (swords on the altar). Orientation is immediate (terrace, midsummer, altar, clipboard), and the logic from writing terms to public commitment holds. Cost is legible as renunciation of grudges and arms; the closure image reweights the prior ritual. The lens stays textural/ritualistic without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual builds to an on‑page closure: the egg’s release and captured echo, followed by a brief second shard that confirms consequence. Cost is conceptual and social (his engineered drought) rather than immediate peril, but it reweights the final image credibly. Orientation is clear from the outset; cause/effect holds without teleports or patches. The cadence tightens well at the lull-to-click-to-fracture sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds from approach → untangling threads → releasing the final golden strand, culminating in a reweighted citywide chorus (RR/CR). Orientation is strong and the closure image lands, but the cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt; no concrete price is dramatized. The throughline remains coherent and contained to one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds image by image toward a conceptual repricing—strings as lifelines and a renewed ethical method. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the dome-to-exit progression is coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise/CR with the decision to “reverse the old hierarchy,” though the on-page cost is muted. No causality breaks, but pressure remains intentionally low.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is consistent: the piece intensifies through repeated knotting, the “last monarch” as clock, and the glow’s ebb at sunrise. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—when the wing is tied and the structures begin to fade, fixing a before/after with the cost of transience. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never slips. The cost is felt but modest, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual actions build to a resonant reconfiguration where the sanctum becomes a “living library.” Orientation is solid early (Mara, sanctum, organ), and the rope/cylinder mechanics read clean. Closure lands as RR, though the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than a felt sacrifice. The traveler’s coda extends the pattern without disrupting coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres from altar prep to vortex/rewriting to pact—an on‑page conceptual repricing lands. Orientation is clear early (bunker, forest, storm clock), and patterning (seal hums → vortex → etched routes) teaches itself. Cost is mostly conceptual (yielding to the forest’s will), which reads but isn’t strongly priced in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clear and linear: discovery → preparation → alignment → ritual → response. The closure lands on the page (violet glow, click), but the price of binding the unknown is more asserted than felt. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the cadence shift at the “third watch” works. A brief epilogue about prosperity is summary rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is crisp, the two‑shard structure (monks → wanderer) holds, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is soft but coherent: night’s porous walls → tactile activation → emotional rewiring. The cost is conceptual (surrendering resentment) rather than dramatized as a hard trade‑off. The reprise with the wanderer solidifies the rule‑set without overcomplicating scope.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Held under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from ritual setup to the dream’s capture and a charged poise conclusion (portal humming, sextant pointing). Causality is coherent: breathing → fog welds → dream threads to sextant → mirror takes it. Closure lands with a conceptual price (ongoing guardianship and the reconfigured boundary rule). The cost is subtle but present in his vow and anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Ribbon snag → improvisational care → ritual mend provides a clean because/therefore chain within a lyric cadence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the breach reframed as purpose, with on‑page reconfiguration (the chime, sharpened world) though the cost is largely prior and soft. Orientation is crisp early; scope holds to a single scene with one tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: inquiries dissolve, bathroom breakthroughs accrue, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when the cameo projects constellations and he accepts nonlinear inheritance with an unsettling comfort. Orientation is crisp from the opening (curator, orchard on asteroid, silent summons). The cost—surrendering linear life narrative—registers on the page and reweights prior beats. Tight patterning from orchard ↔ bathroom pays off cleanly in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: mapping gaps → collapse to vines → linguistic lock → offering the missing page → chamber → reweighting → new portal. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: the library’s purpose realized and the future altered. Cost is present but light—she gives up a page and forecloses the gap by promising to fill it. Hybrid lens (causal with textural cadence) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: patterned objects (mirrors, card, threads) build toward a portal and a reweighted final image. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the ship revives and her mission reframes as freeing stories, not collecting objects. Causal throughline is intact (card → slot → ink river → verses → garden → ship’s revival), though the felt cost is modest. Orientation is clear early; single POV and scope fit.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when within the clock tower) and the causal chain is clean: seal → vault → rope reweaving → door dissolves → clock stops. Closure lands on the page with cost: “awaiting the next tick that would never come,” a decisive change. The lens reads Hybrid with a causal backbone and lyric accumulation; it holds through closure. Escalation is gentle, which slightly softens the felt stakes despite a firm structural throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: pressure builds through echo density and resolves as a cadence shift. Causal beats are clean (reading ice→panel→tunnel→stone→placement→hush), and closure lands with a reconfigured soundscape. Cost is soft—quiet is achieved without sacrifice beyond the beings’ departure. Orientation is strong and the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual → rekindling → travelers → caravan → vow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (from private keeping to communal mission) but cost is soft. Orientation is clear early (custodian, pavilion, beacon) and causal threads are coherent. Coincidence aids rather than complicates, which lowers pressure but not legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm → whisper → measurement → resonance → reweighted realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the hush becomes companion and the conjecture reframes memory as light-geometry, with conceptual cost (accepting identity as collage). Orientation is clean early; the single-scene window and cadence shift are controlled. Stakes remain abstract, but the on-page cadence tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: chants, objects, and environment densify until the mosaic reveals and the fireworks reweight the night’s blankness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (hope re‑priced; note glows tying chant, fire, and fortress), with a credible ongoing price in continued labor. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Cost isn’t sharply dramatized, keeping the ceiling below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: observations accrete until the cicada’s glow and the leaders’ softened tones reweight the moment. Orientation is strong from the outset; pattern is taught and held. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (pride loosening; her epistemology repriced). The cost is subtle, not stinging, which keeps this below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the hour of inverted gravity, the trellis platforms, and the doll’s filaments gather toward a reweighted ending. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Lio’s practice of limiting exposure carries a cost (ephemeral filaments dissolve) and recharges bunker life with a new hum. Orientation is crisp early, and set-ups (time limit, doll’s function) pay off. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic, but it lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a steady density build (amber bloom → tiny storm → cascade) culminates in docking and the vial’s emptiness. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: mission fulfilled at the cost of the vial’s spent purpose and her internal expenditure. Orientation is clean and single-scene. Cost is felt, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine: murals → sigil → corridor → stair → throne; closure is on‑page when the throne accepts her. Orientation is crisp early, and the quest completes cleanly. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, which mutes the decisive beat’s weight. No turns threaten the outcome; the clock doesn’t materially constrict tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated ritual action builds to a threshold opening and a conceptual reweighting (“barrier” becomes “bridge”). Closure is on-page with cost: he burns bridges, forecloses retreat, and leaves the ring. Orientation (who/where/what) is established early and remains coherent. The causal thread is modest but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative tilt: the texts, Lira’s nudge, and the chamber sequence build to a conceptual repricing where pressure’s tangibility conditions the diamonds’ endurance. Orientation is strong early; causal beats (accept → install → pressurize → crystallize) are coherent. Closure lands with the explicit warning about conditional diamonds and the vow to safeguard the glow, though the price is more conceptual than visceral. The throughline holds, with one meaningful tightening at the chamber activation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the causal chain is clean: crank → sound → map‑like vibrations → panel → floorboard → scroll → revaluation. Closure is present via a discovery and conceptual repricing of the dynasty’s fall. The lens reads Hybrid, dominated by causal linkage with a lyric cadence at the end. Cost is mostly conceptual, not materially felt, keeping it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (ritual activation, choreographed glyphs, vapor stages) and lands a Conceptual Repricing/RR: loyalty redefined as song, the self bound to the orchard. Cost is on-page (self-submergence; foreclosing solitary quest). Orientation is clear and the single-scene arc coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the button-light-dust method accrues meaning and culminates in a charged poise ending. Orientation is clean early (file room, archivist, object), and the two-shard structure (night/next morning) is coherent. Closure lands via resonance—she commits to the work with a visible cost (remaining broken-hearted) and a reweighted rule-set (the room as an archive that can be read). Causality within the magical logic stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is coherent and largely causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: puddle‑map → platform → key → broadcast → city reaction. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—truth goes public and memory is reweighted. The cost is gestured (endurance of a long battle) rather than dramatized in-scene. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds through the final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern builds from emergence to whisper to dissolution, with closure in the valley spared and his quiet departure. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure unit lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a world kept intact through a chosen hush. Cost is implied (self-effacement, burden of vigilance) rather than dramatized, which lowers the ceiling. Still, the on-page act (whisper refracted, code erased) ties cause and effect coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the density of ritual and signs intensifies toward the charged final act of placing a leaf and sealing a pact. Orientation is clean early (Lira, arbor, hush), and setups (moonstone dust, monuments) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: human care binds with forest memory, though the cost is conceptual and gentle. The causal thread is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is coherent and causal under an Accumulative/Textural lens: compass → greenhouse test → waterfall → fissure → brazier → inscription → return. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she reframes her craft and future decisions around uncertainty. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the renunciation of certainty is legible in the final image (waterfall-clock, offering the compass as lesson). Orientation is clean early, single POV sustained, and setup images recur with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene, single POV, and an accumulative/textural drive culminate in a resonant reconfiguration: the coin’s seam sealed and the internal stance subtly reweighted. Orientation is clean early; the causal chain—naming → tremor → gold seam—tracks. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (accepting the search party’s loss, testing limits), which lands softly but coherently. A hair more on‑page resistance or consequence would deepen the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via sound and image until the joke catalyzes a tangible turn: confessions reconfigure into “stories of redemption,” and the tooth becomes a beacon. Orientation is clean from the opening; the scene honors single-POV and scope limits. The closure lands on-page with a felt cost (opening herself to grief, then relinquishing the charged tooth to the altar), though the price is gentle. Causality is soft but coherent: harp → pursuit → coaxing → laughter → transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues through repeated flashes and culminates in the clearing and final surge. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis—the world reweights when mercy is redefined and the strap’s meaning flips with visible cost. Orientation is clean early (post‑anesthesia in the ultraviolet forest). The causal rhythm (price per revelation) remains coherent with no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned details (gull, lantern, angles) converge to trigger the chain’s unfastening and the fragment’s release, achieving on‑page closure. The cost is present in surrendering a charged heirloom and assuming the beacon role. Causality holds within the taught magical logic, and the final reconfiguration (personal artifact → communal memory) reads cleanly. A slightly clearer on‑page pinch of resistance would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal—each step (fissures → lantern → dust routes → hatch → hidden clock/barrel → circuit map → alcove → ledger) follows a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: acknowledgement of the ghosts and the ledger’s recovery reweight Mara’s burden into purpose. Cost is modest (risk and effort, no true sacrifice), keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is clean early, and the final image ties back to the ticking heart without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, imagery layers coherently from bottle to press to rupture to lattice, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a causal twist. Closure lands: the library is reconfigured and her printed page seals the aim, with a conceptual cost—the shattering of the “perfect system.” Orientation is clear early, pattern is taught and kept. The cost registers more conceptually than viscerally, holding back a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward the storm-time alignment and the gallery projection, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where dispute becomes collaboration. Orientation is strong from the opening, and set-ups (mirrors, storm, shard) pay off. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional—Lira reframes revolution—rather than concretely dramatized, softening the impact. The closure image (shard as compass; vow to memory) lands cleanly with charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when are clear), and the piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual actions deepen density toward a cadence shift. Closure lands with the gear’s click and the village’s warming, a Decisive Change with a conceptual after‑cost (truth now polices the covenant and Alder assumes guardianship). The causal thread is simple but coherent, with no rule‑breaking moves. Cost is light and mostly conceptual, keeping this below the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: quarry → lagoon → water staircase → crystal → vortex → repricing realization → charged return to storm. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt cost (relinquishing explanations), and the scene keeps single‑POV focus and spatial clarity. A small causality wobble occurs when the compass is swallowed yet later “held aloft,” but it doesn’t fracture closure. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: process deepens toward a conceptual repricing as the arch becomes studio and practice becomes bridge-making. Closure lands in the crafted compass and the lantern dimming—mission “fulfilled”—with a felt cadence shift. Cost is implied (time, scars, renunciation of a single-figure piece), but it’s soft, keeping the turn from fully decisive. Orientation is clean early (arch/harbor/lighthouse), and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence coheres (pavilion → cathedral → lens‑garden vision → return), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “dawning hush” reframed as promise, with her winter relinquished. Causality holds (postcard alignment triggers lenses), though the cost is soft and the mechanism verges on convenience. Orientation is crisp from the opening and carries cleanly through the single transition.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is coherent and mostly causal: letters → parley → debris‑messages → passage → lagoon/crystal → broadcast. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the ending provides on‑page closure as the broadcast reconfigures the desert. Cost at closure is conceptual more than felt, which limits punch. Still, the throughline holds and pays off cleanly under a hybrid accumulative/causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: images and motifs compound toward the town’s patient bloom and his oath to tend it. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—the town revives through remembered intention—and the bottle ends emptied, signaling price and completion. Orientation is clean from the first line. Cost is present but modest, residing in renunciation and labor rather than a sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as sound, scent, and language intensify toward a reconfiguration. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: the prophecy reinterpreted as a preservation loop and Harel’s act of sealing it. Cost is present but understated—accepting the loop and its burden rather than resisting it. Causality is coherent: phonograph → prophecy → memory bridge → realization → recording.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the vortex intensifies, the atrium transforms, and the ritual crescendos into a reweighted end where she plants the seed and internalizes the covenant. Orientation is clear from the start; the pattern is taught and sustained. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive contest, with a conceptual cost (surrendering present, borrowing future) legible though soft. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: timer → switch → zero-hour activation → dawn hush. Orientation is clean early; causal steps (glue set, sync, threshold trigger) land without gaps. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the sanctuary shifts from noise to measured listening with a conceptual price (tradition laid aside). Cost is subtle but legible in the rope’s retirement and the new, stricter threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned perception builds to a vow, the station’s sensors translate it into a ribbon, and the ground tremor answers—a resonant reconfiguration with a felt, if subtle, cost (choosing quiet endurance as purpose). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). The closure lands on the page through image and cause‑adjacent response, though the price is more atmospheric than acute. Single scene coherence and one meaningful tightening are present.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (ash world, beekeeping oasis, visible ghosts), and escalation accrues through patterning—ghosts align with the box, hum rises, tear seals covenant. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: aligning the box and sealing the covenant reconfigure stakes with the cost of chosen silence. Minor softness remains in causal tightness (no hard counterforce), but the cadence shift at the end is decisive and on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the reunited capsule/urn reweights time so clocks count “the weight of decisions,” with the valley in charged poise. Setups (garage-sale ciphers, damaged capsule) pay off cleanly through Mara’s choices; causality is coherent and pattern-taught. Cost is primarily conceptual/social rather than personal, limiting peak impact but still legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is strong from the outset; one continuous scene coheres. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he reframes “mending” as honoring the incomplete, and the final image (feather as star; woven dawns) crystallizes this. Cost is subtle but present in the renunciation of fixing; a stronger on‑page price would raise this.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as a predominantly accumulative/causal hybrid: patterned ritual → public response → council decision. Orientation is clean, and closure lands with the decree lifted (a tangible social Decisive Change). Cost is present conceptually (time pressure, continuous labor) but under-dramatized on the page, with few on‑scene obstacles or turns. The single escalation track is legible but smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one scene escalating through sound/light/rain density to a Charged Poise closure where the amber dimming and tower’s new rhythm reweight “homecoming” as dialogue. Orientation is clean and the final cadence lands; the cost sits mostly as conceptual renunciation rather than a concrete loss, keeping it shy of higher bands. Causality is pattern‑driven not plot‑turn‑driven, but consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → decoding → releasing → sprouting builds toward a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the outset (coachman on a jetty after reef death). Closure arrives in the sealing whisper and the reweighted image of the jetty as a “thin ribbon of hope.” Cost is present conceptually—the reef’s irrevocable loss—though it remains soft rather than biting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    Structure is clean: cylinder → prism‑reading → riddle → market square chest → leaf → renewed vow. The inferred lens is Hybrid with an accumulative dominance; causal links are present without needing heavy reversal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts a new burden to carry the voices. Cost is implied rather than pressed—no material obstacle or trade‑off tests him on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and held: ritual + object + deck build density to a charged glimpse that reweights “true north.” Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the commitment to navigate a blank map with a reoriented compass, with loss as the ongoing price. Causality is coherent within the lyric mode (sketch → alignment → glimpse → resolve → family reprise). The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterned swaps, sundial chimes, and rising auroral wrongness build to a decisive melt and release of knowledge. Closure lands with a clear before/after—the curse breaks; he descends and recontextualizes the object in the village. Cost is mostly conceptual (taking on stewardship and public sharing) rather than felt peril, keeping it shy of top tier. Orientation is clean from the outset and the two‑shard structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern walking → mechanism click → scroll → second pattern (“heal”) → charged exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the charge and exports memory beyond the gallery, with a conceptual cost stated and felt. Orientation is clean early (gallery, chessboard, interregnum), and causal micro-links are legible. The price is quiet rather than acute, but present in her acceptance of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring motifs (feather, hum, thunder, scent) intensify to a corridor and book reveal, culminating in a conceptual repricing—home as resonance. Orientation is clean early (mountain bookstore, seer, stone), and the scene coheres within one continuous window. Closure lands when she returns the stone and reframes her quest, with cost in confronting fractured remembering and relinquishing a fixed endpoint. The cost is somewhat soft but present in the “shattered” image and the earned stasis of choosing resonance over pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images and tasks (threads → labyrinth → altar → pawn release) build coherently to a closure beat. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the mechanics of entry/payoff link cleanly. Closure lands on-page with a felt cost as he dissolves the haunting pawn and the world restarts. Slight softness in the price paid keeps it shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of echoes/poetry/light intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where forgiveness is earned and the spire glows. Orientation is clear early (Mara, canyon, pre‑ritual), and the closure’s cost is on the page (“the price: acceptance of loss,” “piece of herself”). The ritual’s imminence tightens cadence without needing causal reversals. The end image reweights the premise and reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation lands quickly (iron workshop over acid sea; single POV), and the pattern—speaking kintsugi into being—intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sea calms, statue mends, and doubt is reweighted. Cost is largely conceptual (risking self to intent, relinquishing fear), but it’s legible at the close. The accumulation feels coherent and pays off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images and motifs (mirror, cave, shell, chest) tighten toward a resonant recommitment. Causal links mostly hold (shell → humming → key/scroll → chest → glowing shells → new painting), and the closure lands as a reweighted final image. The cost is implied more than felt; pressure never truly corners the narrator. Still, the pattern culminates coherently with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density crescendos to the cork’s cracking and the lighthouse-heart image (RR/Charged Poise) with cost signaled by the emptied, cracked cork. Orientation is clear from the start (who/where/when). The fisherman’s turn toward the lighthouse and arrival function as proof without coincidental “solve.” Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: calls → engine → hum → ships, with the censer foot as a persistent constraint and conductor. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes a sanctuary and reverse migration begins, with cost in the sorrow etched into coils and the navigator’s endurance. Orientation is clear from the outset (station at night, failing hydraulics). The causal weave is lyrical rather than plot‑tight, but the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: arrival → concealment → storm test → communal reframing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the eye becomes a communal mirror with social cost implied. Causality holds, but the cost is more stated than dramatized, and opposition softens too quickly. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the final image reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate; the accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern density (tide gaps/flower) builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when he aligns the Edelweiss with the longest lull and lights the lamp—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reweights his solitude. Cost is quiet but legible: a commitment to keep another’s memory and to continue keeping watch. The causal throughline is coherent without over‑explaining the uncanny logic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the creek’s rise, the chip’s hum, and the ants’ pattern intensify toward a threshold image. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the doorway appears, he refuses passage, and reprices mapping as choosing, with the cost of forgoing the unknown. Orientation is strong from the outset; causal threads are clean even in a lyric frame. The cost is present but subtle rather than acute, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link coherently: balcony → ascent → grotto map → alcove orb → infusion → burst/quiet. Orientation is clean early; the grotto’s map and the queen’s kiss form functional cause/effect. Closure lands on page with the orb’s burst and the dreams dissolving, though the price is soft. No major teleports or breaks; the pattern taught by the imagery pays off in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual actions build to a charged poise and a conceptual repricing (light as kept vow vs profit). Orientation is strong from the opening, and the sequence is coherent. Closure lands with a persistent commitment (protect the glow, face skeptics), though cost remains mostly conceptual. The pattern tightens through the repeated brush-dipping to the dome and vow.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and motifs intensify toward a closure where the grave is re‑priced and the narrator steps out. Orientation is crisp from line one (cabin, ranger, grave, scroll). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—mortality acknowledged, purpose recommitted. Causal links are soft but sufficient for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: fog lifts, water rises/chimes, and the screw “reborn” reframes the shop’s purpose. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when), and the pattern is taught via fog/clock/screw and paid off at closure. Cost is present conceptually in her anosmia and the chosen devotional labor, though it’s soft rather than biting. The ending’s cadence shift lands cleanly without violating the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps build density toward a resonant reconfiguration where scars become runes. Orientation is crisp from the outset (floating tea platform, Lira’s task), and set pieces pay off (quill, shards, breath, chant). Closure arrives on the page with cost—she relinquishes the weight of her scars rather than erasing them. The causal chain is gentle but coherent, with no unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual intensifies: bottle → vibrations → spiral circuit → blue glow → manifested “Apology to Mara” → release on the axe’s fall. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she sends the apology and feels the weight lift while the orchard exacts a cost. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern taught early is kept. One slight convenience (the titled sheet appears) remains consistent with the piece’s lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density increases (stacks → map → stars → crystal → vortex) to a closure beat where illusions dissolve. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration and a conceptual price—she vanishes, leaving only echoes and the humming dictionary. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/aim) and the pattern taught early is kept. The cost is present but not deeply dramatized, keeping it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (shepherd at a horizon station at sundown), and patterning (counting backward, tide/gear pulses, key hum) coheres toward a Conceptual Repricing: clocks measure “intervals between breaths.” The closure occurs on‑page when the count reaches zero and the system “sighs,” reweighting the premise. Cost is conceptual and quiet rather than dramatic, but it lands as a relinquishment of a purely numeric measure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture: the storm provides the lone concrete test while the motif density builds toward a conceptual repricing. Closure lands in the final image of departure with the button, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is crisp from the start. Tightening exists (storm alert → meshes), though escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean causal chain: coin → panel → descent → scrawls → lantern/mica activation → map → traversal → emergent theorem. Orientation is established early and maintained; the scene respects single‑POV scope. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the “lucid contradiction” enacted in her new theorem and lantern left for the next wanderer—though the on‑page cost is more implied than felt. The drive reads Hybrid with a causal spine and an accumulative final image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the layered calls and the loop’s deepening culminate in a resonant reconfiguration when an unheard voice says “Thank you” and Mara’s stance shifts. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the motif teaches its pattern and pays off. The cost is primarily conceptual/identity-level; it’s legible but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens through recurring motifs (tide shift, sky’s color change, sea’s chant) toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear early (archivist at the jetty at twilight), and the closure image—the covenant’s glow reflected in the locket like a tiny moon—lands with conceptual cost (endurance, cyclical duty). The causal chain is lyric rather than plot‑driven but coherent and purposeful. Cost remains subtle, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: rumor → station → ivy‑map puzzle → reveal → chime → release. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “cure” is catalyzed connection, sealed by her sending the fragment onward. Causality is clean and anchored early; the final cadence shift is legible. The cost is modest but present in the relinquishment and the choice to disperse power.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound density builds to the pure tone, then the step through the veil lands closure via a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is solid early, single POV, single scene. The on‑page cost is soft; the “dissolve into one chord” reads as uplift more than sacrifice. Still, the stillpoint entry/exit provides a legible before/after cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early (lab in an anomaly; interpreter; exotic pen), and patterning (garden/seeds, gravity, unbending) builds to a cadence shift as the anomaly settles. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—acceptance of uncertainty and a stabilized environment—though the cost reads conceptual more than dramatized. The hologram “buds” and settling anomaly provide a visible turn that holds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: Arlen composes the silent music, then months later Lira tests and inherits it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—silence mapped to light becomes an ongoing practice with a living price tied to erasure. Orientation is crisp early; the two-shard structure is legible. The cost remains conceptual more than dramatized, trimming peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: controlled blaze → self‑portrait map → art‑trail → tapestry key → box → vow → murals. Closure lands on the page through a decisive change and earned stasis (he renounces burning to become guardian), with a conceptual cost tied to his past. Orientation is prompt and steady. The path solves too smoothly, reducing felt jeopardy, but the chain is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a primarily Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of rhythms and images builds toward a concrete on‑page shift: the lab’s protocol changes because Lira’s music permeates their dreams. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene escalates without breaking rules. The cost is conceptual/social (abandoning the experimental treatment) rather than personally paid on-page, but it lands. The closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a decisive institutional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal throughline holds: whisper into coin → map activates → radio transmits → key opens tunnel → parchment confirms thesis. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the city is reimagined as a network of whispers, with a charged final contrast (a slammed door/shout versus the whisper’s reach). Cost is minimal and mostly conceptual, so the cadence is satisfying but not searing. Orientation is crisp and consistent within a single scene with one plausible tunnel shift.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the pattern of shutters intensifies toward a lattice of light, then resolves as the mirror lowers—clean RR/CR closure. The before/after is legible: darkness learns its own light; the dock glows. Cost is mostly conceptual (patience/endurance) rather than dramatized loss, keeping the ceiling below the highest band. Orientation is clear early (cobalt dock after rain, guardian at canal) and held without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: synchronized windows build toward a patterned climax and community shift. Orientation is clean early (Mara in the cobalt library) and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the town’s adoption and the final whisper. Cost is conceptual/social rather than personal or material, which keeps the cadence soft. The structure coheres as a single scene with montage beats that pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Causal with lyric inflection. The chain is coherent—hum → scrimshaw pulses → song → island → tower/crystal → whale call → release—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (earned stasis redirecting her force toward peace). Closure cost is on-page via relinquishing the scrimshaw and foreclosing violence, though resistance is minimal. One syntactic stumble (“the crystal unlocked by the call of a whale from the deep”) momentarily blurs action but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and closes with a resonant reconfiguration as the baton and bouquet consecrate a “remade hush.” Orientation is clean from the outset and the pattern (narrated craft as ritual) holds through the ending. Cost is modest but legible: she accepts a constrained, lawful hush instead of overt resistance, foreclosing applause and spectacle. The turbines’ indifferent hymn frames a before/after cadence shift without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterned images intensify toward a reweighted final image (amber lake, steady pulse). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—old prohibitions fold, boundaries dissolve, new cadence holds. Cost is more conceptual than felt; consequences remain largely implied. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each barter intensifies a pattern toward the courtyard’s full awakening and the final glass‑flower garden. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she embraces imperfection as method and outcome—with a legible price (trading symmetry for asymmetry, pigments for revelations). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught and paid off. Cost is more lyrical than dramatic, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual’s density builds to the artificial mind’s sigh and the lamp’s dimming, a Charged Poise that reweights connection. Orientation is clean early (lab, grid stabilized, role, method). Closure lands quietly; the cost is conceptual (renunciation of outward journey for engineered inward pilgrimage) rather than dramatized loss. One continuous scene with a measured cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns (stencil, cranes, coordinates, illumination) build toward a Charged Poise closure as she sets a new crane toward an unseen sunrise. Orientation is clean early; causality is lyrical but coherent (crane—thread—balcony—rose revival—public gardens—renewed vow). The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (lifting a veil of mourning), yet legible on the page. Stakes expand credibly with visitors and secret gardens without breaking the single-drive focus.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers image-signal (glow, hum, snap, droplet) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the pattern of ritual actions coheres. Closure lands as a stance crystallization (purpose found) with conceptual cost (renouncing profit-centric frames), though the price is understated. The beats sequence sensibly without causal leaps or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via pattern avoidance, the pagoda’s hum, and the light’s cascade reweighting the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: purification becomes transformation; he exits with cost (abandoning certainty) and recharged agency. Orientation is clean from the outset; beats progress coherently to the final departure. Cost is legible in the choice to live erratically and carry sorrow with joy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → alignment → warming stone → recharged footage → recording a new video. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he reweights loss into legacy and enacts a preserving ritual; cost appears as the acknowledged loss of unrecorded moments. Orientation is clean early, and the stepwise method gives coherence without and-then drift.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration via a charged final image (tail restored, breath-hued colors, vigilance accepted). Orientation is crisp early (misty workshop, post‑con). Causal threads are light but coherent—ritual density builds to a cadence shift as she reattaches the tail. Cost is implied (scars, vigilance) more than enacted, keeping this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: image density builds toward a ritual that reweights meaning. Orientation is clean early (I, tower at dawn, tunnel) and the hourglass ritual provides clear linkage between beats. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the miracle is released and the narrator’s reading of wounds/time is repriced. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: patterning of hum/thunder, film/letters, and tune/lyrics intensifies to a cadence shift when the chord resolves and the film melts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she absorbs unused love and departs with a reweighted purpose, with a felt cost in the farewell and the self‑alteration. Orientation is clean from the outset (projection booth, film strip), and beats follow a logical inner ritual. The cost is subtle but present on the page in the goodbye and the relinquishing of emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition of tracing intensifies until the “last star” precipitates the cascade of light and the word “freedom.” Closure lands with a felt cost (spent body, instrument left behind) and an after‑effect (archway now humming with verses for travelers). Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the single scene coheres. The tightening is modest but legible as a cadence shift rather than causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (guard, terminal, dune, aftermath), and patterned escalation leads to a closure image: the clock ticks in reverse, sparks seed renewal, silhouettes rise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration more than a hard decisive change; cost is implied (he remains dreamless, endurance required) but not strongly taxed. Causality is lyric but coherent (chant → archive opens → embers → seeding).

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early; the piece builds a patterned density (hum/wind/gear) toward engine ignition and dawn. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing: he reframes the quest from external marvel to internal reclamation, with a felt cost in “raw thoughts” exposed. Causality is soft but coherent within the lyric design; the pattern teaches and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the patterned journey (indirect routes) tightens toward the cave and the chest, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when the ticket opens the clasp and the “map of the inner self” reweights stakes. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the closure is legible. Cost is conceptual (leaving safety, releasing the leash-bound past) rather than dramatized loss, keeping it shy of exceptional. The final image positions an ongoing path, not a mechanical wrap.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: the bolt’s offering triggers the staircase’s color shift, reweighting “safety = silence” with a felt price, and later the guests emerge changed. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard transition (“Later…”) pays off the pressure set earlier. Cost is legible in the acceptance of silence as the condition for safety, charged by the final monument‑like image of the bolt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain: oracle clue → pellet → map → crown → sunder → exposure → exit, with on‑page cost (temple’s collapse, spent pellet). Orientation is immediate and the closure lands decisively. Minor ease—finding the pellet and decoding occur with limited resistance—but within scope the sequence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern (tapping/atlas/data assembly) that accumulates to a cadence shift at the watermark discovery and the console’s coordinate—closure as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but coherent within the lyric mode. The final image reweights their practice without breaking the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through hums, patterning, and resonance until a cadence shift reconfigures the bay and the protagonist’s stance. Orientation is clean early; single scene coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (engines revived; vow; sanctuary), though the cost is more felt than explicit. The because/therefore chain is secondary to the patterned intensification, which the ending honors.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: kite → decoding → ritual → memory cost → unsealing → communal reframing. Closure lands on the page with a tangible price (erased lullabies) and a reweighted future. Convenience creeps in (swift deciphering, rapid communal acceptance), softening pressure. Still, the single-scene window holds and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring somatic cues and the photograph build to a charged poise where she forecloses inertia and chooses a forward path. Orientation is clear early (arboretum on a cliff; survivor context) and never drifts. Closure lands on the page with felt cost when she “freezes the grief for a heartbeat” and commits to a purpose. The tightening is modest but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure holds under an accumulative/textural lens: density builds from library to spiral to descent, culminating in a reconfigured stance. Orientation is clean early (abandoned lighthouse library; solitary painter), and the single transition down the stairwell is motivated. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the phoenix card moment and return upstairs with a redesigned portrait. Cost is present but soft—primarily internal, marked by the door slam and surrender to darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via image-density as the ink becomes a conduit and the encampment “hums,” culminating in a conceptual repricing—time-slow as deliberate deferral. Orientation is strong early and the closure lands with his vow. The cost is partial (threat of disappearance and responsibility assumed) but legible. Causality is less about plot turns than pattern intensification, which is consistent with the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a cadence shift from hush to humming dissent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library becomes a “lighthouse,” the conversation turns spoken, and green shoots signal conceptual cost and change. Causal chain is clean (letter → ignition → ripple → council/archivists respond), though the tangible price to Maren remains mostly prospective. Orientation is solid from the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and acts (sandbags, roses, vows) build toward a dawn‑scene Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clear early (glass dome, tower fallen, Lira in the greenhouse). The ending reconfigures the community’s stance with a conceptual cost (choosing quiet labor over force), though the on‑page price remains soft. The night‑to‑dawn shift provides a meaningful cadence turn.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence rise from listening to planting the spike to the chant and merging with constellations. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he carries the echo and reframes “catching” as releasing. Cost is mostly conceptual (self-boundaries soften; he foregoes possession for stewardship), not explicit, keeping this just shy of top tier. Orientation is clean from the outset (fisher, garden at twilight), and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Causal. The because/therefore chain is clean (call → observatory → nib → hypothesis → deciphering → siren), and closure lands with a decisive shift (ledger revealed; archives opening). The cost is light and convenience intrudes (the console recognizes the nib and swiftly solves the problem). Orientation is strong early; structure is single-scene coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence (“letters → stitching → firmware untangles → lab reconfigured”) coheres and pays off in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is strong from the outset and props track cleanly. Closure lands on the page with a reweighted world and self, though the cost is more implied than felt. The two‑shard sense (private act → public sanctuary) is clean and continuous.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern and sound density build to a resonant reconfiguration where hush reweights the scene. Orientation is clear early (Liora, grotto, mist), and the motif chain (tile→mandala→hush) coheres. Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after, though the cost is gentle and conceptual. The violinist epilogue supports the closure rather than fracturing it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern recognition → naming → communal reweighting culminates in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on the page with the public adoption of “Hearthsteel” and the sky’s stitched dawn, with the cost of the narrator’s past dissolving. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Escalation is one meaningful tightening rather than multiple causal turns, appropriate for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the coin’s rule, the orchard’s response, and the echoes intensify toward a charged reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (theater → coin → orchard after hours), and causality reads as because/therefore within the fable logic. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration—the coin shifts to sunrise, the wish weaves the timeline, and the ghost’s peace has conceptual cost. The cost is soft but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is coherent and accumulative: static shock → geode-as-interface → LED programming → sensory map → test → faint telepathic brush → dissemination. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she confirms telepathic resonance without a pill and names the project. However, the cost at closure is light; the scene does not force a trade-off beyond a tempered skepticism. Orientation is clean and the single-scene window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual actions compound into the amber‑lit closure where the map completes and meaning reconfigures. Orientation is crisp early (coastal caves, solitary map maker, commission) and the pattern remains coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with the leaf’s oracle status and her reframed role. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under a hybrid leaning-accumulative lens, action flows cleanly: buttons → echo response → instruction → arrangement → release and bridge. Closure lands on the page with a visible change (the echo freed, the bridge formed, world beginning to rewrite). The causal links are coherent, though the price paid is light and mostly conceptual. Orientation is strong early and never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The patterned actions (snow codes → pillbox stars → altar projection → pass) coherently build to a Conceptual Repricing: unused courage as a state, not a place. Closure lands on the page, but the cost is soft; magic‑adjacent mechanics ease passage rather than tightening options. Orientation is sound early and the pattern taught; escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the gutters’ ticking sets a pattern, the fog and listening accrue, and a cadence break (final tick → silver strand) yields closure. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the river “keeps its promise,” the surface becomes a “finished stitch,” and Arlen departs lighter. Cost is implied (relinquishing regret) rather than sharply legible on the page, limiting peak impact. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thrum intensifies, lantern reweighted by kindness, and the bees’ reawakening crystallizes a quiet closure. The final act—offering light to dormant hives—creates a before/after with an on‑page shift (hives awaken, lantern steadies). Cost is present but light (endurance, letting the oasis “resist” and leaving the lantern behind). Orientation and rule learning are clean and timely.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around a ritualized act that deepens from hush to steadied breath, closing on a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis image (glowing vines into dawn, commitment to return). Orientation is clear and the recurring objects pay off, but the on‑page cost is soft, keeping the closure resonant rather than decisive. Causality holds without unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the ritual builds to the library’s song and a charged final image (sundial at the edge, vow). Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and the closure functions as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. The cost is soft—more reframing than sacrifice—yet a before/after is legible (mute library to choral agency; isolation to independence). The single-scene flow holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the spiral’s hum, petal, and silver light tighten the pattern toward a conceptual repricing where Mira accepts the keeper role as conduit. Orientation is strong early, and the closure lands on the page with a reweighted final image (ink constellations, thread glowing). Cost is soft but legible as a renunciation of mere anonymity in favor of public stewardship. One scene, single POV, coherent beat flow.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the broadcast layers a subsonic pattern, counters a false alarm, and culminates in a charged community shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the station becomes a forum/lighthouse) rather than a decisive change. The because/therefore chain is intact, but the cost at the end reads thin. Structure is coherent with one continuous arc and clean anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: organ note → compass activates → passage unfolds → key retrieved → meaning reweighted. Orientation is strong early, and closure arrives on the page as Conceptual Repricing with a felt endurance cost. Escalation is smooth rather than tight; the path offers little true jeopardy beyond internal pressure. Still, the causal spine holds without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure deepens from mist and silence to the ribbon’s child’s name, then to the fissure and carved names, landing in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and the single‑scene focus holds. Closure arrives on‑page via a charged final image (stone tear, ribbon glint) that reweights the premise with some conceptual cost. The path is more incantatory than causal, but the pattern is taught and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset; the causal chain is clean: journals → chamber → nail → alarms → decision to seal. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: embedding the nail forecloses flight and fixes meaning with a cost (risk during the vortex; relinquishing the object to concrete). The final “jet stream settled” echo reweights the premise without over-explaining. The on-page cost is felt but modest, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs compound (map/song/glass/pixels) toward a clear on‑page closure image where amnesty manifests and a vow reconfigures the premise. Orientation is clean from the opening (who, where, when) and the legend’s rule set is stable. Cost is present but modest (burden of mission, ash‑like weight) rather than a hard trade‑off. The sequence (arrival → guided ascent → performance → image → vow) coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crash + return to the train reweight “loops” as tests rather than failures, with cost legible in the failed startup and his measured pivot. Orientation is clear early; the two‑shard structure (rise/fall → train return) coheres. Some transitions are summarized, but the final image cleanly seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the telegram cues sharing, which leads to sky-reading, projection, and the temple opening; the cadence tightens toward dawn. Closure lands on the page with an on‑scene reconfiguration (temple door opens; crystal-telegram duet), though the price is primarily conceptual/emotional. Orientation is clean from the outset (observatory at night, Mara at her desk/journal/telescope). The sequence remains coherent without contrived leaps, but the cost signal is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: ritual rings, shards, and the seed’s hunger build to a resonant reconfiguration as the lake’s reflection changes and the truth is sealed. Causality is legible (chant → melting → shards → seed reweighted → amulet seal), and closure lands on the page. Cost is mostly conceptual—accepting guardianship and redirecting a dangerous tool—rather than sharply felt. Orientation is clear early; single‑scene integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens fits: ritual steps (heed stones → touch scars → vision → key → chant → portal → beacon) cohere and culminate in an on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration—the beacon ignites; she becomes “the bridge.” Cost is mostly conceptual (inheritance of covenants) and could read softer than ideal, but sequence and stakes remain intelligible. Orientation (who/where/when) is early and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a held Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens through ritual acts culminating in the card’s dissolution into amber. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the relic is transmuted, the orchard breathes easier, and her resolve is reweighted. Cost is implied by the earlier pact and “sacrifice” but is not materially tested at the end, softening impact. No causality breaks or teleporting props; the pattern it teaches is paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: detail density and recurring objects build to a resonant reconfiguration rather than a causal flip. Closure lands in the final two beats—the amber calm and the cloth’s reprise with the record player—repricing “applause” as a private, durable purpose. Cost is legible as renunciation of external validation after shame. Structure is clean across two shards (evening to morning) with continuity of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene accumulates patterned actions (frequency tuning, verse‑pulses) toward a resonant reconfiguration where harmony returns and Lira reframes her drive, then chooses to journey. Closure lands through a cadence shift and conceptual repricing of ambition, though the cost is modest and largely implied. Orientation is strong early, and causality within the lyric logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs layer from the “disappearance of tomorrow” to the key merging with the creel. Orientation is clean from the opening; cause-and-effect is lyrical yet coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the atrium becomes a beacon, the librarian repositions purpose with a conceptual cost. The cost is present but subdued, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: confessions absorbed → pearl brightens → crowning ritual → placement as beacon. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration with tangible cost (she assumes stewardship; bunker doors remain sealed). Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The turn is quiet but legible and paid for in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the patterned pursuit (graffiti → tunnel → river → vow) tightens into a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The cost is legible in endurance and ongoing price (post‑medication ache, commitment to repeat the pilgrimage). Orientation is clean, single scene coherence intact. The closure lands in the on‑page promise to continue, reweighting the premise without tying it up.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries build from watch→delays→glyphs→crystal→garden. Closure reads as conceptual repricing (the library is itself a living cipher), but cost is soft. Orientation is stable from the opening. Turns are gentle and sequential rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene causal arc is clear: coffee reading and plant warnings lead to the choice to song‑weaponize dissent, producing the envoy’s reversal and the city’s autonomy (Decisive Change). Orientation is firm early, and the motifs cohere without rule breaks. The cost at closure is mostly conceptual/emotional and the solution feels slightly convenient, dulling the pressure of the final turn. Still, the closure lands on the page with a before/after marked.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of ritual action builds to a charged poise as the chip captures light. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure lands with the aurora dimming and the chip’s placement as beacon. Cost is present conceptually (a fraction of aurora surrendered; last spark sequestered), though it’s gently rendered. The final image reweights the premise without mechanical tying-off.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural mosaic holds: dawn ritual → ongoing caretaking → storm → harvest → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration around forgiveness and seasonal return, with the hairpin charging the last beat. Causality is gentle rather than pressing; the cost is mostly prior and conceptual. Still, set‑ups pay off (hairpin as compass; sunrise alignment), and orientation is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the wind‑chime pattern, mirror projection, and unhooking culminate in a resonant reconfiguration: the magistrate accepts doubt as mantle. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure carries conceptual cost—certainty loosens before the law is sealed—and the final image reweights prior motifs. The chain is elegant if gentle, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the stone‑rings pattern, trance, and magnetic pull build to a conceptual repricing in the grotto. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on the page with her reframed understanding of “teaching vanishing to appear.” Cost is present as disciplined withholding, though it’s soft. Structure is cohesive with one transition and a legible cadence shift at the vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and pressures (pulse, birds, arrowhead, bone towers) thicken toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Orientation is clean and the final acceptance of still navigation provides closure. Cost is present but soft, framed as a quiet renunciation rather than a felt loss. A sharper hinge—where a nontrivial option is foreclosed—would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—images and cadence tighten toward a conceptual repricing: “letting go” as sacred practice. Orientation is clean and the scene holds a single throughline to a charged final image (the pulse and fireflies). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration with a legible before/after, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. The because/therefore chain is light, but the pattern and payoff cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a soft causal spine. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) and the sequence—key tag → lock → descent → glowing book → ribbon/sigil—progresses cleanly. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he externalizes the “color of sound” and commits to a next quest; the cost is conceptual rather than dramatic. Slight lightness of pressure keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, taught by iterative static‑decoding and coin pops culminating in a cadence break (the final instruction and hum). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: purpose reframed as frequency with a charged final image (micro‑fracture, shared breath). Orientation is clean early; the single scene coheres. Cost is implied (risk/chaos warning, crack) rather than strongly dramatized, but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: naming each crystal deepens the pattern and culminates in the remembered name in the stars. Orientation is immediate (observatory at dusk, reaper, page), and causality is clean: atlas page → crystallization → chants → naming → aurora → personal memory. Closure lands on page with a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief’s rule is reweighted. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of “endless mourning.”

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure coheres via the drip‑pattern densifying until cadence snaps into alignment. Closure lands on the page: the bell’s ring reconfigures the world (fish return, stars tilt), a Resonant Reconfiguration purchased by patience and precision. Orientation is clean from the first lines; single scene holds. Cost is subtle (endurance, risk of failure) but legible within the ritual’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the photographs accrue into a reconfiguration where the town accepts a new narrative. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands with a charged reprise (label by the chime; wind resounding). Cost is mostly conceptual/communal rather than personal, which softens impact yet remains legible. The pattern holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density escalates (flame syncs, mist reveals frescoes, explosion into shards) toward a final cadence shift as she ingests a shard and the flame turns amber. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: she seals the bridge “before the final transformation.” Causality is clean within the ritual logic. Cost is primarily conceptual (yielding control to awe), which reads but is soft on tactile consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via storm, lost transmission, ascent, repair, and the “Hold fast” reply that reweights the work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—renewed purpose under cost rather than a decisive external change. Orientation is solid early, and the single scene coheres. Cost is present but subtle (ongoing burden rather than a priced tradeoff).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid lens with causal dominance: Kael chooses to slice the cylinder, triggering awakening and a social reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the scene holds a single throughline to closure. Closure lands (RR/CR) with a before/after, but the price is light—no repercussion or tradeoff beyond broken glass and a quick consensus. The custody conflict resolves conveniently, reducing structural bite.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation and sequence are clean: envelope → seed → design → participants solve → airflow → bloom. Closure occurs on‑page with the bloom and a conceptual reweighting of her design ethos, but the cost at the ending is soft (no concrete sacrifice, only a stated understanding). The piece reads Hybrid with a causal spine and an accumulative atmospheric lift; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hourglass triggers a cadence shift, density builds through sound imagery, and the final image reconfigures the house from prison to backdrop. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (joy returned while haunting persists). Orientation is clear from the outset; causality is lyric but coherent. The beat progression is legible and self-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pendant encounter concentrates pattern, and the ending reconfigures stance into an earned stasis/charged poise. Causality is coherent: pendant → contemplation/ritual → elective waiting → wing opening. Cost is implied (risk of awakening breach; self-binding to patience) though not vividly tested. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: collect ash → first elixir → adjust at the penny drop → second elixir with phoenix feathers → eruption. Orientation is immediate (ember nexus, crozier, single POV) and the pattern (successive approximation timed to the penny) is taught and kept. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the crozier revives, realm vivifies). The felt cost at closure is modest, more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: a pattern of tuning → chord → dawn activation → broadcast resolves into a city/village reawakening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (rebirth) rather than a decisive sacrifice; cost is light but the cadence shift to dawn and communal response reads. Orientation is crisp early (tower over gorge, lunar perigee, single POV). Minor deduction for the absence of a concrete price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound builds, silhouettes form, hourglass reweights time, and the ferry returns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the timelines are sealed and the hourglass becomes a compass. The cost is conceptual rather than felt; little resistance or trade-off diminishes impact. Orientation is crisp from the outset; props and setting pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: weaving intensifies into eruptions, dissolution, bridge crossing, and a conceptual repricing (“imagination can be measured”). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/aim), and the single scene escalates coherently. Closure lands as a resonant realization and reweighted world-image, though the cost is soft and largely conceptual. The return to the street provides a clear after-state without undercutting the lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and technical method build toward a Charged Poise closure as she returns the link and vows to continue. Orientation is clear from the outset, and recurring elements resolve coherently. However, escalation is summarized rather than dramatized—no concrete obstacle complicates the launch—so the cost at closure is largely conceptual. The final image reweights meaning, but decisive change is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pulses → photograph → alcove → choral resonance → restored image forms a coherent intensification. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a vow crystallized by the image’s restoration and the narrator’s acceptance of ongoing burden. Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality holds within the fable-logic. Minor convenience (easy discovery/entry to the alcove) doesn’t undercut the on‑page cadence shift and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: causality is clear (tide → arrays hum → alignment → phase transit → return), while pattern and cadence do the charging. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she returns and buries the codex, foreclosing access in favor of stewardship. The cost is conceptual rather than felt as pain, which tempers impact. Orientation is clean early and the single transition is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual with ink and porcelain teaches a pattern that tightens into the shard’s chime and the ghost’s confession. Closure lands with a reconfiguration (ghost halts; single pulse; ghost reframed as mirror). Causal beats connect (ink keys → latch → confession → halt), though the cost is conceptual more than felt. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of pattern (birds → diamond → chimes → sealing silence) coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: the language is preserved yet sealed from living tongues. Orientation is clean from the start; single scene, one dominant stake. The escalation is elegant but relatively low-friction, which trims peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the phone’s static → vine scaffold → arrowhead shatter → conceptual repricing (beast as song) escalates cleanly. Orientation is early and solid; causal threads are magical but coherent. Closure lands on the page with cost (arrowhead’s destruction, renunciation of bitterness) and a reweighted world‑rule. Slight softness remains in how and why the shatter occurs, but the pattern supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies from soft bowing to orchard‑wide resonance to regime reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: statues become guardians, gears hum, world hue shifts. Cost is implied (risk of regime reprisal) but not dramatized at the end, which keeps the cadence from a higher tier. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence at the end: a causal spine (drone approaches → storm blinds → truce delivered → acknowledgement) carries a quiet Charged Poise closure. The dominant stake (opening a channel of truce) resolves on-page with the crossing drones and the kept vow. Cost is implied (risk and expending the storm), though it’s not sharply priced. A continuity slip—“empty bottle” versus “remained sealed”—nicks the finish yet doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece tightens through the song → fog → reveal → descent → choral reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the halo’s choir “stitches the broken silence” into an ongoing symphony. Cost is mostly conceptual (a vow to keep the quiet alive), not materially felt, tempering impact. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density and patterning intensify to the projection in the atrium, then settle into a charged stasis as she logs the event. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—memories reawakened, then the vow of ongoing care—though the on‑page cost remains gentle. The beats link through method rather than causal jeopardy, but the cadence shift is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn rituals → charged photograph → filament caught by Lio → conceptual closure as shared longing becomes bridge. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (reframing the quest as communal transmission), though the on‑page price is subtle. Orientation is early and clean; mosaic shift to Lio is legible. Escalation is more deepening than turning, but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and closes: the ribbon’s groove discovery and untying reweight the world and yield a luminous filament (RR/CR). Orientation is solid early (nexus, locksmith, star cue). Causality is simple but intact (star hint → path → groove → release). Cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning causal: tracing broken constellations → sextant confirmation → arranging caps → water recedes/memories return. Closure is on‑page and legible, but the price paid is soft; the solution arrives without a tested sacrifice or foreclosed option. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene arc holds. A sharper cost or constraint at the climax would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal threads: decoding → timed sun strike → shattering → map → altar healing. Closure lands on‑page via the shadow’s dissolution and the library’s “breathing”/walls healing (RR with a light CR tint). The double crest (shards, then altar) is coherent but slightly diffuses peak concentration; cost is implied rather than explicit. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds patterned imagery (mist, seed, spores, hush) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the wonder is externalized via the traveler’s sprig. Closure is on-page and legible, but cost is primarily conceptual (commitment and stewardship) rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear early: the parapet, the pruner, the seed, and the waterfall. The structure coheres as a single scene with small intensifications (seed awakening, storm threat, traveler’s plea) culminating in the gifting act.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pressure builds via the ritual’s cadence (each knot loosened, spirits released) toward an Earned Stasis/RR. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and closure lands with the mask’s recharged hush and sanctuary sealed. The causal spine is simple but coherent, with one meaningful tightening as the net collapses to a single thread. Cost is present though subtle (dimming starlight, the sanctified weight), sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image layering and pattern alignment build toward the realization that the tear is a portal, culminating in the chapel’s muted reawakening. Orientation is strong and single‑scene containment is clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with implied cost (bearing communal grief), though that cost isn’t sharply priced on the page. The sequence of projector → overlay → alignment reads coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: object recurrence and density build toward a charged closure image (the shattering globe/last note). Orientation is clean (who/where/mission set early), and beats proceed coherently from untangling to listening to sealing. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: letting go reframed as energy release with an elegiac cost. Slight softness in concrete consequence and external pressure keeps it short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lightning-beat pattern builds density; each press/graffiti addition ratchets the dialogue until the ghost’s reply and integration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost becomes a mural/archive and the plate becomes a living cipher. Cost is conceptual (the balladeer encodes his own longing), legible but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of goggles enables decoding the diary, which reveals the chamber, leading to retrieval of joy and a charged return. Orientation is strong from the outset; single POV and two clear shards (upper spire → hidden chamber → return). Closure lands as a gentle Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration—the spire’s sorrow melts and he adopts a vow. The cost is largely conceptual/emotional, not dramatized, keeping it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds density from categorizing clouds to comet-sighting, culminating in a charged poise/CR that reweights absence as memory. Orientation is strong early, and the recurring objects (brass telescope, broken strings) bind the scene. Closure lands in the final cadence as she records the comet and leaves; cost is subtle but legible in the vigil’s solitude and renunciation. A slightly soft price keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritualized craft under time pressure builds to the coin-press and the demolition. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands as a charged poise: the building falls while the “cathedral of sky” remains, making cost and before/after legible. The coin’s groove‑timed intervals and final press stitch cause and cadence into the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is crisp early (antique airship, map apprentice at the cartographic table), and the piece holds a clear Accumulative/Textural drive. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the halo is harnessed, the ship’s hum re-synced, and the final image reweights earlier motifs. The cost remains soft—risk of draining the ship is invoked but never tested on the page—tempering impact. Still, the sequence of actions (pattern → phrase → chalk route → engine sync) coheres without teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: discovery → guidance by prophecy → unlocking → assembly → insertion → sunrise. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (time resumes, inner rhythm steadies). Causality is fable-logic but consistent, with no teleports or dropped setups. Cost is modest yet legible through sustained burden and mission-continuance rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: chalk message → convening → timed bell chime → communal vow. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (community re-commits to resource ethics), though cost is mostly conceptual. Orientation is clean from the opening and the bell-peaking clock provides a light structural spine. The ending image coheres, but without a sharper price paid on the page, the turn remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual tightens from approach to activation to hush to borrowed pause, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the lantern’s flare and the world’s pause. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the pattern taught (tick/silence/hush) coheres through closure. Cost is present but soft—“the weight of a thousand lifetimes” gathers on the puppet head rather than confronting a hard obstacle. Still, the before/after is unmistakable and earned by on‑page action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on the page with cost: the act completes, light blooms, travelers escape, and the orchard remains cursed—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reweights the premise. The clock (before frost) and birds’ vigilance tighten cadence into the stump placement. The final renunciation (retreat; role done yet demanded again) makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the lattice/foam motif coheres into a resonant reconfiguration: grief → method → bridge → social application → cyclical return with the child’s chrysalis. Orientation is clean and the time expansion after the ravine scene remains legible. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing of loss into connective design, with felt cost in leaving the lab and reinterpreting failure. Escalation is gentle but causally linked throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds (counting voids → brightening → incision → release → chorus → child’s uncapping) toward a reweighted final image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/resonant reconfiguration: origin is a moment of quantified absence turned to light, sealed by the library’s chord announcing a new story. Causality is ritual rather than conflict-driven but coherent; anchors are clear early. Cost is gentle and mostly conceptual (quest dissolving), limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain → pavilion → tasting → contagion intensifies → dissolution → humming aftermath. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost as sorrow spreads before release and the coral “cracks with a sigh,” a clear before/after. Orientation is clean early, and the price of action registers in the environment. A hair more narrowing-of-options or a sharper on‑page risk would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean single‑POV accumulative structure: early anchors (librarian, clock tower, city silos) and a clear sequence (retrieve weight → chime → chorus → bridge‑building → dawn reprise). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s soundscape and social fabric reweighted, symbolized by returning the weight and the dawn chime. Cost is largely conceptual; the scene reads smooth with little resistance. Accumulative/Textural drive is taught and held.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through calibration, hum, tremor, and the dawn cadence shift. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes her mission from recording to reviving and carries off humming shards. Cost is present but modest (risk of fracture, psychic tug, tremor). Orientation is strong from the opening and the through-line remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causal lens holds: doodle appears → eligibility cues → inversion window → cipher → glyph → seedlings → return and placement. Orientation is clear early, and the single‑POV, one‑sequence structure stays coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: seedlings become lamps that recode the library’s vigilance mandate. However, cost at the end is light; danger or trade‑off is implied rather than dramatized, softening the closure’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens as each crack is decoded, culminating in the porcelain’s sigh and the grove’s breathed chord. Orientation is immediate (grove, sculptor, insulator), and the throughline remains single-scene and clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s “silence” is repriced as music-bearing. Cost is implied (tender labor, the sculpture’s sorrow released) rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses → listening → phrase spoken → sky’s sliver → rook placed, reweighting the covenant as “paused conversation.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (accepting exile and sorrow as compass) more than a concrete one. Orientation is solid from the outset; pattern teaching is consistent. The cost signal at the end is felt but not sharply escalated, keeping the ceiling below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the patterned setup (tuning, listening, naming silences) coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration when the clasp opens and the town “listens.” Closure lands through CR/RR: the world is reweighted toward empathy, and he chooses a path of teaching. The causal sequence is legible (plates → glow → ink → vow → apprentices), though cost is subtle. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern (seed → sprout → bloom) tightens toward the communal inhalation and the sealed doodle with essence, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset (treetop village, herbalist, seed). The closure lands, though the legible cost is light (time, endurance, the potent perfume). Causality is more ritual accretion than pressure-driven turns, but coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: navigate → detect resonance → discover tip → growth surge → return and relinquish. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: resilience reframed from object to practice, with the price of giving up a powerful tool. The inversion hour provides a mild ticking clock that coheres the scene. Escalation is modest but coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative build from measurement to release is coherent, with orientation locked early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the vortex sighs and the city’s hum returns; the patch’s reprise helps seal it. Cost is soft—resolution comes smoothly once the vector is identified—so the ending feels more graceful than hard‑won. Still, the because/therefore of the accumulative pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Reads as an accumulative/textural build: sound-light density crests, the cavern “answers,” and a charged quiet returns with memory—an RR in the final image. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene scope holds. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the closure lands, but the price is light. The two‑shard feel (inside → outside) supports cadence shift without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: hush motifs and object returns build to a seam crossing and a quiet repricing of “guardianship.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reframes the role and returns with a vow—though the on‑page cost remains conceptual more than dramatized. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the sequence—markers → seam → crossing → return—holds coherently. A single tightening at the seam suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via pattern density—printing, infusion, refracted ciphers—culminating in the halo’s cracking and the shard collection. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: emotion redefined as a transposed function, with the price of continued self‑unmaking. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the ending image reweights prior details without a causal break. The cost is more thematic than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: a sequence of pendant‑mediated encounters builds toward the legend/pilgrimage coda. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—his small acts accrue into myth—yet the on‑page cost at the end is faint. The structure is coherent but lacks a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres via density—shifted hush, frost blooming, grief pulse, engine ignition—toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure is on-page: the world reweights as she accepts the cost that objects carry absorbent sorrow, and she steps onto the road with a burden. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the causal thread is clean. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than enacted under duress, keeping it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle-to-pedestal-to-filament is a coherent intensification. Closure lands on the page with the bead dimming and the silence dissolving; the cost is felt though largely conceptual. Orientation is clean from the outset. A slightly clearer on‑page price beyond “leave something of herself” could have lifted it further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: rumor → mines → barter → silk → forging → communal reveal and effect. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and light Resonant Reconfiguration: the blade’s action literally knits ground, reweighting the world’s possibility. The price is on-page (memory lost), though the path is smooth with little resistance. Lens: Causal, held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: shard aligns maps → slit opens → alternate bay → hidden log → decision to merge realities. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change: awakening the crew and losing the shard. Cost is present but modest (sacrifice of the shard and implied world-ripple). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is immediate (skipper at a crumbling lighthouse at night), and the scene holds to one continuous window. Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands when the lamp dies and the stone spiral pulses, reconfiguring the beacon’s meaning (from oil to memory), with Marek choosing to carry the talisman. The cost is soft—practical peril of a dark lighthouse is implied rather than confronted. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual acts accrete (beam inward, prism, serpent of light) to a reweighted final image/vow. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—rebirth in “shadowed brilliance”—but the on‑page price is symbolic (newspaper’s end) rather than felt. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern remains legible. A single meaningful tightening (“act now” to aim the serpent at the reef) prevents drift into pure tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: a steady build from tea house to alcove revelation to garden loom activation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she understands the “iridescent caution” principle and commits to guarding it. Cost is mostly conceptual; little on-page resistance or narrowing of options reduces impact. Nonetheless, the on-page turn (wing to beacon) provides a concrete cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure thickens via patterned work (mapping dreams → grid dimming) to a cadence shift as the tower “inhales.” Orientation is crisp from the opening: who, where, when are legible within the first lines. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the maze’s sorrow becomes measurable peace and Eli’s promise forecloses future echo—though the price is more glancing than bracing. The beats link coherently without outliney “and then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: songs → window refracts → orchard responds → spirits gather → dawn swells → vow. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a credible before/after image (endless night to gentle sunrise) and a modest cost (eternal guardianship). Orientation is clear early (greenhouse, mica window, Lira’s role), and patterning remains coherent. Lack of on‑page resistance limits the sense of earned difficulty but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is firm early (attic → invitation → midnight → library beneath the market), and the piece coheres through a steady pattern of images. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: admitting the mistake unlocks the chamber, and he exits reweighted, carrying grief rather than discarding sanctuary. Cost is legible (ownership of past harm; surrendering noise), though consequences remain largely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story assembles images toward a Charged Poise closure—the loaf reduced to crumbs in amber tea‑light, the tea house “breathing,” and his quiet resolve. Orientation is clear from the outset and the pattern holds. Cost is modest but present (loneliness persists; the loaf is consumed; he renounces grand epiphany for a fragile ritual). The ending’s cadence shift lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: measurement density builds to the final hum and pulse, producing a resonant reconfiguration where oblivion “recedes.” Orientation is clean and the object/tool constraints are consistent. Closure lands on the page via the awakened slide and the spoken vow; cost is conceptual and gently earned. A touch more consequence would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain (anticipating false starts → decoy → confusion → sprint to storage → lantern toss → elders and ticking watch) supports a Hybrid drive with a Situational end stance (truce holds until sunrise). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she keeps the hush through a costly tactic. Stakes and options are coherent, though the scout encounter resolves quickly, softening climax pressure. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens: devices converge, flavor shifts cascade, forest “vote” nudges humidity, convergence completes, and Arin reprices his premise. Orientation is clear early; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive act. The cost is modest but legible as a shift in stance and epistemic humility. Causal threads are coherent without needing strong reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates cleanly: lock → painting + mirror → alignment → vial → sealing. Orientation is strong from the opening (cave, Lena, locker), and the closure lands on‑page via a decisive change (the lock opens; creativity released). Causality is poetic but traceable (“align the mirror’s reflection with the lock’s teeth” is the functional hinge). The visible cost is modest, more vow and surrender to sorrow than sacrifice, but sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative build (motifs/objects) feeding a causal endpoint: rereading → doorway → bottles → conduit → vent responding to truth. Orientation is crisp and the two‑shard flow is legible. Closure lands on the page with an environmental Decisive Change (sky clears) tied to the established rule. Cost is present (refusal of loyalty, risk) but light on immediate repercussion, keeping it short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a single scene of ritual maintenance scaling to a Charged Poise closure (the kinetic sculpture’s heartbeat persisting into night). Orientation is firm early (bluff, workshop, wind, iceberg), and the pattern is taught and held. Closure cost is implied—ongoing vigilance and chosen silence—rather than dramatized. The cadence tightens toward the final vow, but the price remains soft on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (dome, desert rose farm, android caretaker; magnetic shift inciting). Causal chain is coherent: shielding flickers → risk of burn escape → Vira miniaturizes chaos → controlled burn succeeds → reconfiguration of meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (fear repurposed; vigilance softened). The price is present but more thematic than materially felt, keeping it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Reads as accumulative/textural: the locket’s whisper → letters cascade → public exhibit → communal response → the child’s coda. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration (listening transforms the shop into a communal healing site), though the on‑page cost is light. Orientation and continuity are sound, with one continuous window. The ending’s sea-echo image pays the established pattern without a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dance → dice resonance → crystal retrieval → lab’s rise → departure creates a coherent pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the lab transformed and pages left behind. Cost is mostly conceptual (privacy surrendered, secrets reconfigured) rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is clean early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats tighten: coffee‑ground omen → chamber activation → excavation → unlocking slab → memory retrieval → environmental reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual repricing: memories are “compressed into pockets of gravity” and then released, stabilizing the world. The causal chain remains legible and coherent, though the felt cost is modest and the pressure never truly imperils her options. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear causality under an accumulative/textural lens: ritual steps build to sealing the prophecy. Closure lands on the page as the brook slows and the code is contained; the celestial‑terrestrial binding completes. Cost is implied (secrecy/endurance), not sharply dramatized. Orientation is strong from the start; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the meteor shower, seal, and tea ritual accrue toward a conceptual repricing of the quest (from decoding to “hearing heartbeats”). Orientation is crisp; the two‑shard close (next evening) is clean. Closure lands as a quiet commitment and reweighted aim, though cost is gentle. The causal thread (sugar → weekly tea → pact framed by seal) holds without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: twilight deepens, song accrues, and the cadence shifts at dawn into a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page when she lifts the shell and accepts the shell’s silence; the before/after is legible with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the pattern never breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the density builds from tracing to revelation to resonance to release, landing in a resonant reconfiguration when the key melts and the vow reframes her practice. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the pattern holds. The closure’s cost is conceptual/emotional rather than tactical, but it’s on the page. One clean tightening—tuning verses to the drip—prepares the closing hum and vow.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered revelations lead to the cavern, the lattice of lives, the lament, and the unification of shells. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the rule of echoes is reweighted from sound to memory seeking release—triggered by her on‑page act. Orientation is clean early (singer, canyon, night) and the path coheres. The cost is present but soft, lodged in the responsibility she assumes and the sorrow she sings into the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream‑mapping → lattice recognition → window formation → final invitation → set‑out across the ice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the globe brightens, shards begin returning, she departs charged with starlight. Cost is soft (endurance, surrender to the dream‑tide) but legible in the relinquishing control to a collective process. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density builds through recurring fireflies/whistle/whisk motifs with a two‑shard night‑to‑night structure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the second night answers the first with a luminous chorus, but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. Orientation is clean and the pattern holds. A firmer price or foreclosed option at the end would lift impact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean causal chain: rumors → letters → map → diamond → redefinition of “stillpoint,” with on‑page closure (storms cease; stance shifts). The drive reads primarily causal with a light conceptual repricing at the end. The resolution feels easy—no significant obstacle once the puzzle is solved—and cost is mostly conceptual. Still, the ending lands coherently within this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: mirrors → coils → drones → pulse of light → pledged allegiance. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration as the storm-forged dawn arrives and the people choose the variant allegiance. Causality is coherent within the lyric mode, though costs and reversals are minimal. Orientation is clean from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build (music box→jars→wind→child) toward a resonant reconfiguration where solitude becomes shared stewardship. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands on-page with a felt, if gentle, cost (yielding lonesome isolation for communal purpose). The turn is subtle rather than decisive, but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: tuning the key → ice chorus → hidden panel → descent → rune-harmony → retrieval → calibrated cradle → final absolution. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when clear), and the single-scene window holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she secures the Heart’s mode of action toward healing, with on-page consequence. Cost is subtle but present in her renunciatory calibration and self-binding duty.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating at the moon’s apex and the viaduct’s surge. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she “unyokes the rush,” with the crack of release as on‑page cost. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. The because/therefore chain is minimal, but the cadence shift and final reweighting are firm.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning Causal. Because/therefore progression (seepage mapping → humidity/lantern correlation → symbols → pipe → valve turn) lands a Decisive Change on the page. Closure is clean and resonant, but the cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt in-scene, softening impact. Orientation is strong and the single-scene architecture holds.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single, coherent scene with a clean causal run: second opinion → decision to adjust → contact with spring → light-triggered ignition → renewed ministry stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the heart beats and reweights his ministry. The cost is subtle and mostly conceptual; no genuine risk or loss is dramatized. Hybrid lens with accumulative cadence at the end holds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: imagery layers and culminates in the bell’s inaudible note and the algorithm’s satisfied log, then a charged pivot to the next quest. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—having rung the unheard bell, the system reweights the world into a new map. However, the on‑page cost at the ending is slender; success arrives without a meaningful trade‑off. Orientation is strong from the outset, and causal through‑lines are coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: the resurfaced patch → metadata numbers → deliberate lie → algorithmic scattering → hidden server → checksum → vault opening → public post that resurfaces files. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: absence becomes stored presence, with a quiet ethical cost in weaponizing the archive’s fabric. Orientation is crisp from the opening; single-POV continuity is clean. The turns resolve a bit easily (paths vanish but decode quickly), slightly softening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions accrete toward the reconstitution and steadier beam. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s breath syncing and the lighthouse’s rhythm steadying reweight the premise. Orientation is clean early (lighthouse orchard above ice, shard under pine, van of mirrors). Cost is implied more than felt, which trims the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind, ice, and communal ritual accrete to a quiet closure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the narrator renounces the original death‑seeking path for attentive acceptance, with the cost implied in what is given up. Orientation is clean from the first sentence. Stakes tighten via the volunteers’ vigil and the rising wind.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of whispering, planting, and listening densifies toward a resonant reconfiguration as he dissolves the letter. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—relinquishing the talisman to the soil—and a clear before/after stance. Orientation is anchored early (bus departing, pavilion, vineyard), and the single scene maintains coherence. The because/therefore chain is lyric rather than causal, but the cadence shift at the end is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: prophet’s arrival → consecration → conjured clearing → teaching → explanation → departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts an ongoing role to carry the echo across the dunes. The cost is implied (endless service, solitude), not sharply dramatized, limiting impact. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: pattern density builds (arcs, vines, scent), villagers arrive, and the feather reveal reweights the ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: communal tracing of arcs and feather “dusting” produces a felt before/after with the cost of tears and vulnerability. Orientation is strong early; the single scene holds cleanly. The cost is modest but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → pattern recognition → offering, with a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the crystal returns to shape the ending image. The cost is conceptual—relinquishing the sufficiency of dictionaries—and lands on the page via her chosen offering. Escalation is subtle but coherent; one meaningful deepening occurs when the glints resolve into the library’s memory.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern (echoes, tide, chalk) build to a conceptual repricing—capturing aging becomes letting it ripple. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/quest). Closure lands on the page with the act of recording and the final inscription, and a felt cost in accepting forgetting’s inevitability. The cost is more hushed than sharp, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres around aligning the spinning hand’s inertia with the telescope and the leaf‑timed metronome. Closure is on‑page with RR: the hand surrenders excess spin and becomes steady power, reweighting the observatory’s purpose. Causality is metaphorical yet consistent (“when the leaf’s echo reached his ear… alignment reached the required escape velocity”). Cost is subtle but legible as a relinquishment and recalibration rather than a dramatic sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the music, vinyl, and “scent of hope” build toward a Charged Poise ending with Mr. Harlan’s last breath and the staff taking keepsakes. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single scene tightens in cadence to a legible closure with cost. The final image reweights earlier motifs without mechanical wrap‑up. Lack of friction prevents a higher ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Coherent causal chain: glyph work → key chime → doorway → realization → key in arch → map. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration (the noon‑shadows’ destination) with a tidy loop‑closing image. Cost is light, mostly conceptual (foreclosing dormant potentials as the awakenings “rest”), keeping it below the highest tier. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds to the last vertebra set, the garden’s “inhale,” and the reweighted star maps (RR/CR closure). Because/therefore chains are minimal, but motif escalation is coherent and lands on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual—accepting the impossible while preserving skepticism—rather than dramatized. A small logic wobble appears when she pockets the tooth but the garden later “nurtures” its light.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density builds through repeated acts (weighing, polishing, arranging) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the final placement. Closure lands on the page when she completes the spiral and assumes the role of keeper of peaceful light. Cost is present but soft—more a renunciation than a price paid in scene. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why) and never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perception → ritual → activation → communal resonance. Orientation is crisp from the opening and a single continuous scene tightens via the icicle pattern leading to the interface. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the garden redefined as living archive and her grief reweighted. Cost is implied (risking the pendant, surrendering the confession to code), but not sharply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern (misted nexus, cameos, ritual) and tightens to a cadence shift as the mist thickens, the last cameo lands, the shell glows, and she closes the notebook—an RR (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) occurs on the page. Causality is lyric but coherent; the “current” resisting her words provides a tangible constraint. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual acts accrete toward the moonlit release and vow, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (remedy as reenacted memory). Orientation is clean early, and the final image reweights prior beats with the charged pollen and promise. Cost is implied in the binding vow and guardianship, though on‑page resistance is minimal. Causality is consistent within the ritual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual detail builds to the flare, binding, and a covenant that reweights the scene. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she binds herself to seasonal tending, with the felt price of ongoing devotion. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the linkage of beats is coherent. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds via observation → crystal substitution → hum → jar filling → reframed purpose, yielding a quiet but legible closure (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is crisp from the opening: who, where, season, object of labor. Cause-effect within its lyric logic holds: studying angles leads to the crystal solution, which leads to the echo-harvest. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the reconfiguration at the end makes a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds toward a cadence shift (final alignment, chime, feather placed, sunrise colors). Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration—burdens transmuted, grotto’s hush reweighted—though the cost is soft. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the ritual’s steps cohere causally within the story’s rules. One meaningful tightening occurs at the “final” alignment and chime.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The process of carving, alchemical sealing, and the kettle’s clock builds toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she reconfigures grief into a lantern and carries it out. Orientation is clean early; cause→effect is lyrical but coherent. Cost is conceptual—renouncing the roar for a quieter tool—felt in the final acts of placement and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through gathered fragments → spiral → rhythmic wheel → on‑page exchange. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon stills, a memory is traded, and Mara’s stance shifts with felt cost and a forward obligation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the recurring object channels the final cadence. No causality cheats; the price is paid in relinquished regrets and a bound vow.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative/textural dominance: the pattern of redirected flows → schematic revelation → equations → beacon forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/incipient causal change: the terminal lights, windows open, and a beacon signals outward. The cost is conceptual rather than felt—no trade‑off or sacrifice—softening impact. Orientation is solid early; single scene holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure thickens via hush, rain, and crystal whispers until the chime and breath reconfigure the premise from seconds to memories. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. Closure arrives on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (he keeps the dream; the sanctuary answers), though the price is primarily emotional and light. No causality breaks, just a quiet arc.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the barge → stuck lock → sundial alignment → dawn resolve forms a coherent progression. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he recommits with a reweighted understanding framed by sunrise and the radio’s silence. The physical turn (the lock opening) cleanly tightens the piece. Cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping this short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot‑reading → fulgurite activation → vow/vigil is a clear progression toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean early, and the fulgurite’s warming and vapor act as an on‑page pivot. Cost is present conceptually (accepting the weight of centuries and a future of listening), though not sharply dramatized. The final sign of the master weaver reweights stakes without breaking the quiet form.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs intensify toward a cadence shift when the rose revives and the shadows recede. Orientation is clean early (traveler, autumn garden, after the last ship), and the pattern holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: his “living obituaries” become maps that effect small healing, and he commits to the ongoing cost. The cost is present (endless solitary labor) though not sharply priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a mostly causal lens, the chain is clean: discovery → assembly and hypothesizing → placement → hatching → reconfiguration. Orientation is strong early, and the closure (phoenix emerges; covenant forged) lands on the page. The cost is soft—no sacrifice beyond labor and identity shift—so the ending reads as Resonant Reconfiguration more than Decisive Change. Still, the before/after is legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Operates under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual builds density toward a charged poise closure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the coin‑thread graft pays off as the reweighting act. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional—the acceptance of burden reframed—rather than dramatized sacrifice. The sunset → night → dawn cadence provides a coherent structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumb symbols, geese‑pause, and the box’s resistance build to the opening and the city’s exhale. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (memories freed; fountains reawaken) and a conceptual repricing of belief. Cost is light—patience and doubt yield without a concrete loss—which keeps it short of the highest band. Orientation is clean early, and the single‑scene structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses broaden, echoes return memories, and the final planting yields a filament rising—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what) and remains stable. Cost registers as a mourned refusal of fire and acceptance of a less visceral glow. The causal chain is lyric but coherent within the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers butterflies, ribbons, stones, and poems into a final reweighting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the ribbon resolves into a heart and he carves the rain-basin monument that embodies the town’s grief. The cost is conceptual—subsuming individual artistry into a communal pattern—present but soft. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the sequence coheres across the migration.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats accrete toward the pendulum’s reawakening and a pact-like closure. The decisive change is the resumed swing charged by the inscriptions, with a conceptual cost (lifelong, repetitive devotion). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). While the cost is more conceptual than visceral, the closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual builds to a conceptual repricing where intention becomes a circle/seed. Orientation is clean early (gardener, cemetery, silo at night), and the ritual proceeds coherently. Closure lands on the page through the final image of tending with the humming case; the cost is the chosen burden of remembrance, though it’s gentle. Structure stays within one continuous scene with a single dominant drive.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain: model → predictions → tactics → outcomes; the lens reads Causal and holds. Closure arrives via a Conceptual Repricing (“written before the pen met the blank page”) plus on‑world effects. Cost remains light and mostly implied, tempering the impact, but the structure coheres cleanly within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, when), and the accumulative/textural drive holds as density and communal attention build to the broadcast. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city receives song, dust now “tells its own tale,” and Mara embraces the conduit role. Causal threads (crackle → recognition → transcription → alignment → play) are coherent. The cost at closure is implied rather than explicit, keeping it strong but not peak.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: actions layer (entering, reading markings, incantation, alignment, crystallization, dissolution) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page with cost: she crystallizes the emotion, then dissolves the powder, foreclosing safety illusions. Orientation is clear early (gallery before dusk; singular POV) and the final image reweights prior material without causality breaks. The rocking chair’s stop and the vanishing point’s light function as cadence shifts that tighten the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: details accrue toward a conceptual repricing where competing narratives cohere and the protagonist chooses preservation of both. Orientation is immediate (sewer, sunken city, post‑plague) and the final image (cog ticking, sunrise) is earned. Cost is conceptual (giving up singularity for plural truths) rather than sharply dramatized, but closure still lands. Structure holds as one continuous scene with a tight throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is coherent and oriented early (velvet library, autumn, townspeople). Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: a communal shift toward reconciliation and an image of the rosette reflecting dim light. Causality is lyrical rather than mechanical but holds: music → loosening tension → shared participation → quiet afterimage. Cost is understated (implied ongoing labor), not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and celestial timing toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is firm within ~120 words (chef, greenhouse, alignment). Closure lands with the greenhouse transformed into a beacon and the vines’ neural foliage singing, though the cost is conceptual (pruning old ideologies) more than felt. The sequence of actions remains coherent without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: matchbox → key → hidden core → light cascade → drone → “Echo” → conceptual reframe of the hive failure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a charged final image (city’s echo returning, ritual renewed). Orientation is clear early; single scene holds. The cost is largely conceptual (loss reframed as pause), so the ending’s impact is strong but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the hush spreads, pattern density rises, and the final realization reweights the premise (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the object’s rules remain consistent. Closure lands with the narrator’s role redefined and the town’s rhythm altered. Cost is present but subtle (the “weight of silence” and ongoing responsibility), limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via revelations, culminating in a reconfigured garden and the statue’s declared fulfillment (a modest CR/RR). Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early (threading through a structural weakness) and reprises at the end. Closure lands conceptually but the on‑page cost is light and largely abstract. The beat sequence favors lyrical accrual over causal narrowing, yet remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds patterned pressure (rolls, equations, staircase responses) toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands with cost: he renounces the desire to reclaim a single missed chance and accepts a stabilizing flaw. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, and the pattern holds through the final image. The causal mechanics are suggestive rather than literal, but they cohere for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: night work → moon‑sparked reveries → note left → Jiro’s response → recommitment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Jiro’s remembering reweights Mara’s practice; the sunrise clock and her endurance supply modest cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The causal chain is delicate but coherent, with no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: bread → lens flash → amphitheater opens → communal reprise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a visible before/after (frozen culture to thaw), though the price is more implied than dramatized. Orientation is clean from the opening and maintained. The pattern teaches early and pays off in the final prism image without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under a predominantly causal lens, beats connect cleanly: yoyo cipher → energy conduit via hunger stone → engine initiation → beacon and post‑event echo. Structure is a single scene with a brief coda; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the lighthouse now guiding lost souls. Cost at the end is light (the stone’s dimming, solitude), which limits the potency of the closure. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when clear) with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative dominant: images and rules build, but causal beats link (gift → swallow → placement → flare → command → revelation). Closure lands as a Charged Poise: fear is exposed/dissolves and a costly option is offered (carry the luminance). Orientation is clear from the outset (abandoned carnival funhouse, post‑resuscitation). Cost is legible on the page though deferred (lifelong burden if she accepts the clasp again).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via density and cadence shifts (violet to amber to silver) toward a charged fade. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard hums, the prophet bows, then departs to repeat the mission. Cost is light and largely conceptual (expenditure and continuation without rest), so the finale lacks a palpable price on the page. Orientation is clean; single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: pattern study → mosaic crack → noon passage → light‑answer → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the expedition is the pattern; Mira vows to carry it forward). Orientation is clean, and setups pay off (whistle, noon light, watchers). Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene, clear orientation, and a coherent accumulative/textural drive culminate in a conceptual repricing: the noble lie dissolves and the station reconfigures around this shift. The because/therefore chain is soft but present (open box → read letter → environment responds → beacon declaration). Cost is faint; the transformation arrives without genuine hazard or a trade-off dramatized on the page. Closure lands, but the ease caps impact.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: arrival → descent/work → vow/withdrawal, with a Charged Poise closure. The final image reweights meaning (ink, notes, vow) and creates a before/after stance. Cost is implied (risk, endurance, self‑binding) more than on‑page decisive, limiting the ceiling. Orientation is crisp from the start; no causality breaks or untaught pattern shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    A clear causal line runs: hypothesis → council support → buoy illumination → cipher discovery → vault confirmation → civic shift. Closure lands on-page with a decisive reconfiguration (the charter’s confirmation, public protection), though cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a mild accumulative lyric weave and holds through the ending. No orientation debt; stakes remain coherent but rarely corner the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the noon‑shadow cue tightens cadence; density intensifies through polishing → cranes → basilica lift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: torment eases but persists, with a charged final image of cranes among stars and a golden basilica. Cost is legible on the page—the grief remains as “luminous torment,” not cured. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causality breaks occur.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of signals builds (visor lattice → glow → fissure → merge) to a Conceptual Repricing (“unused potential was not a place but a state”). Orientation is clean from the opening. Closure lands on the page with a felt shift and a charged final image (shards like “tiny suns”). The cost is subtle but present as a relinquishing of grief’s primacy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of star trails → lever → chip’s hum accrues toward a resonant reconfiguration: belonging reframed as a shared frequency. Orientation is clean early, and the causal path is legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a light cost (accepting guardianship), not a decisive change under pressure. The sequence lacks a complicating turn that would tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the causal thread holds: terrace → summons/envelope → shore/sifting → phrase/hum → return and repricing. Closure is on‑page (placing the watch hand and the wood’s hum) and the return to the terrace reconfigures the premise with cost. The cost is primarily conceptual/ethical, not dramatized through loss beyond internal surrender. Orientation is clean early, and the two‑shard structure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene coherence with a legible before/after: apology → offering → mutual agreement → release. Closure is on the page (they set prisoners free) with a felt emotional cost via renunciation of fear (the rope drop). Lens: Situational with accumulative texture; pressure coheres around the meeting’s moral stance. Minor logical wobble (moon-phase inconsistency) doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: image density and ritual action (launch, paddling, orienting by poles/compass) build to a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance with lingering cost). Orientation is strong from the first line and the single scene coheres. Closure lands on the page (“flickering faith settle into a steady ember”), though the cost remains mostly conceptual. A firmer on‑page price or complication would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clues → crate → mirror → renunciation, with the lake’s signals tightening the experiential arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the past becomes compass, the clean slate “rewritten,” and the lake’s brightening implies cost and effect. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality breaks. The price is emotional and symbolic rather than perilous, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: preparation → invocation → contact → metamorphosis. Orientation is immediate and stable; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a Decisive Change with a felt price and an earned final cadence of nightly tribute. Pressure is gentle and linear, but causality remains clean and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: tea set → crack → vapor staircase → droplet → anointment of twins. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the crack seals, a crystal blossom appears, and reclaimed time rains, with her personal release as cost. Orientation is early and steady; the causal thread is lyrical but legible. Minor softness: the success path is smooth, with few constraining “no” beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: stitching passes intensify until the seam “cracked like a sunrise,” a decisive on‑page change. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the pattern taught (lyric ritual escalating) pays off with a concrete gate opening. Cost is legible in the burden of sorrows and the ship left empty; the final placement of the crystal seals a before/after. Minor softness in tactical jeopardy prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: natural elements (volcano rumble, sparks, fisherman, prophecy) layer toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands with a conceptual repricing—Mara’s understanding shifts and guides future deeds. Cost is present (relinquishing the collection, surrendering control) though not searing. The pattern coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: sundial decoding → basement path → cradle activation → garrison’s mental shift. Closure lands on the page with a reconfiguration of the fort’s order, though the cost is mostly conceptual and risk is implied rather than dramatized. The accumulative lyric texture supports the causal beats without confusion; orientation is clear and consistent. Lack of turn/obstacle keeps the arc from a higher gear.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens through the rock‑placement pattern culminating in ignition and repricing of the curse. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when), and beats progress coherently toward the cadence shift when the tide “pauses” to listen. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her curse becomes a compass and the map remains. The cost is felt as burden and obligation more than loss, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ticking timer and storm intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration when the envelope opens and the storm softens. Orientation is clean from the opening stair to the observatory and maintained through the ritual. Closure lands on‑page with a conceptual price—the poet reweights sorrow into shared ritual—and the recurring objects are paid off. The cost remains more conceptual than felt loss, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure holds as one primary scene with a brief, legible evening return, and the pattern teaches early (angles, overture, waiting) then pays off when the sundial aligns with the needle card. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing as the overture is “sealed into a map.” Causality within the scene is coherent (coded angles guide tactics; final alignment triggers resolution). Cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting peak impact but not closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: tin → manifesto → seeds → shelves rebuilt → glow spreading, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (prison library at night; who/where/when). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change; the felt cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The chain is coherent, if low on hard turns.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images accrue toward a clear closure: the encore reconfigures fate/time, and the clock’s single tick then stop gives cost. Orientation is stable (station → tidal arbor → cloud auditorium) with one taught transition via the film reel. Setups (compasses, reel, night threshold) pay off causally enough for this mode. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: fate is “caught off guard,” compasses become stars, and time concedes a price.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: the translations intensify until the cadence shift at the incantation and sprout. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed wakes, the ridge exhales, and the monsoon’s approach leaves a felt cost/risk. Orientation is clean from the outset; stakes and method are taught early and paid off. The cost is conceptual/emotional more than enacted, but it’s legible in the final image and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterning (lace instructions, knots, compass quivers) coheres toward a resonant reconfiguration: the compass aligns, sorrow diffuses, and the tutor redefines the “color” as a feeling. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual price—letting go of regret—though the cost is gentle. Orientation is clear early and the throughline holds. The ending image (steady compass, cerulean sky) reweights prior motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a quiet, observant pressure that culminates in a strong Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where Mara reframes her entire scientific worldview, lands with a clear conceptual cost—the forfeiture of her dramatic, supernova-chasing ego. The structure is a clean, continuous scene, and orientation is handled perfectly, making the greenhouse a potent crucible for this change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through recurring imagery toward a strong Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The causal chain (fire -> ledger -> path -> mine -> new art) is simple but effective. The final image of the new kiln integrating the ledger strip provides a satisfying and earned reconfiguration of Elya's purpose with a clear felt cost (her prior life/work).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a single point of release. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Mara’s understanding of survival is re-framed as an act of creation. The cost—emotional vulnerability—is legible in her choice to activate the device, and the final image lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere until a resonant final image provides closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration of the library from tomb to sanctuary lands with a clear conceptual cost for Marlow. A significant flaw is the inciting incident—the "mysterious package"—which is introduced and immediately abandoned, leaving a causal loose end that feels like an artifact from a different plot.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the plot feels more like a summary of a successful operation than a dramatized narrative; events like "the first month of runs" are recounted rather than shown, which flattens the sense of progression and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure progresses through intensifying states of perception and action, from finding the tear to releasing its energy. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the love is released) and Resonant Reconfiguration (the world is healed), which lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—the dimming of Kwan Yin's tear. Orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with precision. Orientation is established effectively, and the narrative builds density toward a clear closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara achieves a new state of perception. The cost is legible and poignant—the literal dissolution of the photographs, representing static memory, is sacrificed to feel time as a fluid presence. The final image of the completed, glowing maze provides a powerful and earned sense of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure where each action logically enables the next, and it closes with a clear Decisive Change (the sprouting seed). However, the progression is too frictionless; obstacles like the puzzle and vault door are overcome without any significant setbacks, which lessens the impact of the resolution. The cost is largely symbolic (the crumbling carnival) rather than a price paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot progresses through a series of resonant images and actions, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's understanding is reweighted with a felt cost ("the orchard's memory imprint onto her own heart"). The structure is confident and perfectly suited to the lyrical concept.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a sequence of events toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the progression lacks causal tension; it's a linear sequence of unlocks without opposition, more of a guided tour than a plot. While the closure is legible, the journey to it is frictionless, weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates on a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood and meaning through resonant imagery. It's not a causal plot, but a structured meditation that culminates in a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure, where the control room is re-conceived as a "cradle for hopeful inquiry," lands with the felt cost of abandoning control for patience, making the ending earned and effective within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive. The plot is a series of because/therefore steps within a symbolic frame, leading to a legible on-page closure. The final act—stepping on the lever after accepting the vial's price—is a Decisive Change that solidifies a Conceptual Repricing of vulnerability. The cost is explicitly stated ("the betrayal of the self I had hidden"), satisfying the closure requirement. The plot's convenience (stunt moves perfectly matching the cipher) slightly weakens the structure but serves the story's metaphorical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere toward a clear trigger point. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the map dissolves into the air, is a powerful and resonant resolution to the central problem. The conceptual cost—that the endless night cannot be contained but only known ephemerally—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a single, coherent scene that builds pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure, where the robot's purpose is re-contextualized, lands with the tangible cost of the destroyed violin and the conceptual cost of its new awareness, fully satisfying the rubric's requirements for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a series of resonant images toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure lacks a clearly legible cost; the town is simply "freed" without any visible trade-off or price paid for this new state of transparency. This sense of an unearned, frictionless resolution weakens the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds pressure not through causal turns, but through a deepening of texture and awareness. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the garden acknowledges and "crowns" its keeper, is earned, on the page, and carries the felt cost of accepting the "weight of both bloom and rot." This is an excellent example of a non-causal plot structure achieving a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is expertly handled, building atmospheric pressure toward a resonant conceptual repricing at the climax. Closure lands with a clear, felt cost in the form of the paradoxical "icy warmth" that alters the station's state, making the before/after legible and earned under a textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the causal links are a chain of convenient discoveries—water damage that happens to form a code that happens to link to the program. The primary weakness is the lack of a clear, felt cost for the protagonist, which makes the otherwise legible closure feel somewhat frictionless and emotionally light.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic density toward a powerful close. The structure is a single, coherent scene that moves from a state of sorrow to one of resolve. The closure is an excellent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final image of the glowing illustration under the aurora re-contextualizes her internal burden, landing with a clear, felt cost and a shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing and Earned Stasis closure with a felt cost. However, the structure is significantly weakened by withholding the specific nature of the foreman's confession until a block of reflection near the end. This late reveal functions more as a retroactive explanation than an integrated discovery, flattening the narrative arc and making the climax feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively, with a clear progression from desire to fulfillment. The journey provides a steady intensification of the central textural element (silence). The closure, a form of Conceptual Repricing and Earned Stasis, lands with a legible, albeit positive, felt cost as the keeper’s thoughts "dissolve like ink in water."

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure effectively toward the eclipse. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "ordinary magic" for the community, lands cleanly. However, the final paragraph shifts into a summary of the future, telling the long-term impact rather than dramatizing it, which slightly weakens an otherwise solid single-scene structure by breaking from the established immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot executes a perfect Accumulative/Textural drive, building from textual clues to a physical test and culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The final realization that the axis shift is a "realignment, not a fracture" provides resonant closure with a clear conceptual cost—the acceptance of a world irrevocably changed. The causal chain of discovery is elegant and satisfying, with each step feeling earned.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building density towards its closure. The ending achieves a powerful Conceptual Repricing, reframing the fortune cookies as revolutionary tools with a clear on-page effect. The causality is one of discovery and implementation rather than conflict, which is appropriate for the chosen lens, and the structure is clean and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Pressure builds through the layering of sound, color, and concept, leading to a decisive, on-page closure where the "stillness shattered." The before/after state is legible, with the anchor's function reconfigured from a threat to a beacon, providing a strong sense of resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is a masterful execution of the Accumulative/Textural lens, building density toward a powerful cadence shift. Orientation is immediate, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where longing becomes a tool—lands cleanly on the page with a legible, felt cost ("exhaustion," the emotional burden repriced). This is a textbook example of a successful lyric structure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure holds. Orientation is clear, and the story builds density through recurring imagery. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's ascension and the tablet's dissolution provide a legible before/after state with a felt, albeit abstract, cost. Causality is metaphorical but consistent within its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a ritualistic sequence. The structure is tight, with a single continuous scene and clear orientation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marin's internal state is transformed, lands with a palpable felt cost on the page, successfully resolving the central problem within the story's unique logic.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The structure is sound for the length, but causality is soft; Elara "sensed a ripple in the air" to learn of the quarantine, which feels convenient rather than earned. While the closure lands effectively within its own logic, this initial leap requires significant suspension of disbelief and weakens the foundation of the central problem.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building sensory and emotional density toward a powerful close. Orientation is immediate and effective. The ending provides a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Arlen's understanding of grief and his own profession is reconfigured with a felt, universal cost, satisfying the closure requirement with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Working within an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is strong. The plot progresses as a spiral, deepening the central inquiry until the final choice. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the poet binds the rope to the grotto, paying the cost of sealing one memory to create another. This provides a legible before/after shift in the story’s central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds atmosphere and layers images to achieve a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where the "chronic hush" is conceptually repriced. The closure lands with a clear, earned shift in understanding, representing a felt cost of accepting incompletion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building density toward a clear point of transformation. The closure is a strong example of Charged Poise, crystallizing Mara's professional cycle. The final beat with the courier serves as a functional coda that reinforces this cycle, though it feels slightly convenient rather than a direct causal result of the grotto scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is simple and clear: a serendipitous discovery leads to a direct action, which blossoms into a community-level resolution. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "cargo" as compassion, lands with thematic weight, and the cost is the shared emotional burden of the boy's story. While the inciting incident is coincidence, it serves as an appropriate catalyst for this type of gentle, thematic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal turns but through a deepening of shared experience, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization that the tag is a living, growing symbol provides a legitimate before/after shift with a clear conceptual cost—the duty of continuous connection. The closure is earned and lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure is weakened by an ambiguous cost; the loss of the pendant is presented as a triumphant key, not a sacrifice with a felt price. While the final line hints at an ongoing quest, the lack of a clear, on-page consequence for the magic used slightly undermines the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, successfully building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing at its closure. The structure is clean—arrival, ritual, insight, departure—and the internal magical logic is consistent. However, the cost of the transformation is too conceptual ("a subtraction that made room for a new addition") and lacks a palpable, on-page price. While the final insight provides a resonant reconfiguration, the absence of a more clearly felt cost keeps it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere towards a resonant final image. However, a significant structural flaw damages causality: Maren finds the fragment and places it in a "secret cache," but then follows a resonance to a *different* room to place the fragment on a spindle. This sequence is confusing and breaks the logical progression of the plot, weakening the setup for the otherwise effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, leading to a clean Conceptual Repricing at closure. The structure is simple but effective for this meditative piece, and orientation is handled well. The lack of significant causal tightening prevents a higher score, but it executes its chosen quiet mode with structural integrity and a legible cost (the release of control).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is exemplary for this length. The progression from discovery to choice to a resonant final state is clear and impactful. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where her art becomes the island's memory, lands with a palpable, felt cost—the surrender of her past work. The causal logic remains mystical but is internally consistent and serves the thematic arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a sequence of resonant events toward a clear closure. The ending lands as a Conceptual Repricing where Lira's worldview shifts at the cost of her desire for foresight. The final beat with the pilgrim's return feels slightly superfluous, slightly weakening the cadence by over-explaining the effect, but the core structure and closure unit are sound.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and a mission rather than a causal plot. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist accepts a new, grander quest, is effective for this mode. However, the structure feels slightly overextended, moving from a self-contained scene into a summary ("Days turned into weeks") and then a final beat that feels like an inciting incident for a different story, weakening the piece's stand-alone integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot demonstrates exceptional structural integrity under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The causal chain of discovery—from punch to crack to door to ledger—is flawlessly executed within its fantastical logic. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, as the protagonist's understanding of the "fortress" and her role within it is fundamentally reconfigured with the felt cost of leaving her ordinary life. This is a sophisticated and well-earned ending.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds atmospheric pressure toward a resonant closure. The final image of the tower as a sanctuary is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a clear before/after state with a felt conceptual cost—the yielding of pure skepticism. The causality of experience is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through an intensifying sequence of sensory and conceptual phenomena, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the close. The final on-page action—whispering goodbye to his emptiness and stepping forward—provides a decisive change with a clear, felt cost, making the before/after state perfectly legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive that lands a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure. The structure is tight, holding a single scene and building pressure effectively toward the final magical act. The on-page resolution—the glowing equations dissolving bureaucratic rigidity—is a strong payoff for the setup, and the conceptual cost of transforming her father's legacy is legible. The story’s magical causality remains consistent within its established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    This story is an excellent example of an Accumulative/Textural drive executed with precision. The structure builds density toward a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the purpose of the "invented histories" is reweighted from a personal act to a communal one. The closure lands with a legible cost of patient perseverance, making the final image both resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building layers of observation that culminate in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization—that the protagonist's void-like identity is a conduit for the forgotten—lands with undeniable conceptual cost and re-frames the entire narrative. Causality is textural and coherent, with the tide's rhythm providing a natural, elegant structure for the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through resonant imagery rather than strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the central riddle, is clear and lands on the page with a legible conceptual cost—exchanging a fixed truth for an ever-changing one. The structure is a single, continuous scene that escalates smoothly to this final, resonant understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails structurally by presenting a plot summary rather than a dramatized scene, violating the single-scene/two-shard scope for this length. The causal chain (find chip -> organize artists -> reorganize city) is logical but compressed into exposition, which robs the narrative of immediacy and tension. The closure, while legible, feels unearned as the central conflict unfolds off-page, making the investors' swift defeat and the council's reversal feel convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is elegant and effective, building pressure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot adheres perfectly to the single-scene scope, using the sunrise as a natural clock. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where the act of photography redefines the grain's existence from a relic into a "captured breath of time," landing the emotional and conceptual cost with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the single scene builds pressure through sensory density rather than overt causal turns. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the final image of Mara turning back to her bench reweights her entire purpose with a palpable, if conceptual, cost—the promise of new horizons for others is built on her enduring sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot functions flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where a series of symbolic discoveries builds pressure toward a single, decisive action. The story establishes clear orientation and culminates in a perfect Charged Poise closure: "ready to record the first coordinates... a task both terrifying and hopeful." The cost is felt in her emotional state, making the final moment of potentiality resonate powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully, building the restoration beat by beat to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, the closure lacks a sharply defined, on-page cost. The tuner's 'patience' is a given, not a dramatized struggle, making the final achievement feel less earned than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from a critical continuity failure that undermines the closure. The vial "slipped from her hands, landing on the altar," but then inexplicably "glowed faintly in her satchel" as she surfaces. This logical break negates the cost of her sacrifice. Furthermore, the ending's causality is weak; how strangers who heard a distress signal would know about a specific perfume is unexplained, breaking the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective, building a lyrical and symbolic sequence toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with a legible, felt cost as the boy reframes his identity rather than escaping it. Causality operates coherently within the story's magical realist rules.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens perfectly. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the plot builds through repeated, resonant actions toward a definitive closure. The ending delivers a Decisive Change (the bride's disappearance) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard's transformation) with a clear, on-page cost—her existence—making for a powerful and structurally sound narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building its reality through layered imagery rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth is transformed—is legible. However, the cost of her actions is conceptually thin, and the final beat involving the humbled guildmasters is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the earnedness of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The structure is coherent, with orientation established early. However, the final change, while on-page, lacks a deeply felt or visible cost; Mara's "patient wandering" is presented as a virtue, not a struggle, which softens the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure builds density through a clear sequence of ritualistic actions, culminating in a resonant final image that provides closure (Charged Poise). While the causality is procedural rather than conflict-driven, it is coherent and the final "quiet assurance" lands as an earned moment of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's structure is elegant and perfectly suited to its Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot unfolds as a steady gathering of knowledge, culminating in a decisive action that feels both inevitable and earned. The closure is exceptional, landing with a tangible and resonant cost: the eternal flame, containing all untold stories, is spent and fades to ash, making the price of this one stitched truth clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, moving through a ritual with a meaningful deepening from the glass pane to the lagoon. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's understanding of apology is repriced. The cost—the release of long-held grief—is felt, and the entire sequence is coherent and well-paced for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure pivots effectively on the anesthetic, deepening the narrative pressure. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the symbolic "grafting"—which lands with a clear, felt cost in the "lotus-hearted ache," making the before/after state legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands, and the cost (the fragment dissolving) is on thepage. However, the plot lacks a meaningful tightening; the progression is a simple, positive sequence of events without any pressure or reversal that would test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds layers of imagery, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing at closure where the protagonist chooses curiosity. The cost—letting go of comfort and certainty—is explicitly stated on the page, and the final image provides resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a ritualistic atmosphere toward a clear closure. The ending, where Dr. Mirabel joins the cause and the rebellion expands, is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration. The inciting pressure is the arrival of Dr. Mirabel, which provides a meaningful tightening, and the cost is the expansion of the secret, which increases the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of layered images and intensifications, moving from a state of longing to a catalyst (postcard) and culminating in a resonant Conceptual Repricing. The closure, the "blossom armistice," lands with the felt cost of "centuries of longing" being transformed into healing, making the before/after state legible and earned within its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is built on a ritual that accumulates density and emotional weight, leading to a perfectly executed Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The traveler's arrival serves as a cadence shift that validates the caretaker's work, and the final beat—where her regret returns in a softer shade—lands with the palpable cost of acknowledging that her mission is endless. The closure is quiet, earned, and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot builds through a series of resonant actions toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where the silent archive becomes a “living chronicle.” The closure lands cleanly with a felt cost—the “weight of renewed covenant”—making the before/after state change undeniable and earned. Orientation is immediate and causality, within the chosen lens, is perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, and its closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the conflict finds stasis—is clear. However, the central causal link is critically weak; the discovery and instantaneous decoding of the adhesive-clue functions as a deus ex machina. This unearned leap of logic undermines the structural integrity, making the resolution feel pre-ordained rather than achieved through a coherent process.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands with a distinct felt cost—the fading of the meteorite's light contrasted with the persistent glow of her map—making the new balance tangible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building atmosphere and internal meaning toward a clear closure. The ending is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the child’s understanding and role are reconfigured with a felt cost—the relinquishing of his initial goal of escape for a new, sacred duty. The plot is elegant, coherent, and lands its final beat with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from entry to ritual to revelation. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Aria exits with an internalized understanding. The cost—the ephemeral nature of the communion ending at sunrise—is felt, providing a legible before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building pressure through layered discoveries rather than causal turns. The structure is coherent, moving from the arches to the fissure logically. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist’s understanding is repriced with the felt cost of accepting a bittersweet emotional state, making the final image of her stepping onto the bridge resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sequence of symbolic actions that cohere into a resonant final moment. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the chaos/order dynamic, lands effectively. The felt cost is the transient nature of the created moment, which the tide washes away, providing a satisfying, cyclical conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The progression from preparation to ritual to resonant aftermath is elegant and seamless. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration that redefines 'exile' as a 'conduit', lands with undeniable force, and the cost of permanent transformation is made beautifully legible in the final image of the night-bloom. The inferred drive lens holds perfectly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, with a single continuous scene that builds to a clear point of closure. Orientation is handled well, and the final image provides a Resonant Reconfiguration of the character's internal state. However, the closure lacks a meaningful, legible cost; the shift from "unsettled" to "lighter heart" is achieved without a tangible trade-off or sacrifice, which softens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building towards a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page as the box becomes whole through "collective understanding." However, the causality feels more magical than earned; the villagers' readiness to receive the lesson is convenient, weakening the sense that Maren's specific actions, rather than a pre-ordained magical event, produced the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building toward a Conceptual Repricing of the gauge. However, the closure is weakened by an overly tidy and summary-driven final paragraph. The discovery of hidden carvings that "confirmed that the mathematics of hope were etched into the world itself" feels like an unearned bonus that resolves all tension too neatly, diminishing the felt cost of the community's prior uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, layering discoveries to build toward a Conceptual Repricing of the central "legacy." The closure lands effectively, redefining the protagonist's burden. The structure is slightly weakened by the final section, which summarizes months of activity in an epilogue-like fashion, diluting the impact of the climactic moment of discovery and shifting into telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmosphere toward a clear closure moment. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirrors showing possibilities), which is on-page and fulfills the premise. However, the causality of the magic is vague, and the "cost" of the "borrowed heartbeat" is never felt, making the successful climax feel frictionless and less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. Structure is clear, with a single scene building atmospheric pressure toward the closure.

The structure is elegant and efficient, with a clear before/after state established for the "echo."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with precision. The structure is clean, building pressure through the intensification of the "chorus" of echoes. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of rebellion as a symphony, lands with a clear on-page cost (her disappearance), feeling both earned and resonant within the established lyrical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a single, focused scene that gathers symbolic weight (dishes, fire, hush) until it culminates in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where Selene redefines the puppet's string as a lifeline, is earned on the page with a clear conceptual cost: the forfeiture of authorial control, which forecloses her previous methods.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through the stages of a ritual, building emotional and atmospheric density toward a clear climax timed with the last monarch's passing. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Lira's final knot seals her commitment, and the cost of her solitary vigil is made palpable. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through the central ritual, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where the sanctum becomes a "living library." The closure lands with a clear "before" (doubt, silence) and "after" (purpose, chorus), and the arrival of the traveler provides a resonant final beat that confirms the change with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual rather than strict causality. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the "decaying directive" is rewritten on the page, creating a clear before-and-after state. The cost—the protagonist's curiosity becoming the catalyst for irrevocable change—is legible and ties the resolution directly to her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, successfully building atmosphere and context toward a single climactic ritual. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Nabu's modest accounting is bound to a cosmic ledger, is legible and lands with a felt cost of new responsibility. The structure is simple and effective for the length, with a clear before/after state for the city and the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building its effect through the repeated ritual with the monks and culminating in a resonant coda with the wanderer. The structure is clean and the internal logic, once established, holds. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the wanderer’s internal state is visibly changed with a legible cost—the dissolution of his anger and warrior identity—making the before/after state clear.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure effectively through the ritualistic sequence. The structure is a clean, single scene that moves from setup to a resonant conclusion without deviation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Arlen accepts a new guardianship, is clear and carries a felt cost of responsibility, landing with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic weight that charges the final resolution. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (mended lenses) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration of purpose, with the cost of the broken guild contract fully repriced. Causality is slightly weakened by the convenience of the "forgotten bag contents" appearing exactly when needed, which makes the solution feel less earned and more fortuitous.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a coherent progression from inquiry to revelation. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing that redefines knowledge, lands effectively and is consistent with this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot builds by gathering symbolic elements (door, seal, rope) and aligning them toward a single purpose. The closure—the door dissolving and the clock stopping—is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear, permanent cost ("the next tick that would never come"), making the before/after state starkly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and pressure effectively toward a single, decisive resolution. The plot is simple, clear, and perfectly scaled for the word count. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the cost of future vigilance ("continued his vigil...ever ready") made explicit and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building from a personal ritual to a communal responsibility. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose prompted by the caravan's arrival, is clear and lands with the felt cost of new burdens. The structure is clean, effective, and perfectly suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure, moving from observation to conjecture to a deepening insight, is elegant and effective. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the archivist's understanding of identity is fundamentally reweighted, and the conceptual cost—the dissolution of a singular self into a collective one—is legible in his final resolve. The prose artifacts in the final third prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building thematic and atmospheric density toward a resonant climax. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's wandering is re-contextualized as a purposeful mission.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot is the steady gathering of sensory data, which builds pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing of what "foretelling" means.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory and emotional density to a powerful closure. The structure is a simple, elegant journey that perfectly serves the internal arc. The ending provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, as Lio's internal state is transformed with a legible, albeit soft, cost—the ephemerality of the captured silences, which necessitates future journeys and preserves the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. The closure, an Earned Stasis, is achieved on the page as the passengers disembark with the "vaulting hush" and Lira's vial is "spent," signifying a completed, costly effort. The intensification point—the vial bursting into silver—provides a clear cadence shift that deepens the established atmosphere. The structure holds perfectly under its chosen lens, delivering a resonant final state.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean and logical Causal lens, with a clear setup, progression, and a Decisive Change at the closure. The plot mechanics are sound, and orientation is established effectively. However, the final cost of ascension—the "weight of histories" and the fading orchard—is presented but feels abstract and is immediately undercut by a "gentle hum of unity," slightly diminishing the felt price of the transformation and keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a state of charged isolation to a definitive reconfiguration of the narrative space. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the threshold becomes a bridge, lands with clear conceptual cost—the keeper's path is sealed by the "burning bridges," a choice made irreversible on the page. The internal, mythic causality is consistent and holds through to the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through an accretion of surreal details that justify the final choice. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing that transforms past trauma into literal value, is potent and lands on the page. The only minor weakness is the late, convenient appearance of the ex-accountant, which feels slightly too neat even for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with excellent coherence. The plot progresses through an intensification of sensory experience, from sound to vibration to pattern, leading to the discovery. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Lian's purpose is reconfigured with a legible cost—the loss of a heroic family myth. The structure is tight, and orientation is established immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The plot progresses through a sequence of atmospheric and symbolic actions that build density toward the climax. The structure is sound, moving from discovery to interaction to transformation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the knight binds himself to the orchard, is legible and lands with the felt cost of his former solitude. The causality is textural rather than strictly linear, which is consistent and effective for the story's mode.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through imagery. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Amelia finds a steadier purpose. However, the inciting incident—the button's magical ability to project stories—is asserted without causal grounding, feeling more like a convenient device than an earned discovery. The plot's second loop with the new file feels repetitive and lessens the impact of the initial, more powerful revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a resonant Charged Poise closure. The final image of Mara as a beacon and the key as a promise of return reconfigures the story's world with a clear, felt future cost—the "long battle" ahead. The poetic causality, particularly the puddle map, is internally consistent and serves the legendary tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, an Earned Stasis where the prophecy is quieted, lands effectively on the page with a felt cost—the weight of his ongoing duty. The brief backstory reflection is well-integrated, deepening the stakes without disrupting momentum. Causality is sound within its magical, atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building intensity through a series of discoveries. The structure is sound, with solid orientation and logical progression within its magical framework. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lira seals a pact with the forest, and the cost—her permanent transformation into a "bridge between root and sky"—is felt and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, where a sequence of discoveries builds to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Mara decides to build a new clock, is on-page and carries a clear conceptual cost (abandoning certainty). The structure is clean and effective for the length, though its reliance on a chain of convenient discoveries, even when named as "coincidence becomes pattern," slightly softens the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a valid Conceptual Repricing at its closure. The structure is clean and the orientation is immediate. However, the resolution lacks a legible on‑page cost; the alchemist’s regret is transformed into purpose and then gratitude, which feels more like a therapeutic re-framing than a price paid for her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sorrowful atmosphere that is effectively reconfigured at the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is legible on the page. However, the causal link at the climax—a clumsy joke instantly producing transformative, collective laughter—feels slightly unearned and simplistic, softening the impact of the otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The structure builds pressure through sensory and mnemonic density rather than causal turns, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure is on-page, the cost (enduring the "penance") is felt, and the final image provides a resonant reconfiguration of the story's core symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building atmosphere and memory toward a clear climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the narrator's role is redefined, lands with the felt cost of the fragment's dissolution. The structure is elegant and purposeful for this brief, lyrical piece, with all elements converging on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story builds a strong causal chain until the climax, where it collapses due to two significant logical failures. The sudden, unexplained appearance of an "elevator's control circuit" in a ticket office is an un-setup deus ex machina that violates the established world. Additionally, the confusing presence of two separate mainspring barrels muddles the mechanics of the resolution, obscuring the cause-and-effect that the rest of the story so carefully built.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a potent accumulation of imagery, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The final image of the reconfigured library, with the felt cost of the shattered "perfect system," provides a legible and satisfying closure that holds under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dispute dissolves. The closure lands with a felt cost—the acceptance of sorrow. However, the causality of the climax hinges on the phenomenon "after time becomes visible," which feels like a convenient, high-concept mechanism introduced without sufficient grounding, weakening the otherwise elegant structure by making the resolution feel more magical than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot is exceptionally well-structured. It establishes the problem, builds atmospheric pressure toward the midnight deadline, and delivers a clean Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure. The final image of the restored light provides a legible before/after state, and the conceptual cost—the ongoing need for truth—is established and carried through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a sequence of resonant images rather than strict causality. The structure is flawless for this mode, moving from the quarry to the lagoon’s core in a single, continuous scene. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing where Mara’s goal is re-framed, with the loss of the compass and her old quest serving as a legible cost. The magical logic is internally consistent and serves the final thematic turn perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery rather than plot twists. The structure is clean, moving from a single catalytic scene to a resonant coda. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts her role in an endless creative process, lands clearly with a felt cost—the peace she finds is not an end, but a recommitment to a perpetual journey.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere that culminates in a resonant closure. The structure is a clean two-shard sequence (pavilion-cathedral-pavilion), and the final image provides a Conceptual Repricing of the central question with a clear felt cost (shedding "cold doubts"). A minor but distracting continuity flaw—the mention of "autumn’s amber scent" during the last snow melt of winter—prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a clear Causal lens, and the closure is a decisive, on-page change. However, the structure feels like a rapid summary of a much longer story, compressing key events ("She negotiated a parley," "She spent nights...") into single sentences. Major plot devices, like the "retrocognitively trapped" diary, are introduced as complex locks but are resolved with convenient, unexplained keys, weakening the story's internal logic and sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes its accumulative/textural structure with precision. The plot builds through a coherent intensification of mental effort, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the town's revival is achieved at the cost of the alchemist's ongoing duty. Orientation is immediate, and the closure is both earned and resonant within its established, non-causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail rather than strict causality. Orientation is established immediately, and the structure moves cleanly from inciting incident (hearing the prophecy) to a final Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands on the page, redefining the prophecy's meaning and Harel's purpose with a clearly felt cost ("the prophecy’s weight settle like dew on his shoulders").

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure is a single, continuous ritual that builds in intensity toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, where Mira understands her new role and plants the seed, lands with a felt cost—the surrender of her individual present to a vast lineage. The causality is atmospheric and symbolic, which is perfectly executed for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and effective for the chosen Accumulative/Textural lens, building quiet tension toward a satisfying closure. The final image of the bell's new tone serves as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration of the sanctuary's purpose, with the cost legible in the retirement of the old rope "like a retired hymn." All causal links are clear, and the single scene unfolds with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. The narrative builds density through layered imagery, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where the janitor's vow elicits a response from the station and the ground, lands with a felt cost of emotional empathy. The plot is internal, but its cadence shift—from quiet observation to a binding promise and cosmic response—provides a satisfying and legible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot functions exceptionally well under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a resonant conclusion. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the recluse's role, lands with a clear on-page image (the amber tear) that carries the felt cost of his choice. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's aims and length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, successfully building toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end where the silo's function and the nature of time are redefined. The structure is coherent and the final image of the time-thread map is strong. The score is limited because the closure lacks a clearly legible cost on the page; the initial stake of Mara's "borrowed-time" is resolved with a seemingly consequence-free epiphany, softening the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood through recurring images rather than a causal chain. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "incompleteness," is achieved. However, the structure suffers from severe looping; the central sequence of observation, disruption, and reflection is repeated multiple times with slight variations, which reads less like intensification and more like narrative stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere effectively towards a final reconfiguration. However, the closure is weakened by an unearned resolution. The council's instantaneous reversal of a life-or-death decree feels convenient, and the cost of Mara's impending doom is averted without a clear, on-page price, undermining the stakes established at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully executes an Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory density towards a clear climax. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing, where the nature of "homecoming" is redefined with a tangible cost (the amber dimming). The structure is sound for its chosen mode, coherently linking the accumulated elements to the final resonant image of the tower's inner light.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story's structure is flawless for its length and aims. Orientation is immediate and effective, and the plot progresses through a series of resonant images. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the battlefield as a garden of peace, lands with palpable conceptual cost rooted in the memory of war and the death of the reef, making the final moment of renewal feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Rook accepts his renewed purpose with a felt cost. However, the plot's causality is weakened by convenience; the path to the climax is entirely frictionless, with the chest even being "rusted open." While not requiring opposition, a stronger sense of challenge would make the closure feel more significant.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, structuring itself around two resonant shards that build to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure, where the protagonist reaffirms their pilgrimage with a new understanding of "true north," is earned and legible. The felt cost is the acceptance of a lonely, uncertain path, which lands effectively in the final lines. The structure is elegant and well-suited to the story's reflective nature.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and effective, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot builds through a series of methodical actions to a Decisive Change—the cracking of the frost—with a legible, if subtle, cost in Lysander's redefined social role. The piece establishes its stakes, follows its own logic, and delivers a resonant on-page closure without deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with excellent control. The structure is a simple, effective ritual that builds symbolic weight toward a resonant closure. The final image of Mira accepting her mission provides a clean Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost (“the weight of those gestures”). The magical-realist causality of the walking pattern unlocking the chessboard works perfectly within the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory and emotional intensification rather than causal plot turns. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where Lira redefines "home" as a portable "resonance," not a place. The cost is legible on the page—confronting the "fractured recollections" and the pain that "shattered like glass"—which directly enables her final, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through symbolic encounters within the labyrinth. The structure is clean and purposeful, moving from external setting to internal crucible and back. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist lets go of his guilt, is earned on the page with a clear "before/after" state, and the cost of releasing that defining pain is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building pressure through layered imagery and sound toward a legible closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the "forged hush" to "resonant peace" with a clear conceptual cost ("acceptance of loss," "shared memory"). The structure is confident and well-suited to the story's lyric aims.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. It builds atmospheric and internal pressure toward a clear cadence shift and a legible closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, as the alchemist's internal state is transformed and the world around her responds, with the cost being the surrender of fear. The before/after states of doubt and resolve are well-defined and the change happens on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the central causal link is critically soft. The discovery of a key—specifically for a chest the protagonist painted and hid himself years ago—in a randomly discovered cave relies too heavily on magical coincidence rather than earned causality. While the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, this central convenience weakens the structural integrity of the plot leading up to it.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail toward a clear closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as the fisherman's arrival validates Mara's actions, reweighting the central premise with the felt cost of her emotional vulnerability. The structure is tight and focused, perfectly suited for the story's length and delivering a satisfying final image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of traditional causal plotting, it builds pressure through a dense layering of imagery and concept. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ships' arrival confirms the success of her project—lands with a clear felt cost, representing the absorbed sorrow. This structure perfectly serves the lyrical, melancholic premise, and the final image reweights the entire piece from a story of loss to one of hopeful return.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story executes a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end, and the causal chain (involuntary truth -> smuggler realization -> new social contract) holds. However, the smugglers' rapid change of heart feels under-motivated, softening the climax's impact. Furthermore, the extensive front-loading of backstory and world-building delays the story's present-tense anchor well beyond the 120-word mark, weakening initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The main structural weakness is the central investigative method—reading memories in the tide's gaps—which feels like an unearned poetic leap. While fitting the tone, this conceit strains causality and makes the pivotal discovery feel more magical than earned through observation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure under a Causal lens. The inciting incident (finding the chip) leads directly to the climax (opening the doorway). The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is valid and earned by the on-page action, though the cost is purely internal. The final two paragraphs function as a denouement that feels slightly appended, explaining the change rather than letting the climactic image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building pressure toward a clear on-page closure (a Decisive Change in the queen's state). However, the causality within the grotto feels overly convenient, like a sequence of prescribed steps rather than organic discovery. The final cost—a new vow of watchfulness—is legible but lacks immediate, visceral weight, softening the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building a sequence of resonant actions toward a clear closure. Orientation is handled well, and the single-scene structure is clean and appropriate. The ending achieves a Conceptual Repricing, as the creation of the light and the shared vow redefines the purpose of their alchemy, establishing a clear before/after with a felt, if not costly, commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a state of mind through associative links. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the grave's meaning shifts from an endpoint to a "marker for the stories I have yet to tell," landing with a clear, felt cost—the acceptance of lost innocence. The structure feels purposeful and effectively supports this final reinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds a potent atmosphere that intensifies toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where Lena's internal state is solidified and affirmed by the external world. The closure—the sunrise and the sight of the mother and child—lands with earned resonance, making the "before/after" of her understanding legible with the felt cost of her sensory loss.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a single, continuous scene effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where scars are re-coded as stories, lands with a legible cost—the shedding of past pain. The structure is clean, and orientation is immediate and strong, with the narrative pressure building steadily through atmospheric and symbolic density toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, structuring the plot as a cohesive ritual. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a clear conceptual cost—the orchard’s destruction and the apology’s uncertain reception—making the "imperfect miracle" feel earned. Causality, though magical, is internally consistent and serves the narrative well.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with exceptional coherence. The ritualistic plot structure builds pressure effectively toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure lands decisively on the page with a legible cost—the protagonist's own dissolution ("vanished like a breath of wind")—making the transformation of reality feel earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building pressure through sensory detail and reflection. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where the shepherd's understanding of his task is fundamentally reweighted. The cost—the dissolution of his paradoxical quest for a "line" into a feeling of "agreement"—is subtle but legible, making the ending earned and satisfying under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and concept effectively. Orientation is clear, and the storm provides the single required tightening that tests the protagonist's system. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is achieved, but its impact is slightly dulled by the story's tendency to explain its own themes just before the end. The core causal chain (new system -> storm test -> success) is sound for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot follows a clear causal A-to-B-to-C puzzle structure, which is functional. However, the closure—Mara’s epiphany and new theorem—feels unearned. The connection between traversing the tunnels and achieving this profound insight is asserted ("each intersection corresponded to a lesson") rather than demonstrated. The story lacks a legible cost; the "clover melancholy" is an ambient mood, not a price paid for the knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly for its length. The plot advances through the layering of experiences onto the disc, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where "cultivated estrangement dissolved, replaced by a quiet communion," is a decisive, on-page change with the felt cost of Mara’s founding philosophy. The final image of her stepping out of the booth solidifies this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is a simple, elegant ritual: arrival, preparation, action, and completion. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the archivist's task is done for the night, the covenant is renewed, and the promise settles on him. The felt cost is his endless vigilance and the bittersweet weight of his purpose, which the final lines convey. The plot is slight but structurally sound for its lyrical aims.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where the cure is redefined as the act of connection itself, lands with a clear conceptual cost: Lira must give the object away to sustain the cure. The structure is elegant and purposeful, with every element serving this final, resonant reconfiguration of the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building sensory detail toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The structure is coherent, and the orientation is established well. The closure lands on the page, but the "cost"—the dissolution of languages into one chord—is abstract and lacks a visceral price, slightly softening the impact of the before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere rather than strict causality. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chaotic data is restored to order, provides a clear before/after state. The felt cost is legible as the lifting of the "lingering uncertainty," making the final stasis earned and meaningful within the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    The two-shard structure is functional, but the closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration via Lira's arrival, is critically damaged. The cost is a vague emotional state ("joyful sorrow") and the final authorial sentence explains the story's magic, collapsing resonant mystery into a flat summary.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a Hybrid (Causal -> Accumulative/Textural) lens and achieves a strong Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure. The primary weakness is the central causal chain; the vandalized self-portrait becoming a "map" is a significant logical convenience that isn't dramatized, making the puzzle-solving feel more mechanical than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building emotional and sensory pressure toward a clear resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the garden's sorrowful state shifts to one of quiet hope, is on the page. The weakest link is the slightly unearned leap from the garden's transformation to the lab staff's change of heart, which is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the causal impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates on a clean and effective Causal lens, with each event logically precipitating the next. The structure is impeccable for its length, moving from setup to a clear climax and resonant closure. The final Conceptual Repricing, validated by the parchment, provides a satisfying resolution, though a more palpable on-page cost for Milo would have elevated it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is superb. The story builds pressure through patterned action, culminating in a clear closure unit: a Conceptual Repricing where the "darkness" is altered. The cost—sustained, deep patience—is felt, and the fisherman's reaction provides external validation of the change, making the quiet ending feel fully earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story masterfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery rather than direct causality. It culminates in a strong Conceptual Repricing closure, where the town’s relationship with "quiet" is fundamentally revalued, a change made legible in the final collective actions.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure builds through a sequence of resonant images—whale call, rising island, glowing crystal—leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist. The magical causality is consistent within its own rules, and the closure, Mara's changed internal state, lands with the felt cost of releasing her past (the scrimshaw).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure through atmosphere and recurring imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the concept of "hush" is redefined. The closure lands with a clear, albeit quiet, felt cost—her continued solitude—and the final image of the baton and flowers provides a potent, earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Structure builds from a quiet opening to a resonant climax without a single wasted beat, holding the lens consistently. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands with a legible conceptual cost ("old prohibitions folding"), creating a powerful before-and-after state.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through a series of resonant images and "bartered awakenings." The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, with the final image of the glass garden providing a conceptual repricing of Selene's quest. The cost—accepting her flawed vision as a unique mode of perception—is legible and earned through the preceding sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds sensory and emotional density toward a clear closure: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the artificial mind's "soft sigh" confirms a new state of connection. The cost is the bell ringer's commitment to this perpetual, gentle ritual. The plot is simple but coherent, and the final image of earned stasis is both legible and resonant within the established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Causality operates through symbolic resonance, building from the stencil to the cranes to the climactic revival of the rose. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into a state of Charged Poise, lands with the felt cost of processed grief, beautifully captured in the final image of the crane pointed toward a new sunrise. The structure is tight, elegant, and serves the internal arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Pressure builds not through causal turns but through an intensification of pattern and meaning, culminating in a resonant Conceptual Repricing where her work is redefined. The final image of the droplet on the tape provides a perfect, on-page closure with a felt cost of newfound purpose and responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through an intensification of atmosphere and sensory detail, leading to a strong on-page closure. The ending delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing of "purification" with a legible felt cost, making the before/after state change undeniable. The 9+ gate is disallowed by prose issues in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story builds effectively through an Accumulative/Textural lens, leading to a potentially resonant closure. However, a significant causality break severely damages the final sequence: the protagonist "returned the river stone to its pedestal," only to be described in the final paragraph as walking out with "the river stone cradled against his chest." This contradiction muddles the final action and undermines the otherwise earned sense of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the accumulative structure serves the story's mood, the central symbolic plot action is causally incoherent; releasing the tail tip into the air only to immediately retrieve and reattach it breaks the internal logic of the magical act.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear, if symbolic, Causal-Hybrid lens, where each discovery logically enables the next step of the ritual. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change in the protagonist's internal state, coupled with a Conceptual Repricing of time and healing, and it lands with the felt cost of a long-sought peace. The structure, moving from tower to tunnel and back, is slightly busy but serves the ritualistic progression without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot is exceptionally well-structured. The narrative builds density through a seamless cascade of events: the psychometry, the labyrinth, the discovery of the box, and the final liquid light. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's understanding of her quest is transformed, landing with a clear conceptual cost—the burden of incubating sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a simple, effective ritual: setup, deepening action, and climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the dreamer's internal state is resolved and the archway is permanently altered, with the cost of extreme fatigue ("sank to the cold floor") made tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds from stasis to a decisive, resonant conclusion, with the clock's first tick and the appearance of light-trunks providing a clear "after" state. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of the guard's purpose and a Decisive Change in the world, lands with the felt cost of his continued, lonely vigil. Orientation is immediate and the pacing is expertly controlled for a short, lyrical piece.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sequence of resonant images that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing. While the structure holds and the closure lands, the symbolic causality linking the gear, translocation, and engine feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a coherent emotional and symbolic arc. The structure is clear, moving from pier to ferry to cave, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Mira redefines courage. The closure lands effectively, establishing a clear before/after state with the felt cost of leaving her old life behind, which is sufficient for this lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive lens well, building pressure through imagery and symbolic action rather than a causal plot chain. The closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the guests' understanding of safety is reconfigured with a felt cost—the acceptance of silence. The central beat, where the bolt activates the step, provides a meaningful deepening that serves as the story's structural pivot, making the final realization feel earned within its symbolic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal lens is held perfectly. The plot progresses through a clean because/therefore sequence: the rune requires the pellet, the pellet creates the map, the map leads to the crown, and touching the crown triggers the climax. The closure is a Decisive Change, with the pretender vanquished and the truth revealed, landing with the clear, on-page cost of the temple's collapse. The structure is flawless for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot succeeds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering data and imagery to build toward a powerful final discovery. Orientation is clear, and the sequence of events is logical.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with a well-defined closure unit (the embryo's unsealing) and an on-page cost (the memory sacrifice). The structure is sound for the length. The primary weakness is the inciting incident's reliance on coincidence—the kite with the exact key to the relic appearing "tangled among the geysers" feels overly convenient and lessens the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building emotional density toward a clear closure. The final moment of resolve is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where her internal stance shifts with a felt cost. The structure is clean for its length, moving from observation to confrontation with the memory (the photo) to a final, forward-looking stance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building psychological pressure that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elian accepts fragmentation as his canvas, is earned by the preceding descent. The symbolic causality is tight, with the interaction with broken objects directly leading to a shift in perspective and a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building a sequence of resonant images that lead to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("the price of oblivion"), re-weighting the initial mystery as a sacred duty. The narrative is a single, focused, and coherent scene that adheres perfectly to its chosen lens and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly constructed with a clean, causal drive that holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the closure. The story lands a decisive change—the start of the "unspoken conversation"—with a clearly legible cost to the established order and a personal risk to the protagonist. For its length, the structure is flawless, moving from a single action to a society-level reconfiguration with convincing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive exceptionally well. The plot isn't causal, but rather a sequence of symbolic actions that build thematic density and lead to a resonant conclusion. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the survivors transition from scattered individuals to a cohesive community, with the past's weight (sandbags, tower) reconfigured as a foundation for the future. The cost is the full acceptance of that painful history.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds sensory and conceptual density toward a well-defined climax, "the instant when patterns break themselves." The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the fisher internalizes the echo, redefines his purpose from catching to releasing, and the final image lands with a palpable sense of transformation. The magical causality is internally consistent and the cost—a dissolution of self into a universal song—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal structure from inciting incident to a Decisive Change at the climax. However, the resolution relies on a 'magic key' mechanism where the console conveniently recognizes the pen nib's lineage and deciphers a rhyme. This convenience softens the plot's impact, making the victory feel predetermined rather than earned through overcoming specific, dramatized obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lab's purpose shifts and Lyra finds peace. The closure lands with a felt cost. The primary weakness is the convenient discovery of the handwritten letters, which feels like an unearned key that weakens the causal integrity, even within a lyrical structure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the grotto's atmosphere is changed. The closure for Liora's arc is clear and costed. However, the final paragraph introducing the violinist feels like a tacked-on coda that breaks the established structural and narrative focus, slightly weakening an otherwise coherent design.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. The story establishes a broken world and moves toward a single, decisive moment of Conceptual Repricing—the renaming of the plaza. The closure lands clearly on the page ("the minaret mosaic tessera pulsed, releasing a cascade of light that stitched the broken sky") with a legible, if subtle, cost (a calm that is "soothing and stark"). The causal logic is symbolic rather than physical, but it remains consistent within its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens well, building a dense, resonant atmosphere. The closure, a combination of Earned Stasis for the ghost and Conceptual Repricing for the world, lands with a clear cost. The central flaw is a causality break at the climax: the tarot coin teleports unexplained into the shopkeeper's hand, and her wish—not a final act from the protagonist—resolves the core problem, undermining the established narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear accumulative structure from inciting incident (static shock) to a well-defined Conceptual Repricing at the close. The closure lands on the page when the "faint whisper of another mind" confirms her theory, creating a legible before/after. However, the final confirmation arrives conveniently from an unexplained external source, softening the causal integrity of her breakthrough and feeling less earned than if it were purely a result of her own internal mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building pressure through a ritualistic intensification of a single event. The closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's understanding of her purpose is transformed. The cost is legible in the fossil drifting away, becoming an oracle for others at the price of her personal tool, though its emotional weight is slightly muted.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where poetic logic replaces strict causality. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands decisively on the page with the sand bridge, providing a strong before/after state change with a conceptual cost (potential becoming reality). The plot's internal rules are consistent and satisfying within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, where a ritualistic sequence builds narrative pressure. Orientation is swift and effective, and the structure is clean. The closure unit is strong, landing a Conceptual Repricing (courage is a state, not a place) that enables a Decisive Change (entering the pass) with a clear, felt cost—the dissolution of past ties.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a single, coherent scene that builds pressure through atmosphere and waiting, culminating in a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, triggered by the cessation of the rain gutters' ticking, provides a clear "before and after" state for the protagonist's internal burden, landing with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory details like the intensifying "thrum." The structure is a clean, single scene leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the oasis state is visibly changed on the page. While the conceptual cost—accepting brokenness as a form of protection—is slightly abstract, it's legible in the final image, making the closure strong and earned under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Following an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound and effective. The narrative arc is a single, continuous deepening of atmosphere, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "quivering hush" settles into a "steady breath." The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the promise of ongoing care—and the final image of the glowing harbor reweights the initial sense of unease into one of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure successfully builds atmospheric density toward its climax. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, repricing the story's core concepts. However, the plot relies on a key event—the "reincarnation memory"—that appears without any setup, functioning as a convenient trigger for the climax rather than an earned development, which slightly undermines the causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts her role, lands on the page with a felt, conceptual cost—the surrendering of private secrets to a communal chorus. The magical logic remains consistent, building through sensory details to a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The central causality—interference creates a unifying hum that alters the community's response—is clear and elegant. The final image of the valley thrumming with a shared pulse provides a costly and earned Conceptual Repricing of the initial conflict, marking a truly publishable structural success.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The plot follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a sequence of resonant images toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands, repricing the key's purpose. However, the spatial logic of the ending is confusing: the explorer emerges "into the starlit night" but then uses the key on the altar—which was inside the cavern—to open a door "behind him." This geographical inconsistency at the story's most crucial moment of transition undermines the otherwise clean structure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where emotional and atmospheric density leads to a climactic shift. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively with the quarry cracking open to reveal the names. However, the causality feels somewhat convenient; the quarry's direct response is a magical solution that, while tonally consistent, lessens the sense that Mara's specific actions, rather than just her heightened emotional state, earned the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the plot's momentum is significantly harmed by summarizing the pivotal moment of rallying the crew. The line "She rallied the crew, explaining..." compresses a crucial scene of persuasion and leadership into a single sentence, weakening the causal chain that leads to the collective action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. Causality is magical, not mechanical, but the internal logic holds from the setup (legend of the amnesty) to the climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the fiddler's purpose is reconfigured with a felt cost ("the weight of the moment settle like ash in his hands"), landing cleanly on the page. Orientation is established immediately and the structure builds effectively to its resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure, using an Accumulative/Textural lens to navigate the startup's rise and fall, is highly effective for this length. The closure is excellent, landing a powerful Conceptual Repricing on the final page ("circles are not failures but the universe’s method of testing") with the felt cost of the startup's collapse. This reconfiguration of the story's central premise is both earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic connections that lead to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page, repricing Mara's solitary task as a shared cosmic contract. The structure is sound and well-suited for the story's lyrical, puzzle-solving nature, with a tangible before/after in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    The plot functions well under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands effectively, with the lake's transformation providing a clear before/after state. However, the story is significantly flawed by its opening, which introduces a failed magic trick and onlookers, elements that are immediately abandoned and have no causal link to the druid's ritual, feeling like a disjointed fragment from another story.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length and Accumulative/Textural lens. The single, continuous scene builds pressure through deepening knowledge rather than external events. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, as the visionary ignites the beacon and accepts her role, providing a clear before/after with the felt cost of her new, binding duty. The story's internal logic is consistent and elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of resonant actions that build density toward the closure, which lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing of the initial pact. The cost is legible, and the final shift in understanding is earned by the on-page ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory details and internal reflection. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist redefines his relationship with "applause" and purpose. The final image of using the speaker cloth for the record player provides a resonant, on-page reconfiguration with a clear felt cost—the relinquishing of an old identity for a new one.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of the character's purpose. The closure—a decision to test the seed in a new environment—is a decisive change with the felt cost of leaving a place of power. The structure is a clean, continuous scene with a well-defined before and after state for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens. The inciting incident ("after tomorrow disappeared") creates a clear situational pressure that is resolved through a symbolic act. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the librarian's purpose shifts from static preservation to enabling active, ongoing creation. The cost—the forfeiture of his stable, unchanging identity—is legible and deeply resonant with the story's core themes. The structure is elegant and effective for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully, building atmospheric and emotional density towards its closure. The structure is simple but effective: descent, discovery, ritual, and reconfiguration. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara accepts her new role, with the cost being the dissolution of her former, detached self. All elements cohere to produce a satisfying, if quiet, conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure, moving from station to graffiti to tunnel to river, builds emotional and thematic density toward a clear closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the protagonist crystallizes a new path, with the felt cost being the acceptance of an ongoing pilgrimage rather than a final cure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sequence of discoveries that lead to a coherent closure. The final image of the garden provides a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, resolving the central quest on the page. The implied cost—the new responsibility to document the "petals"—is legible, making the ending feel earned within its own mystical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in the final scene. However, the closure—a Decisive Change—suffers from weak causality. The envoy's instant capitulation based on a song and a shared feeling of grief undercuts the empire's established threat, reading as a convenient resolution rather than an earned outcome. The cost is stated ("mulberry ache") but not sufficiently dramatized in the antagonist's reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands with precision and legible cost: the emerald flares as a beacon of preserved light while the aurora itself "dimmed a fraction, as if acknowledging the transfer." This creates a powerful before/after state, reconfiguring the balance of light in the universe with a clear, felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a central ritual. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "contentment," lands clearly. However, the structure is significantly weakened by a protracted denouement that summarizes future events (the storm, the next harvest), diluting the power of the core climactic moment in the grotto and making the ending feel less resonant and more like an epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It establishes a state of certainty, builds pressure through resonant images (chimes, shard, knot), and culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing where nuance is welcomed. The closure lands with a palpable, re-contextualized cost—the forfeiture of certainty—and the final image reconfigures the story's meaning without needing a causal plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) for its closure, landing a resonant final realization with a clear conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens is established early and held consistently, with patterns of imagery building pressure toward the climax. The structure is clean, moving from platform to grotto in two distinct, well-anchored shards that serve the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively, building sensory and conceptual density toward its closure. The final moment—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist achieves Earned Stasis by navigating internally—is clear and lands with a felt cost of renouncing physical movement. The progression is not causal, but the intensification of knowledge and perception is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through mood and recurring imagery toward a clear closure. The ending delivers a potent Conceptual Repricing, where the value of Selric's "underachieving" magic is redefined. The cost—letting go of external validation—is felt and legible, making the internal change resonate powerfully. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page as Eli's quest is reconfigured into a new, larger one. The primary weakness is the causal link for entering the library; the riddle's solution ("he must hide behind truth—his own unspoken oath—to signify the path") is asserted through exposition rather than dramatized, feeling like a convenient logical patch.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate, and the narrative builds density toward a clean closure. The ending is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the meaning of "purpose" is reconfigured with a felt cost—the acceptance of doubt—which is made legible on the page without resorting to a physical climax.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and magical intensity through a sequence of resonant actions. The structure is elegant: discovery, ritual, release, and personal apotheosis. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira’s grief is transformed into a bridge, lands with palpable cost and clarity, fulfilling the story's promise beautifully. The causality is lyrical yet mechanically sound within its established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully, building pressure through the patient assembly of the bell. Orientation is immediate and closure is definitive, with the fish returning in a resonant final image that confirms the Decisive Change. The magical causality is soft but internally consistent, making the structure a solid foundation for the lyrical concept.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive, culminating in a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) at closure. The structure is elegant, but the central investigation unfolds through summary rather than a dramatized, causal sequence of actions. The town's acceptance is frictionless, which softens the sense of a hard-won victory, though the final emotional cost lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a coherent ritualistic sequence that orients the reader effectively. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Selene's internal state, lands clearly on the page. The score is significantly limited by the absence of a legible cost; the transformation is presented as a pure gain, a "promise fulfilled," which undermines the weight of the achievement and prevents the ending from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the Earned Stasis closure is legible. The core failure is a significant causality break: the protagonist repairs a parachute buckle, and this somehow causes a distant radio to begin working again. The line "his revision had been heard" presents this as a magical or symbolic connection, which fundamentally undermines the plot's mechanical logic and the stakes of the physical repair.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene causal structure. The inciting incident, rising action, and climax are logically linked, leading to an on-page Decisive Change with a clear cost (the shattering of the old status quo). The lens is consistently Causal, and the closure is strong, though the final paragraph introducing a new character slightly diffuses its focus.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through a series of solved riddles that culminate in a single, resonant event. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bloom), provides a powerful final image that validates the entire setup. The causality is procedural (solve cipher -> open vent) but holds together perfectly for this concept-driven piece, and the "cost" is legible as the creative risk Mara undertakes.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory intensification rather than linear causality. The structure is coherent, moving from ritual preparation to a clear climax and resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the house's emotional state is altered, lands with a felt cost as the conductor's purpose is fulfilled and he vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story's structure is flawless. The inciting incident (pendant) smoothly intensifies the guardian's core dilemma, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure. The final image reconfigures the character's role and the setting's function with a clear, legible cost—the sacrifice of "fragile order" for a new, uncertain purpose. All structural beats serve this final, resonant shift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot demonstrates flawless causal logic under a Causal drive lens. Each step of the "successive approximation" builds logically upon the last, leading to a Decisive Change (the crozier's revival) with a clear, felt cost (the transformation of the alchemist's destiny). The structure is tight, well-paced by the "penny drops" device, and the final image lands with undeniable force, reconfiguring the protagonist's future.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a resonant atmosphere that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing (the shard is a key, not a relic). The closure lands cleanly, reconfiguring the city's state. However, the causality feels soft and the cost is negligible; Selin's success is never in serious doubt, which lowers the impact of the final change. The structure is sound for the length, but lacks a feeling of hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure under a Hybrid lens that becomes Causal at the climax. The closure, a Decisive Change, is unambiguous and occurs on the page. However, the plot progression is entirely frictionless; Lio’s first and only attempt succeeds perfectly, which lessens the narrative tension and the satisfaction of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building layers of effect toward a legible Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the bridge and the architect's subsequent realization re-weights the entire narrative with a clear conceptual cost (the ephemeral gallery is gone) and gain (a new understanding). The structure is elegant, and the closure lands with significant resonance for its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a simple, elegant sequence—contemplation, test, and resonant conclusion—that fits the length. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the anchor link symbol, lands cleanly. The "cost" is a subtle but legible shift from known isolation to an uncertain, alien-influenced future, captured in the phrase "somber marvel."

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure appropriate for its length and textural aims. The inciting incident is clear, the investigation progresses logically, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's role is crystallized. The cost—the "weight" of this ongoing duty—is felt, providing a satisfying, albeit quiet, conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot demonstrates a flawless causal structure under the Causal lens, moving from entry to objective to return with logical precision. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of her internal state and a Decisive Change in her mission status, is achieved on-page with a clear, felt cost in the burying of the codex. Orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each action logically enabling the next. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, earned on the page with a clear shift in the protagonist's understanding and a legible felt cost. The structure is perfectly scaled to the story's length, delivering a resonant final image without any wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative progresses through a series of intensifying sensory details. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the storyteller succeeds, but the cost is that the new language is "locked forever...a secret for no living tongue," a poignant and earned reconfiguration of his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through layered imagery and atmosphere rather than linear causality. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands decisively on the page: the arrowhead shatters, the moss silvers, and the beast’s laughter transforms. The cost is the destruction of the arrowhead, making the before/after state perfectly legible and earned within the story's unique logic.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building a cascade of resonant images toward a clear climax. The structure is sound for this length, with a single continuous scene and a valid Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The cost—the expenditure of the locust shell and the violinist's departure from the sanctuary he created—is legible in the final paragraph, providing a satisfying sense of a completed cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic weight toward a single, decisive action. The structure is clean and effective for its length, moving from entry to climax to resolution without deviation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration—the two drones crossing paths creates a "silent vow" that redefines the fragile peace—and the conceptual cost of using the storm is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the structure is coherent within that mode, deepening from a single object to the entire train. The final Conceptual Repricing lands with thematic clarity. However, the causality feels convenient; the song magically reveals a map, which reveals a staircase, in a sequence of unopposed discoveries that lack the friction of an earned progression, even for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate, the single scene builds intensity toward a clear climax, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration into Earned Stasis—is legible and landed on the page. The cost is the temporary nature of the event and Mara's ongoing solitary duty, which gives the ending its resonance. The narrative logic holds perfectly under its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean two-shard design under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with a legible transition between Mara and Lio. The story achieves a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure, redefining the "cipher of longing" as a bridge rather than a puzzle. The cost is felt in the dream's transformation from a tangible goal into a shared, intangible light, which is a sophisticated and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is sound. The plot progresses through a series of resonant images that build pressure toward the climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands effectively; the locksmith's purpose is clarified, and he accepts a new responsibility, which serves as a felt cost. The causal links are poetic but consistent within the story's magical logic, such as the wind revealing the groove.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot progresses as the protagonist gathers sensory and symbolic information, leading to a clear on-page closure: the water recedes and saplings appear. This Decisive Change is earned through the protagonist's final action, and the cost is the transformation of a private, mythic space into a public, reclaimed one. The internal logic, while magical, holds perfectly from setup to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a specific magical causality (tea leaves -> lullaby -> date -> sun/shadow alignment) that pays off decisively. The closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change (the glass shatters, the library is healed), with a clear cost (the unique shadow-glass object is destroyed). The structure is tight and purposeful for its length, holding its unique logic from setup to resolution without any breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds lyrically from the initial magical event to the final test. The arrival of the traveler provides a clear, on-page event that forces a choice, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the pruner’s mission is reaffirmed and expanded. The cost—the ongoing duty and the act of sharing a sacred piece of his work—is felt, making the closure earned and effective for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the plot unfolds as a single, continuous ritual that builds atmospheric pressure. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands with a palpable sense of peace, and the cost is subtly rendered in the dimming of the starlight, making the final state feel earned and resonant. The narrative logic is impeccable for its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is highly effective. It builds atmospheric pressure by layering images—the rain, the henge, the two videos, the map—toward a potent Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where the "tear was not a flaw but a portal," lands with a clear reweighting of meaning, and the final image of recording for the future provides a resonant cadence. The story successfully teaches and executes its non-causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure adheres perfectly to an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through imagery and reflection. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is executed with a clear final image (the shattering globe) and a legible, if abstract, cost (acceptance of dissolution). All orientation and scope requirements for this length are met without issue, resulting in a structurally sound and coherent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly structured under an Accumulative/Textural lens, using the three lightning flashes as precise beats to advance the connection between the balladeer and the ghost. The closure, an Earned Stasis where the ghost becomes a "permanent mural" and the courtyard a "living archive," is a resonant reconfiguration with a clear, felt cost—the shift from dynamic interaction to a beautiful but static state. Causality is seamless within its lyrical framework.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's structure is a model of efficiency. A clean causal chain (goggles lead to diary, which leads to chamber) serves an accumulative goal, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The inferred Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens holds perfectly, with the cost of confronting the spire's sorrow being legible, if slightly soft, in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural lens perfectly. The structure builds emotional density through a series of resonant images, leading to a quiet but definitive closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) that feels earned and satisfying within the story's brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a potent Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with the felt cost of the library's destruction, while the art's survival reconfigures the meaning of Lira's "limits." The causal logic of the coin dictating pigment drying times is a slight stretch, but it functions well as a symbolic constraint within the story's lyrical mode and does not harm the closure's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building details (phrasebook, board, light) toward a single intensification. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the ship's state is altered. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the risk of "draining the ship's own life-force" is mentioned but not dramatized, making the final success feel less hard-won than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through imagery and atmosphere toward a clear closure. The Decisive Change—fixing the clock—lands on the page and reconfigures the setting with the sunrise, while the cost is felt in the protagonist’s lingering nostalgia. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for its length, with every beat contributing to the final resonant image of the keeper of quiet hopes.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear accumulative/textural structure, and the closure unit lands as a resonant image of community. However, it fails the cost-proof test entirely; the central action is achieved without any friction, struggle, or trade-off paid on the page. This lack of a felt cost makes the resolution feel sentimental and dramatically inert, undermining the plot's publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, a borrowed pause for the world, lands with a legible, felt cost for Elara (“having saved a moment that could never be reclaimed”). The plot is simple but structurally sound and appropriate for the story’s length and lyrical aims.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is flawless. The story builds pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail, leading to a single, climactic act. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration: the curse remains, but the immediate situation is transformed for the travelers at the clear, felt cost of the caretaker's perpetual, thankless cycle. Every element serves this final, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through layered images toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands effectively, re-casting the empty chrysalis as a symbol of opportunity. The primary weakness is structural; the narrative compresses a long timeline ("Months later") into a short space, reading more like an elegant summary than a dramatized, high-pressure scene, which diffuses the story's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is excellent. The story builds pressure by accumulating poetic details that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing, where the vendor's understanding of "origin" is transformed. The closure lands cleanly with a legible, albeit subtle, cost—the dissolution of his driving quest. The arrival of the child feels like a slight coda that diffuses the main closure's power, but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully, building atmospheric pressure through sensory details until the final act. The closure is a decisive, on-page change—the shattering of the pavilion—which lands with a clear conceptual cost: the fortress is healed but left in a state of "brittle resilience." The plot is simple but structurally sound for its length, with every element serving the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sequence of resonant images toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration of the city. While the structure is coherent under this lens, the closure feels unearned due to a near-total absence of felt cost. The transformation is frictionless and immediate, undermining the gravity of healing the "city's scars" and weakening the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is masterful for its length. The plot builds through a single, coherent process to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, where the mirror's function and the protagonist's purpose are both transformed. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the fragility of the connection and the emotional weight of the dreams—making the final image resonate powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a tight, logical causal chain under the Causal lens. The inciting incident (doodle) leads directly to the climax (cipher) and resolution (seedlings). The closure provides a Decisive Change in Liora's purpose and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the library, with the felt cost of a new, unending duty, making the ending both satisfying and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density toward a clear closure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the silent grove becomes imbued with unheard music, lands effectively. The orientation is solid and the single-scene structure is well-handled. However, the final beat with the dancing hedgehog and emerging owls feels overly sentimental, slightly softening the cost and turning a powerful metaphor into a more simplistic fairy-tale resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a strong example of an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure effectively. Orientation is excellent, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tutor finds a new path forward—is earned and lands with a clear, felt cost. The story's progression is a coherent intensification of the character's internal state, culminating in a potent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building atmospheric density toward a clear closure moment. The plot mechanics, while magical, are internally consistent. The ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing (CR) as the personal quest for empathy is transformed into a public, teachable art, which constitutes a clear "before/after" with the implied cost of new responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through methodical observation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, occurs on the page, but its trigger is a significant causal break. The resolution hinges on Mara whispering to the wind, a magical act that feels unearned by the preceding scientific investigation. This deus ex machina-like moment at the climax undermines the story's established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira accepts her new role. However, the plot progresses through a series of discoveries that lack causal friction; it's an associative chain rather than a sequence of rising pressure. The "and-then" structure feels more like a tour of a beautiful concept than a story with narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and process that culminates in a well-defined closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where quantified sorrow becomes measurable peace, is earned through the on-page process of deconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood until a symbolic breakthrough. The structure is coherent and the Resonant Reconfiguration at closure is clear. However, the causal link at the climax—a mirror reflecting light from a never-before-seen portrait to open a lock—feels like a convenient magical solution rather than an earned consequence of prior choices, slightly weakening the plot's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The plot follows a clear Causal lens, with each discovery logically enabling the next, culminating in a Decisive Change. The structure is sound and the closure is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully landing a Conceptual Repricing at closure where the box of fear becomes a seed of calm. However, the causal linkage is weak; the decision to "miniaturize the chaos" to resolve "inner static" is a non-sequitur asserted by the narrator. Furthermore, the final resolution lacks a clearly dramatized cost, feeling more like a seamless upgrade than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmosphere toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The final scene with the boy provides a quiet but definite closure, solidifying Mara's new role.

The structure is the story's strongest architectural element.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building a series of resonant images that lead to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at closure. The initial state of loss (beached whale, withdrawn sea) establishes a clear cost, and the final image redefines the nature of memory itself. The internal magical logic is consistent and holds from the coffee grounds to the lantern's final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and effective under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is established immediately, and the ritual's progression builds logically toward a clear closure moment. The ending achieves an Earned Stasis on the page, though the "cost" of this stasis is felt more as a new, endless responsibility than a tangible price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building atmosphere and thematic weight toward its conclusion. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the narrator’s goal is re-contextualized with a clear felt cost—exchanging expediency for intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The structure is coherent, and orientation is clear. However, the closure, while legible, feels unearned; the climactic shift from listening to a sudden, transformative epiphany lacks a compelling trigger beyond the symbolic arrival of dawn. The conceptual cost is stated ("sorrow into strength") but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively until the ending, where a critical causality break occurs. The text states, "The key with no apparent lock melted into the stone," signifying its purpose is fulfilled. A few lines later, it says, "She tucked the key with no apparent lock into the folds of her robe." This direct contradiction fatally undermines the symbolic and literal integrity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive exceptionally well. The structure follows a clear progression of discovery, leading to a potent Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where joining the shells brings cosmic understanding, lands with a legible felt cost: her melancholy is transformed into a peaceful, purpose-driven responsibility. The causality is textural and entirely coherent within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building a series of resonant images that cohere into a final plan. The structure is sound for its length and mode, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's path forward is crystallized. However, the plot's progression relies on a series of convenient realizations rather than overcoming tangible opposition, which slightly softens the narrative force of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a resonant mood that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing. However, the structure is weakened by repetition; the second evening largely restates the epiphany of the first, rather than deepening it or introducing new pressure. This loop-like structure flattens the narrative progression, making the second half feel redundant instead of intensifying the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong, clear causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from suspicion to investigation to discovery. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, as the 'stillpoint' is redefined from a place to a mental state. This repricing lands on the page with a clear conceptual cost—Mira’s new responsibility—making the structure highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of a standard causal chain, it builds pressure through layered imagery and atmospheric density, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the new dawn forged from reclaimed shadows provides a legible "after" state, with the cost being the overthrow of the old solar order. Orientation is immediate and the lens holds perfectly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the loft becomes a "chapel of resonance." However, the closure's key final beat—the arrival of the child—is a convenient coincidence that resolves the poet's problem of transmission, rather than a complication he must overcome. This deus ex machina weakens the otherwise legible causal structure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with a clear because/therefore progression from setup to resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s purpose is sealed, is achieved on the page. However, the felt cost is minimal; a single tear does not feel proportionate to the declared stakes of achieving “the world’s last chance at redemption,” which slightly undermines the ending’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building atmospheric pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost as Elara's "impatient fire" cools, externalized by the ice's crack of "release." The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's internal, meditative focus, satisfying the 9+ test with a persistent constraint (the viaduct's rhythm) shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and atmospheric detail toward a resolution. The structure is simple but effective for this length. The closure, a Decisive Change (turning the valve), lands on-page with a felt cost—Mara's acceptance of her role in a historical struggle. The causal link between the lantern's flicker and the humidity surge is a convenient but functional device that connects the story's symbolic and practical threads.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the climax hinges on a coincidence that undermines the earned resolution. The sunlight striking the heart at the perfect moment, while foreshadowed metaphorically ("By the way light breaks through storm clouds"), functions as a *deus ex machina*, resolving the mechanical conflict with external grace rather than the characters' direct, sufficient action. This weakens the story's core causality at its most pivotal point.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where ringing the bell re-prices the goal as a "prank on fate" and immediately sets up the next quest, lands perfectly with a felt conceptual cost: satisfaction is not an end state but a catalyst for more yearning. The structure is elegant and serves the central concept without a single wasted move.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal lens, with each discovery logically compelling the next action in a tight, propulsive sequence. The final Conceptual Repricing—where absence becomes presence—is a powerful and earned closure that lands with the conceptual cost of a new, permanent responsibility for the archivist. The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the story's length, meeting the 9+ standard with a clear cost and persistent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a ritualistic sequence that is structurally coherent. Orientation is clear, and the closure—a Decisive Change where the crystal is reconstituted and the environment responds—lands cleanly on the page. The felt cost, the "weight of the moment" lifting, is legible, fulfilling the requirements for a strong, if poetically-rendered, causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is highly effective. It builds pressure through a cohesive sequence of images and sensations, leading to an on-page Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where the protagonist redefines solace, lands with the felt cost of abandoning her initial goal for a new, difficult purpose. The narrative logic is sound for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a clean, continuous scene with clear orientation, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the sentinel's role—lands with the felt cost of dissolving the past. The plot's progression, however, is slightly weakened by conceptual repetition rather than a steady deepening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully. The structure is a simple, elegant container for the central event, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end where the Keeper accepts his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and sensory detail toward a central epiphany. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's perspective is fundamentally altered, lands with a clear, albeit internal, cost. The structure is weakened slightly by having two endings: the powerful moment of realization, followed by a less impactful coda where she returns to leave a page, which dilutes the initial climax.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and deepening interior states rather than causal turns. The structure is a simple, effective journey to a central point.

This is a very strong structural performance for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual rather than causal plot turns. The structure is clean: setup (garden, body), development (the repair), and closure (internal shift, new map). The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively, transforming the "cleft" from a doubt into a gateway, with the cost being the emotional labor of confronting that uncertainty. The initial setup feels slightly arbitrary but serves the allegorical purpose well.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building density toward a clear closure moment. The structure is a single, coherent scene with good orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building toward a conceptual repricing at the end. However, the central causal link—using a sundial's shadows in dim light to align rusted gears—is physically nonsensical and breaks credibility. While symbolic logic is allowed, the text presents this as a mechanical solution, creating a significant flaw that undermines the otherwise clear structure and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the structure builds pressure through a sustained process rather than causal turns.

The final image of the new light provides a legible "after" state, while the Conceptual Repricing of "infinity" as a bridge for love is potent. The cost—the sorrow of remembered wars—is felt on the page, satisfying the rubric's requirements for a high-impact ending.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building density toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is coherent and the final image lands with resonance. However, the progression relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized scene, and the closure lacks a clearly legible cost, which softens the impact of Eliam’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a clear climax. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration where the restored balance is made tangible ("pendulum’s steady beat echoed... syncing with the pulse of the sea"). The felt cost—that "the work would never end"—is legible on the page and provides a satisfying, non-final resolution appropriate for the story's cyclical theme.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive effectively, building pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page with a felt conceptual cost ("pressure of centuries"). The structure is sound for its length, but the causal leap from decoding one soldier's story to discovering the universal "shape of intentions was a circle" feels more asserted than earned, slightly weakening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The plot follows a clean and logical causal chain, which is a strength. The closure, a combination of Decisive Change (kingdom saved) and Conceptual Repricing (the meaning of ignorance), is present on the page. However, the associated cost is merely told ("humbled") rather than shown or felt, which softens the impact of the ending and prevents it from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a private act to a public revelation. However, the closure, while resolving the "story famine," lacks a meaningful, on-page cost. The ending is a clean victory without a visible trade-off or lingering price, which significantly softens the impact of the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure adheres flawlessly to an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building intensity through a ritualistic sequence. Orientation is established effectively for a surreal piece. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the emotion is crystallized, lands on the page with a clearly articulated conceptual and emotional cost ("bittersweet reminder of loss and love intertwined"), making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist shifts from choosing one truth to synthesizing many, lands with clear conceptual cost—the abandonment of a simpler, combative worldview. The discovery of the cog syncing with the layers serves as a well-integrated trigger for this change, making the final stance feel earned within the story's reflective logic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is a clean, single scene that builds atmosphere, introduces pressure (the townspeople's hatred), offers a catalytic event (the music), and lands on a resonant closure. The ending is a Conceptual Repricing, establishing a "new beginning" with the felt cost of a continuous, quiet crusade. The plot is simple but structurally sound for its aims.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift and clear, and the narrative builds through a sequence of ritualistic actions toward a distinct climax. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the greenhouse from a "scar" to a glowing "beacon" of hope. The before/after state is legible, and the conceptual cost—pruning the past—is established, making the final image feel earned within its symbolic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a clear A-to-B-to-C causal chain (box to key to drone), which is structurally sound. However, the final closure—a Conceptual Repricing where "Echo" is revealed as the city's voice carried by lightning—feels like a convenient poetic leap rather than an earned resolution based on established world rules. This deus ex machina quality of the final answer slightly undermines the causality that preceded it, making the cost feel intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is coherent and the closure lands on the page. However, the cost is a significant weakness; the "weight of silence" is mentioned but never dramatized as a burden, making the sanctification feel frictionless and weakening the impact of the final before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural drive lens is held consistently. The structure successfully builds a series of deepening effects—from kelp to stone to memory—that culminates in a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration. The conceptual cost, the loss of simple certainty for complex possibility, is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an excellent Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where the flaw is reframed as a stabilizing principle, lands with a clear conceptual cost—the abandonment of the original goal. The chipped die acts as a persistent constraint that perfectly shapes the narrative's progression and final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic weight toward a quiet but decisive closure. The ending, where Jiro's memory validates Mara's efforts, functions as a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The cost—Mara's lonely, tireless work against the city's anonymous sigh—is felt throughout, making the final validation earned. The structure is simple but elegant for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive exceptionally well, building pressure through atmosphere rather than causal plot points. The structure is clean, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's emotional state shifts—lands with a clearly articulated cost: "a bittersweet acceptance of their shared history." The symbolic causality (bread thawing the amphitheater) is consistent with the story's magical realist logic and holds together beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal sequence (finds yoyo, deciphers pattern, activates engine), and the closure is a Decisive Change. However, the closure unit is severely weakened by a lack of tangible cost and a final paragraph that summarizes the theme instead of letting the final image resonate. The phrase "He had learned that to initiate change, one must first deconstruct the past" is an explanatory summary that undermines the on-page dramatization, making the ending feel told rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through a sequence of symbolic actions rather than strict causality. It lands a strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure with its Charged Poise ending—the final bargain presents a clear, reconfigured choice with a palpable, felt cost. The before/after state is legible, moving from a quest for knowledge to a choice about wielding power.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive lens, effectively building pressure through intensification rather than causal turns. The structure is clean: a process is introduced, deepened in response to environmental cues, and brought to a finale. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the final image of the humming orchard and the prophet's ongoing mission making the cost—a perpetual, restless duty—legible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building a mystery through layered patterns that culminates in a satisfying Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands cleanly, with the cost legible as a newfound, eternal responsibility. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, with each discovery logically leading to the next.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic density toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The structure is simple and effective for the length, with a clear before/after state of understanding. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the dissolution of a protective myth—but the physical manifestation of this (ivy retreating from light) feels overly literal and magical, slightly weakening an otherwise solid and well-anchored structure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural structure, building emotional and atmospheric density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, a reaffirmation of purpose, lands with a clear felt cost of ongoing commitment. However, a minor but noticeable continuity flaw occurs when Mara turns toward a "rising drawbridge" at the end, which should logically be lowering for her to exit, slightly muddling the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot progresses through a series of convenient discoveries rather than earned causality. After a strong opening scene, the narrative telescopes into a summary: the council immediately agrees to help, the stamp immediately reveals a cipher, the vault is immediately found. This "and then" structure undercuts the tension and makes the final revelation feel unearned and rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building emotional and atmospheric density toward a powerful climax. The closure is an excellent example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the final image of the cranes reweights the protagonist's grief into cyclical, paradoxical hope. The magical causality is internally consistent, and the cost of the ritual—the torment of memory—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is successful. The story builds a coherent atmosphere of technological mourning that escalates to a single, decisive moment of internal transformation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's consciousness shifts, lands clearly on the page, with the fractured geode and silenced alarms serving as a legible, if symbolic, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, but its closure—a Conceptual Repricing—critically fails the cost test. The resolution of finding "belonging" is achieved without any sacrifice, struggle, or trade-off, rendering the central achievement weightless. While the single-scene structure is sound, the causality is metaphorical ("as if...tugging at unseen threads") rather than mechanical, and the frictionless success undermines the narrative's foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and recurring imagery rather than strict causality. The two-shard structure (terrace-shore-terrace) is effective, and the ending provides a clear Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's understanding of his guilt is reweighted. The cost is legible as a confrontation with his "genealogy of guilt," giving the closure the necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure in a single scene, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, a significant logical flaw damages causality: the plan to "synchronize through moon phases" is contradicted when the moon implausibly shifts from a "waning crescent" to rising "full" by the next dawn. This error in the established world rule undermines the credibility of the resolution's mechanism, even if the emotional arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building emotional density toward a clear closure. Orientation is established immediately, and the single, continuous scene is well-handled. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the navigator reframes his past, lands with a legible felt cost—the acceptance of lingering sorrow. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for its purpose, making the internal before/after state change undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic weight through a sequence of discoveries. The structure is sound, and orientation is established well. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the idea of a "clean slate" is re-evaluated as "rewritten," with the cost being the acceptance of sorrow. The on-page action of tossing the baseball provides a concrete anchor for this internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative progresses as a single, coherent ritual. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is achieved on-page with a clear physical and existential cost: "her skin blossomed with faint bark patterns, while his spectral form softened into flesh." This before/after state is legible and earned by the story's atmospheric build-up, fulfilling the lens requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure is executed masterfully, building symbolic weight toward a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands cleanly with a legible on-page cost—the release of her own grief—that feels earned and significant. The dream-like causality is consistent and holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building emotional and atmospheric pressure toward a single, decisive climax. The internal logic (joy enables the work) is established and upheld, and the closure is a clear Decisive Change with the felt cost of leaving humanity's final artifact behind. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, moving from a static state of melancholic work to a transformative release.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a coherent atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands, and the orientation is clear. However, the resolution relies heavily on the convenient arrival of the fisherman and his exposition, a coincidence that resolves the central question rather than merely complicating it, which weakens the causal integrity even within this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story suffers from a significant structural flaw. The narrative seemingly concludes, then adds two paragraphs that retroactively insert crucial plot mechanics, such as Kael fashioning mirrors. This breaks the initial causal chain (tracing with a quill) and makes the plot feel patched together and less elegant than its prose suggests. While the Accumulative/Textural lens holds and the closure lands, this retroactive exposition severely weakens the story's structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure toward a single causal climax. The closure, a Decisive Change in Selene's relationship with her curse, lands with the felt cost of new responsibility ("settle like a mantle"). The magical logic is internally consistent and the pacing is masterful for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a single, coherent ritualistic scene. The structure is sound, with orientation established early. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the poet re-frames trauma as a terrain—lands cleanly, with the cost being the emotional and spiritual weight of the vigil itself. The causality is atmospheric and psychological, fitting the story's aims perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure with a short coda, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing. However, the coda over-explains the duel's meaning, weakening the resonance of the final image by turning it into a summary. The final paragraph, beginning "The story of the duel spread...," shifts into pure exposition, which feels like a structural misstep that dilutes the preceding scene's power.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building towards a resonant final state rather than a causal climax. The structure is coherent, with the coffee tin serving as a clear inciting incident. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with felt cost, crystallizing the rebellion's achievement in the final image of the glowing library, a "garden in stone."

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of traditional causality, it builds pressure through the layering of surreal imagery (clock, arbor, compasses). The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where the pianist's performance transforms these elements into a new, stable order ("compasses into steady stars"), landing with a clear and legible felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building symbolic density toward a powerful close. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the seed awakens, but the impending monsoon reconfigures the stakes, leaving a tangible, felt cost in the final image. The story's internal, symbolic causality is perfectly suited to its lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building toward its conclusion through layered imagery and ritual rather than a causal chain. Orientation is established effectively, and the structure is coherent for its mode. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tutor understands apology as a feeling, lands with a felt cost—his own released regret and acceptance of an ongoing duty—making for a solid and earned final state.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned observations of dust and decay, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara's realization reweights her premise with undeniable humility as cost, evident in the final whisper to vines. Orientation anchors early in the greenhouse post-flood. One meaningful cadence shift over weeks deepens the stake without requiring causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned images like frost and ledger, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where purpose is repriced with conceptual cost in the final glass-singing image, making before/after legible. Orientation anchors who (Elya), where (canyon), and when (night after fire) by ~50 words, avoiding penalties. One meaningful cadence shift tightens resonance at the end, sufficient for length, though some ellipsis feels unmotivated without stronger linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of frost and vibration to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final chord, with conceptual cost legible in weaving storms into song; orientation anchors early in the conservatory. Closure lands on-page with Charged Poise as the conservatory exhales, reweighting silence. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, but minor elision in device activation slightly softens causality without breaking lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of light and rest toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the library's glow as a sanctuary, with conceptual cost in Marlow's merging silhouette; orientation anchors early with the submerged library and package, but causality feels elliptical with unmotivated transitions like the floating pedestal, slightly weakening linkage without breaking the textural cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned repetitions of dawn, night, and bell tones, creating a resonant reconfiguration in the enduring hope at the end with conceptual cost of forced solidarity. Orientation anchors early with Mara under the arbor, avoiding penalties. Closure lands as Charged Poise via the bell's lingering tone reweighting isolation as a binding force, though minimal causal linkage keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery of breath, light, and veins, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where love's release reweights compassion with conceptual cost in the dimmed tear; orientation anchors early with the viaduct and Milo. Closure lands on-page with felt healing, but causality feels elliptical in the tunnel's sudden appearance, relying on whisper without stricter linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through layered motifs like vines and photographs, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the maze reveals time's texture with conceptual cost in loss and renewal, as in the final glowing garden image. Orientation anchors early with the garden and Mara, but causality is elliptical without motivated ellipsis changing options distinctly. One meaningful cadence shift suffices, yet the ending feels more declarative than reweighted with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under a Causal lens, the plot advances through because/therefore linkages, like solving the puzzle unlocking the stair, leading to the vault and eventual planting, with orientation anchored early in the abandoned carnival. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara plants the seed and her chains rust loose, carrying a felt conceptual cost of past oppression. One meaningful tightening occurs at the puzzle, narrowing options effectively for this length, though some metaphorical elements slightly soften causal traceability without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns of absences, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where memory bridges trust's breaking and mending with a conceptual cost in the orchard's grief; orientation anchors early with the sunken greenhouse amid shipwrecks. Closure lands on-page with the device's humming chord reweighting prior material, but causality feels elliptical without motivated ellipsis narrowing options distinctly. The persistent constraint of the forge shapes tactics, yet redundant image loops slightly dilute the pattern break at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and motifs to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira redefines her calling, with felt cost in her promise and departure; orientation anchors early in the station under moonlight. One meaningful deepening occurs via the moonbeam map, sufficient for length, though causality is more poetic than strict linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned motifs like thawing ice and glass, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the ending where the room becomes a cradle, with conceptual cost of abandoning control legible in the final whisper. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (control room), and when (great melt) by the first sentence, avoiding penalties. Closure lands on-page with charged poise, reweighting the stake, though causality is more textural than linear.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned elisions and density increases, with orientation anchored early in the rusted library under stars. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise in the final emergence, reweighting her identity with the conceptual cost of confessed vulnerability made legible in the amber fire rippling through veins. One meaningful deepening suffices, but causality feels elliptical in the shell-to-vial progression, with the lever's release relying on symbolic rather than strict linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of hush and silence toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the map dissolves into air, reweighting the premise of charting the void with conceptual cost of endless looping; orientation anchors early in the ridge fort during the storm. Closure lands on-page with the final dissolution, but lacks a decisive physical act, relying on resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful cadence shift in the storm's intensification suffices for length, though causality feels elliptical without stronger before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density builds through resonant echoes and pattern shifts, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where thoughts are amalgamated with circuitry, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost in the final aurora display.

    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered imagery and pattern shifts toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the experiment reweights time's nature with conceptual cost in the unfurling flora; orientation anchors early in the research station, but causality feels elliptical with setups like the lever not tightly linked to prior beats, diluting the final reconfiguration's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and patterns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where playing the note reveals the code as silences, with a legible conceptual cost in the ghost's fading presence. Orientation anchors early in the flooded opera house with Mara in the pit, and causality holds via textural density increases, like water imprints merging into staff lines. The ending reweights the stake effectively, though a minor ambiguity in the ghost's legend setup slightly softens hindsight inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the truth's weight lifts, with felt cost in the auroral sorrow and swallowed lie. Orientation anchors who (Mirela), where (mountain station), and when (dawn after fever) by the first sentence, serving the introspective drive. One meaningful deepening occurs via the smudged illustration revealing data, reweighting knowledge without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned echoes of confessions and ghost shifts, but causality is loose with no clear tightening; closure as Earned Stasis occurs on-page when Mara leaves the wheel, reconfiguring the truth's weight with conceptual cost felt in his ribs, yet orientation anchors "who" and "where" early while "when" remains vague past 120 words without serving closure. No meaningful reversal narrows options, relying on textural density that doesn't fully reweight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through layered images and patterns toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where "silence births renewal" reweights his role with conceptual cost of erased centuries; orientation anchors early in the catacombs library. Causality holds via textural linkages, but some elisions like the origami's unfolding feel more poetic than motivated, slightly loosening midpoint pressure. The final image reconfigures meaning effectively, with one meaningful cadence shift sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned imagery of music and nature toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final cycle of curls and wonder, with a subtle conceptual cost in the ongoing responsibility. Orientation anchors who (Liora), where (Sage Ridge), and when (eclipse) by the first sentence, avoiding penalties. However, the mosaic of reflective shards lacks a meaningful tightening, relying on cadence shifts without narrowing options. The closure lands with resonance but feels more declarative than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned echoes like humming and vibrations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the axis realigns with the cost of humanity's last dream sigh, legible in the final image. Orientation anchors early with the silo and historian, avoiding disorientation penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern breaks like the tablet's pulsing building to dissolution, but causality is loose without motivated ellipsis changing options clearly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via the tablet dissolving and him falling upward, with conceptual cost of embracing fractures legible in the final image, though cost proof is oblique. Orientation anchors who (gravity defier) and where (viaduct) early, but "when" remains vague in fractured timelines without serving closure payoff. No major causality breaks, but redundant echoes dilute pressure toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and pattern shifts from backward to forward songs, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the filament glows and numbness dissolves with felt conceptual cost in revived emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    Closure is a quiet lyrical reweighting (tube dropped into shaft → “truth will travel”), but causality is implied not enacted; the reader can infer but never witnesses the decisive channel open, leaving the lane of agency slightly blurred.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Arlen’s stance crystallizes into a lifelong vocation, the cost foreshadowed by the vial’s dimming halo and the greenhouse’s sigh. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each scent-layer tightens the emotional density until the final reconfiguration. No orientation debt; anchors (vaulted greenhouse, twilight) appear within 120 words. One minor scaffold: “the transformation completes” is asserted rather than dramatized, but it does not break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the poet binds the rope, foreclosing the path of release, and the cost is legible in the line “sealing the echo of the escaped soul.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layer uncovered reweights the rope’s meaning—though the causal chain is lightly sketched rather than tightly linked.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is “transformed into a gentle hum” with visible communal effect. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added note thickens the air until the final chord reweights the orchard’s silence. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure unit lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the charged petal is sealed, the emotion is now market-ready—options re-sorted with the felt cost that Mara now embodies. Causal beat chain (static collection → petal infusion → vial seal) stays taut; no teleporting props or outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cumulative closure—Charged Poise from the returned locket reconfigures communal memory while preserving the open future. Causality arcs from misdelivery → shared ledger → library ceremony; every beat depends on the preceding. Orientation holds: library-skylight, pier, lighthouse are anchored by ~120 words. Closure does not reset stakes; they simply crystallize with felt communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glyph’s redefinition from hidden mark to living symbol reweights the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of shared reeds and light—held to the end. One transition (nightfall) is clean; orientation is anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira releases the pendant and the city’s cadence steadies. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple, glow, and echo layers density until the final image reweights time itself. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the pendant, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens; closure lands as Charged Poise when the orchard “shed luminous petals” reweighting grief into hope.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the blue glow crystallizes Maren’s new stance as visible guide, foreclosing her former invisibility. Causal chain holds—cache → spindle → circuit completion → glow—each beat narrowing options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“forgotten wing… oldest library”) and reinforced spatially. No teleporting props; the tape fragment’s journey from pipe chase to spindle is tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the leaf’s greening is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise; causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the middle beats feel slightly repetitive in their patient observation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange of paintings for the pulse reweights Mara’s world, cost visible in the mist-varnished cliffs.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (the cave inhabits Lira’s destiny), but the causal chain is diffuse: the pilgrim’s arrival triggers no irreversible choice; Lira merely witnesses. Orientation is clear early, yet the lens hovers between Situational and Accumulative without firm linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—communal chorus crystallizes—but cost is collective, not focal. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks, yet the tightening beat is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger reweights the premise from stone fortress to living archive, and the mapper’s new role as conduit carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower becomes a sanctuary, the tile settles into calm, and Lira’s stance crystallizes with the whispered promise—cost is the permanent openness she now must maintain. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of imagery and pattern intensify until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the immortal’s goodbye to emptiness is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights eternity itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each prismatic echo and magnetic tremor layers until the final crystallizing tunnel. The spatial mutiny is taught early and paid off in the folding corridors. No orientation debt; anchors are vivid by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closuregate: causal lens of ‘active stillness → breach → equitable contract’ lands on page with ink-glow and felt societal price. Orientation clear by paragraph 3; ellipsis between asylum packet and funeral grief is motivated by breach logic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the labyrinth inhaling the lamp’s hum crystallizes the invented histories as “bridges” with felt conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light and silence layers until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the “when the town finally whispers again” beat is off-stage and dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—fragments accrue until the tidal projection reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “I would remain the unnamed keeper” crystallizes the stance and its cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by the rusted-forklift box within 120 words. No causality breaks; the label’s numbers indexing timestamps is the decisive pattern break that tightens the weave.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each resonant hum layers density until the final chord reweights the stake—myths survive through retelling. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost (curiosity must stay mobile), but the ledger’s “final verses” arrive late and slightly dilute causality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: chip → graffiti map → layout shift → postponed privatization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the city’s “steadier rhythm” is won at the price of Mira’s perpetual vigilance, visible in the final image of her charting new routes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shutter’s click crystallizes the moment the grain’s story is archived, reconfiguring the inspector’s stance from witness to elegist.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s sacrifice of the beacon reweights the premise, and the temple’s amber hush crystallizes the cost. Causality is mostly Accumulative/Textural—patterned intensification of scent, memory, and tide—held without contradiction. A slight lens wobble occurs when the temple “demands” the price; the rule is asserted rather than taught early, but the final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy’s legend flips from false alarm to guiding light, with the lattice’s glow charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story aligns with the Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens via repetitive acts of awakening (resonant notes, leaf unfurls). Closure image—orchard's luminescent blossoms—delivers Charged Poise that reweights the premise: love itself becomes venomous fertilizer. Spatial/temporal anchors are poetic yet coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when final breath is released; causal chain between bead, breath, and bloom is legible though lightly ethereal.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s transformation from ruin to reverence is legible, and the old guildmasters’ kneeling signals irreversible change. Causality is lyrical (Accumulative/Textural lens) rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. The luminous map on the plate provides the final charged image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unearthed layer deepens the orchard’s resonance until the sundial’s click reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the orchard’s hush after the chime—felt cost is the irreversible shift from silence to answered prayer.

    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral’s droplet seals the new meaning, reweighting the child’s trauma. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each deciphered phrase layers density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    Plot threads daydream-time with mural-growth montage; closure is a soft Reverberation rather than decisive change (fragment melding with night sky). Accumulative lyricism obeys its own internal rhythm, yet no concrete choice is foreclosed with palpable cost; it drifts toward closure rather than tightens toward it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflected sound layer deepens stakes until the garden’s heartbeat mirrors hers, achieving Charged Poise with clear before/after reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a lyric CR: the nebulae burst reweights the shell into “a library of light.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and cadence shift lands. Yet the cost is diffuse—centuries of longing are summarized, not dramatized—so the felt price is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: caretaker refills candle and whispers anew, an Earned Stasis that forecloses closure and cycles loss forever. Causal lattice is delicate—because wind passes, therefore name-resonance is caught and stored—but the logic is legible under Accumulative lens. No gaps, prop amnesia, or retroactive patch. Time and place anchor early and stay stable across repetitive ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Selene’s decision to invert storyteller/subject roles is legible and carries conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery of reversal and half-light tightens until the final darkness—but the causality between campfire stick glow and epiphany is more associative than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (knot-seal with moth wing) satisfies Resonant Reconfiguration: history acknowledged, path renounced. Drive lens clearly Accumulative/Textural: patterning of light, wings, knots intensifies mood rather than causality. Causality remains poetic—glow pulses “in sync” but not because/therefore logic. Still, final image reweights premise with visible cost (her heart stays “transiently rooted”).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early; pattern, cadence, and density layer meaning toward the fable of absence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (tower stilled, fable made legible) with felt, if understated, cost. One moment of causality wavers: seal is introduced, rope already stored; no prior tether in scene logic, a mild motivation gap.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: echoes layer, cracks sing, ice melts into literal silence—final image of “hammered repose” provides Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (caves quiet, beings fade, mapkeeper assumes eternal vigil). Orientation anchor appears in sentence two, causality holds.

    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cog’s ticking reweights the premise, fusing rival histories into a shared pulse. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sedimentary clues and brass rhythm tightening to final cadence. One transition (surface silence → sewer study) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the library becomes a crucible, the rosette glows, and the town’s hatred is audibly rusting away—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each chord thickens the pattern until silence itself is re-weighted. One minor drift: the “weeks that followed” epilogue dilutes the single-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse pulses amber, the city’s lullabies now live in neural foliage, and Mara’s “gentle rebellion” forecloses the old world’s silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sensory layer tightens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tower’s revival and the drone’s return reconfigure the city’s soundscape and Mara’s understanding of “failure.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned images (bells, amber veins, echo) tighten until the final pulse. Cost is felt in the confession of lost wonder, though the price is conceptual rather than personal. Orientation is secure within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure unit is a Charged Poise: “hush that would keep beating beneath the surface” crystallizes options and charges earlier motifs; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build across hush beats, cost felt through shared surrender of city-noise.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s tapestry is “speckled with nuanced colors,” but the cost is diffuse—felt more as mood than as a foreclosed path. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the memory-threading tightens pattern rather than forcing a decisive change. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the staircase’s quiet anthem reweights the premise—perpetual motion achieved not by escape but by integration of flaw. Causality holds: each roll feeds the tilt algorithm, the chipped die’s eventual face-up lands as earned scar. One transition (base → eighth → twentieth landing) is cleanly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of pigment and moonlight thickens the pattern until the courier’s memory reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the greenhouse becomes a “saffron-lit bridge”—with felt cost in Mara’s sleepless vigil, though the beat is slightly diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amphitheater doors open and displaced artisans reclaim their crafts, cost felt in the lingering “honeyed dread.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the lens holds and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the beacon ignites, reconfiguring fate for islanders and self. Causal chain (yoyo → gears → light) holds; only minor drift is the off-stage sailor beat that dilutes single-scene focus.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of luminance, cursed rose, and paradoxical notes tightens toward a Charged Poise at the end. Closure is legible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard breathes as one instrument, a charged poise that reweights the premise. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift rather than causal chain—and the lens holds. Cost is conceptual (the prophet’s solitary onward drift) but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes into “vowed to keep listening,” reweighting the premise with felt cost. Causal chain holds—each whistle blast tightens the linkage between shell pattern, watcher response, and her new cartographic vow. One transition (tunnel emergence) is clean. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end. Minor slack: the watchers’ light-language arrives as gift rather than earned negotiation, softening the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the letter freezes in sunlight, ivy loosens, and the station’s decay is conceptually repriced. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: Mara’s promise to return seals the pavilion’s memory and forecloses immediate rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each note layers density until the final amber glow reweights the whole. Cost is visible in the “quiet fire” of ink bleeding onto vellum. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamped glyph reconfigures the city’s future and Mara’s purpose. Causal chain holds—cross-referencing charts leads to staged-flood hypothesis leads to vault discovery—though the vault reveal is slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative lens chosen: pressure rises via density and recurring “record-polish-fold” cycle. Closure as Charged Poise—basilica ascends/descends—reconfigures meaning with felt cost (“heart sinks into aching past”). Anchor clear by word 90. Causality intact: one tightening culminates in the final lift. No lens ambiguity detected.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens controlled from bruised-violet sky to crystallized finale; each beat lifts density and cadence, final Charged Poise (geode shards floating, bleak exhilaration) lands with felt conceptual cost. No causality gaps, orientation clear at 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s hover and the chip’s hum crystallize the new “frequency of belonging” with felt communal cost. Causal chain—star-trail map → drone path → lever → harmonic tone—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by dusk light and drone rotors within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the withheld truth is weighed and the ledger of lies re-priced. Causal chain holds—summons → shore → carving alignment → watch-hand key—yet the stranger’s motivation remains off-stage, a mild ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene, single POV; moon-phase synchronisation and apology-forgiveness frame are anchored inside 100 words. Closure (Earned Stasis) is on-page: rope dropped, prisoners listed, shared turning point accepted—stakes shifted permanently. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of hush, pull, rope, moon tightens until the closing cadence crystallises a stance. Cost is visible in the rope’s literal fall and the negotiator’s untouched drawer-pull, “now warm from his palm.”

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sunrise dissolves sorrow and the compass steadies, reweighting regrets into “lessons rather than shackles.” Causal chain (abandonment → regret → compass wobble → pole-shadow course → sunrise acceptance) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the lingering memory of betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: tossing the baseball reweights the premise, and the lake’s brightening offers conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of glowing clues, charged objects, and final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirror forecloses denial of empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged form is on-page, the cost (loss of full humanity) is visible, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the bond. Orientation is swift; causality holds. Minor ellipsis in how the spices actually open the veil is acceptable under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reclaimed droplet reconfigures the twins’ future with felt cost (her own vanishing). Causal linkage is lyric rather than strict; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds, though orientation drifts early and is never fully anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locked dimension blossoms open, the ship drifts empty, and Nara’s weightlessness literalizes her renunciation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shimmer-stitch tightens the veil until the final crack. The cost is conceptual (she abandons the last human artifact) and felt in the image of “ghosts of those who had stitched peace.”

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: pattern of glowing sand, firefly release, and celestial echo reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the luminous tapestry reconfigures meaning with felt cost. However, the decisive change is attributed to cosmic alignment more than Mara’s agency, slightly blurring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cradle’s invisible currents reconfigure the garrison’s mindset, cost felt in their quiet disobedience. Causal chain (sundial clues → bronze quill → cradle activation) is coherent; blackout timeframe anchors early. Minor drift: “unexplained blackout” never narrows tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the Fibonacci sequence of painted rocks gathers density until the violet flame reconfigures both tide and curse. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Selene’s stance crystallizes as she accepts perpetual, iterative labor. Cost is visible: the curse becomes lifelong compass, the flame departs downstream, and she steps forward knowing future loops remain. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s ring crystallizes the poet’s stance that scars are terrain, not wounds, with the cost of forever carrying that map. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each 23-minute tick layers density until the storm-softened drizzle reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—question becomes destination—yet the causal chain from sundial angles to needle-card revelation is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear; single scene holds; lens reads Accumulative/Textural with one deepening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—“We have rebuilt a garden in stone”—with conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each night’s rebuilding tightens the pattern. The Orientation Test is met by ~90 words. Minor drift: the “year” jump is asserted, not bridged.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the encore rewrites fate and the clock stops, sealing time. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is taught early through the deserted platform and broken clock; no drift. One minor causality wobble: the “concealed frame” mechanic appears late without prior seeding.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each symbolic translation thickens atmosphere until the seed’s sprout reweights the ridge’s memory. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the monsoon will test the living archive—but the causality between dream-translation and sprout could be one notch sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Employs an Accumulative/Textural drive: the repeated knot-weaving ritual and compass response build symbolic density until the sky re-colors itself. The on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (sky turning “deep cerulean” that mirrors but also forgives the tutor’s regret) carries a clear conceptual price—memory loosens, the compass settles, the island exhales. Causality is soft but the pattern is coherent; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "decay never truly ends, it only cycles" crystallizes the Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by word 40; cost legible in the greenhouse's "scarred yet hopeful" transformation foreclosing grandiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: melted frost reveals path, but the fire's ashes remain a "scorched testament." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned frost/ledger recurrence, though coincidence in ledger discovery slightly softens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as the conservatory "exhales" with silence turned to song; cost legible in "each vibration smoothing jagged memory" under Accumulative/Textural lens held since midpoint ("willingness to hear quiet places").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (Marlow's dissolution into the light), crystallizing rest as permanent address. Accumulative lens holds, though reflection block slightly dilutes present-frame pressure near midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation Test failure: "who/where/when" unclear past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff. Accumulative lens holds with Earned Stasis closure (bell's echo as enduring promise), but mid-story deepening lacks pressure escalation—success feels unearned without visible cost spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (vanished photographs leaving only scent), and accumulative lens holds through density escalation. However, escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options—photograph dissolution is intentional, not a cost-driven tightening. Orientation clear by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "chains now rusted loose" crystallizes freedom’s cost as the wall falls. Causal lens holds perfectly—key decoding directly unlocks stairs—yet the humming arrow mechanism edges toward convenience without sufficient prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands via the humming device reconfiguring trust as malleable, but cost remains conceptual ("weight of memories") without visceral on-page sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds consistently through density of color-sound motifs, yet fails cost proof test—no specific image anchors the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: lantern ignition symbolizes surrender of thievery for guardianship. But cost remains abstract—no visible sacrifice like destroyed tools or exposure. Orientation clear by line 1; Accumulative lens holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "abandon the illusion of control" crystallizes stakes with visible cost (bookmark as compass). Orientation anchors by line 5, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening until final paragraph where Mara’s realization reconfigures options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis via lever step with conceptual cost ("vulnerability is power"), but constellations rearranging into her name backwards strains the causal lens as unearned coincidence rather than motivated escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands but cost remains abstract; "map dissolving into air" lacks tangible consequence. Two distinct non-closure issues (cost ambiguity + lens consistency at climax) trigger -1.5 cap from 8.6 baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "each droplet fell like a tiny comet" crystallizes the ephemeral nature of thought-origins. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup in the resonance experiment, with twilight deepening as organic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (mistrust thawing), but causal linkage to doodles-to-mic sequence is vague; "residual light" physics amnesia slightly undermines Accumulative lens coherence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "garden now recognized its keeper" crystallizes stance with felt cost in "weight of both bloom and rot." Orientation anchors by 100 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases via marble polishings—but "luck gauge" lacks causal integration, slightly muddying escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in crew's altered perception ("icy warmth... chilling and comforting"). Orientation clear by line 1, but lens ambiguity early (causal vs. textural) slightly weakens escalation coherence despite strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: lanterns steadying after the chord reveals cost (ghost's dissolution as "presence fading like mist"), with the dry program proving conceptual reweighting. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—water patterns intensify density until the silence-revelation reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: console’s weight-matching number makes emotional shift legible. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (“humidity gradient,” trembling barometer”), but orientation anchors slightly past 120 words weaken causality tightness for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (truth's weight anchoring past), but the "pressure settle into ribs" image lacks visceral specificity to fully satisfy cost proof test. Accumulative lens holds through resonant reconfiguration of "weight" from physical to emotional tonnage.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure (Conceptual Repricing: "silence births renewal") lacks visible cost; "centuries of weight" erased feels unearned. Accumulative/Textural lens holds but final image’s fragility ("crumbling peace") isn’t charged by prior causality. Orientation clear by 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise where the saplings' shift toward light crystallizes hope's cost, but escalation relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven pressure narrowing options under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens holds with density escalation, but protagonist passivity weakens causal weight. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost, though agency feels incidental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (gull carrying message) achieves Charged Poise under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no on-page sacrifice or consequence for the writer’s actions weakens final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "stillness shattered" exposes "hidden assumptions" with felt cost (soul consumption risk). Accumulative lens holds through resonant spiral to indigo flare, reconfiguring the city's reality with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost reweighting longing as compass, but cost isn't legible on-page per "cost proof test"—"no longer burden" is stated not shown. Accumulative lens holds though pressure lacks meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: density builds through recurring light/rain motifs toward Charged Poise closure where tablet dissolution reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("every ending is merely a drop"). Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in "carry weight of all fractured selves" and rain imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: mirrored hush crystallizes options with visceral cost ("frost dissolving like droplets"). Orientation perfect by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through tactile escalation. Cost unmistakable in marrow-deep pulses against the filament.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with tube rising on the gust, but quarantine pressure remains situational rather than escalating causally. Cost felt but not concretely demonstrated on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: sealing the vial with copper embodies Earned Stasis ("profound peace" after tears), with conceptual cost ("grief transformed into a lantern") legible in the final image. Accumulative lens holds as scent layers reweight memory’s "living current" with escalating density.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing succeeds: binding the rope crystallizes "paradoxical gift" with conceptual cost ("sealing the echo"). Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (multiplying choices, spiraling tunnels), though orientation anchors slightly past 120 words weaken initial causality clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("chronic hush was not a void but a space waiting to be filled"). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Minor ambiguity in how bowl "sings a chord" slightly weakens cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of half truths settle like dust"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; orientation anchors within 40 words, though the final courier interaction slightly dilutes the grotto's crystallized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: locket's "quiet shine" reweights compassion's cost through the final image, but the symphony-to-library transition lacks causal linkage, creating minor orientation drift in the opening shard.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Charged Poise closure, but cost proof fails: "luminescent ache softening into steady glow" lacks legible price. No visible sacrifice or constraint at climax—glyph discovery requires no struggle, undermining escalation. Orientation succeeds early but closure cost remains conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Mira becoming the echo, but cost ("releasing pendant") feels conceptual rather than visceral—no tangible forfeiture beyond the object. Orientation anchors by line 3, yet cost proof test fails: "released the infinity pendant" lacks felt consequence, warranting the -0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation Test fails: unclear who/where past 120 words ("secretive conjurer" in "cavern orchard" lacks anchoring). Closure achieves Charged Poise (grief+hope=renewal) with conceptual cost, but causal pressure is thin. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes when commuters sense Maren’s presence; cost legible in "lifelong invisibility surrendered" via sapphire-hush glow. Hybrid lens (Accumulative building to Situational stance) holds, though pipe-chase discovery lacks causal urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds perfectly with sensory accumulation toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is palpable in "reluctant metamorphosis" as the leaf's slow surrender charges the verdant green payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: mist preserving colors charges the cost of surrendered paintings, but the "island exhaled" anthropomorphism slightly softens the felt cost in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—unpredictability as promise—but "feels like a promise" abstracts cost; misses Q2 9+ test’s concrete cost proof at "Lira knows the future will remain unseen".

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when the valve releases the chord, crystallizing communal meaning with conceptual cost of embracing absence. But exile backstory exceeds reflection ceiling without concrete anchoring (e.g., no micro-choice altering present tactics), triggering -0.4 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "conduit that could translate silent stories" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (burden of hidden narratives), though "trembling certainty steadied into awe" slightly softens the felt price; Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the tile’s "steady glow" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("turned skepticism into a bridge"), under Accumulative/Textural lens; density escalation via whale-song verses tightens pressure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: "whispered goodbye to former emptiness" with visible cost in amulet dissolving into dust. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—spatial mutiny's density shift (rooms→luminous tunnel) reweights "goodbye" as transition. Orientation crystal-clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures asylum as "living covenant" with conceptual cost (bureaucratic rigidity dissolving), but the cost remains abstract—no tangible personal sacrifice on-page weakens final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a resonant Charged Poise ("invented histories were not lies but bridges") with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of collected textures settle like pressed petals"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably from first line to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with conceptual cost: "a purpose that no death certificate could erase" crystallizes the void-to-archivist shift, charged by the tide’s rhythm and label’s glow at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "myths survive when retold through art" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (fixed truth sacrificed for fluid meaning). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in resonant hums, though escalation lacks one decisive intensification beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the phoenix mural crystallizes community resolve with undeniable conceptual cost ("the fight had only begun"). Accumulative pressure through graffiti patterns holds consistently, though council's sudden postponement edges toward convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "darkened stripe on the film" proves the universe received the offering, with cost legible in "tremor of grief" as the grain vanishes—Accumulative lens held via atmospheric pressure building to this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: Mara’s "magnetic calm" reconfigures the drone’s purpose with conceptual cost (the lag as an unavoidable data point). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; anchor clanging’s vibration echoing in her chest makes cost legible without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("ice sang, and the world listened") under Accumulative lens, but cost proof slightly oblique; condensation-to-transmitter sequence tightens meaning without causal loopholes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "balance settled like dust on a drum" making cost legible, but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through rhythmic density buildup to revival, though escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Mara’s beacon sacrifice creates undeniable conceptual cost (forfeiting safety for shared hope), validated by the temple’s fish spelling "unsnarl" and the scent’s release. Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through sensory density shifts, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (transforming legend into guidance), but the lattice's "hum" implies future protection without tangible sacrifice. Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) holds through final beacon image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (her fading into ash), and Accumulative lens holds through resonant awakenings tightening the debt-repayment stakes. Minor deduction: debt mechanics remain abstract despite visceral sensory escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: the woven labyrinth guides travelers with conceptual cost (empty tide pools, broken precedents). Accumulative lens holds—density of luminous threads reweights "ruin to reverence" with felt cost in the final image ("echo of her song lingered"). No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density (roots recoiling, bones rattling) toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "cautious calm" settling, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—completion feels inevitable rather than earned through narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("margins held luminous stories"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens weakens slightly as chalk-to-hologram progression feels predetermined rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: sending the chart forecloses her path with conceptual cost (ember fading to ash). Orientation debt avoided as disorientation serves closure ("echoed silence" motif crystallizes in final breath). Missing visceral cost in protagonist’s body weakens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: dissolution of letters into fireflies crystallizes stakes with felt cost (grief evaporated). Orientation anchors within 20 words, but "fierce tenderness" repetition slightly dulls escalation’s conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Charged Poise closure lands with coral vibration and droplet sealing, but cost ("graft won't heal instantly") remains conceptual without concrete on-page forfeiture; anesthetic dependency weakens causal escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: fog thinning into "soft sunrise" crystallizes options with undeniable cost in the fragment's dissolution ("essence mingling with starlight"), fulfilling all Accumulative/Textural lens requirements with zero causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("old certainty drift away"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase where each bell echo deepens vibration stakes without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (thoughts as untaxable), but orientation fails by 120 words: "where" remains vague (city/lab?) without payoff. Accumulative lens holds yet escalation lacks pressure—no narrowing of options, just atmospheric deepening. Cost feels asserted not anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks when nebulae bloom, scattering starlight as "pollen" that coaxes the sea to pause—a Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (centuries of longing transformed). No orientation debt; time dilation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: regret softens but returns, signaling loss as cyclical. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies through ritual repetition and the traveler’s arrival, reweighting stakes via the glass orchid’s tangible resonance without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the archive's breath and keepers' nod crystallize the "renewed covenant" with conceptual cost of broken trust mended; accumulative/textural lens holds through glyph progression tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as water flow becomes "conversation," reconfiguring the stake with undeniable cost in the elder's trembling doubts. Accumulative lens holds through binary pulse escalation narrowing options to harmonic balance. Cost proof lands in "doubts tremble into silence" amid ash alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with felt cost ("inevitable wilt of memory") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density builds through dust-pigeon-map integration, though the community humming resolution edges toward coincidence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (threshold-as-memory with corn husk scent), but orientation falters: "drifting prism terrace" spatial logic remains ambiguous past 120 words without serving closure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation debt triggers -0.4 penalty (facility revealed at 152 words), but Earned Stasis closure lands with conceptual cost: "ash can illuminate new horizons" reconfigures loss as illumination under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (bridge restoration crystallizing memory's fragility with rose-colored cost), but escalation lacks organic pressure—seeds translate flawlessly without resistance, missing a meaningful tightening before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) works under Accumulative lens but cost ambiguity undermines it—the washed-away ink carries no felt loss, violating cost proof test. Strong orientation early, yet tidal resolution lacks irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "voluntarily imposed distance now a conduit" crystallizes exile's transformation; nostalgia ban backstory violates BRR but doesn't break causality under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes but cost remains conceptual ("ledger of deeds forgotten") without legible on-page price. Accumulative lens holds, yet pressure lacks deepening driven by agency—the ritual's repetition feels predetermined, not earned through active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with the box's transformation and "felt cost" in Maren's "fire-scarred skin," but escalation lacks meaningful pressure tightening—the stakes remain abstract until the town square resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (hope made tangible), but the gauge's "singing" resolution feels unearned—pressure escalates through accumulating patterns without narrowing Arin's options. Lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the shared tokens transform legacy into communion with conceptual cost (individual burden → collective ritual), though the climate shift timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (mirrors showing doors) lacks visible cost; no on-page sentence demonstrates foreclosed path or price paid, violating Q2 cost proof test despite Accumulative/Textural lens coherence and prism parapet's Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (the "quiet ache" of redemption’s price crystallized in sword-laying), but celestial dance motif repeats without intensifying pressure, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the lingering echo reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("fragment of grace forged from cruelty"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shift at fracture moment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn") under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3, but "alarm of serenity" concept slightly asserted rather than fully earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "meteor hush that followed her steps" crystallizes the ethical storytelling shift with conceptual cost (ember as memory, not tool). Orientation anchors at 38 words; Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup to the string-reversal revelation, where pressure narrows options through the waning fire.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) valid but cost illegible; "structures dissolve with sunrise" states loss abstractly without on-page emotional or tactical consequence. Missing exact sentence where cost lands per rubric's cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (traveler's arrival proving memory's continuity) with felt cost (perpetual solstice duty), but the reflective block violates BRR by summarizing doubt without altering present tactics. Lens (Accumulative) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but cost proof fails—no on-page sentence shows sacrifice. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet storm pressure never concretely tightens tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation Test failure: unclear time anchor past 120 words ("waning amber of a dusk" insufficient). Closure (violet glow) lacks visible cost—no forfeiture or struggle—and feels coincidental rather than earned through causality, violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lens ambiguity undermines closure: Accumulative/Textural buildup (“shifting grace” density) conflicts with Situational pressure of the ritual. Cost is felt (“weight of anger dissolve”) but lens inconsistency past midpoint weakens causality. Strong Charged Poise ending, yet ambiguity triggers -0.4 deduction per guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with fog lifting to reveal trees, but cost remains abstract; "world expand" lacks visceral price despite strong Accumulative escalation through breath-fog-dream synchronization.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the lenses clicking reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("breach... nudged her toward deeper purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the cameo's void surging with "whispers of futures that had already happened" reconfigures inheritance with undeniable conceptual cost ("brightened disquiet"). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through bathroom breakthroughs to final constellation map.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "mountain exhaling" crystallizes stakes with felt cost of diary’s sacrifice. Under Accumulative lens, density escalates via botanical gaps → voids → symphony swell without causality breaks. Cost proof: "long held breath" image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation Test failure: unclear who/where beyond "mist clung to hull" at 120 words, triggering -0.5 penalty. Closure as Charged Poise (ship turning toward letter-stitched horizon) lands with conceptual cost ("weight and release of unkindled solace"), but causality is passive—ink river "spills," portal opens coincidentally. Lens (Accumulative) holds but escalation lacks protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tower's stillness crystallizes Mara's understanding of absence as bridges, with felt cost in the frozen clock hands. Orientation clear by line 3 ("dim heart of university clock tower"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rope reweaving deepens the "fables of absence" motif with escalating resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("ever ready to conjure another bloom of hush"), but escalation lacks causal pressure: energy beings depart without mapkeeper’s direct action, weakening "because/therefore" under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors solidly by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation succeeds early with "lone beacon tower" and "glass humming pavilion," but closure lacks legible cost. Charged Poise forms when the lantern "sputters, then steadies," yet no tangible price (physical/emotional) is dramatized for rekindling, violating cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (realizing conjecture bridges past/future) with felt cost (nostalgia→resolve). Lens ambiguity early (causal hints vs. accumulative payoff) slightly undermines escalation. Strength: 'fog thickened... lanterns flickered' tightens pressure under accumulative lens. Weakness: no meaningful mid-scene deepening beyond environmental shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the fortress holding "serious playful dream," but cost feels conceptual rather than visceral—no tangible price paid for the triumph beyond abstract "vow," weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when water brightens with new clarity during the thinning pause, crystallizing the cost of perceiving time's texture ("woven silk" sensation). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: ripple density intensifies pressure until the jade cicada's glow freezes the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "heart no longer cramped but expanding" crystallizes cost via spatial reconfiguration. Lens (Accumulative) holds; gravity snapback dissolves filaments with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the empty vial and passengers carrying "vaulting hush" show visible cost of silencing the world. Orientation is perfect within 120 words. Accumulative lens holds consistently through density buildup to silver cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density toward Earned Stasis. Sunrise deadline tightens stakes, but causality falters—mural "shivers" to reveal stairway feels convenient, not earned. Cost legibility weak; "weight lifted" lacks concrete on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (ring left behind), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) weakens escalation; "burning bridges" repetition dilutes pressure tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: diamonds' conditional permanence ("only endure while pressure remained tangible") crystallizes conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through pressure-density escalation. Minor causality gap between hesitation and bolt-securing action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative lens holds but cost legibility fails: "golden shadows deepen" is abstract, not concrete price. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lacks felt consequence despite thematic weight. Orientation succeeds early but payoff lacks tangible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (knight dissolving into orchard with "endless tomorrows"), but escalation under Accumulative lens feels gentle—no meaningful tightening of options despite vapor-bridge creation; cost (armor melting) visible yet weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (dust patterns rising for new file), but button's magic mechanics ("projected silhouettes") lack internal logic under Accumulative lens, weakening causality. Cost is felt ("heart stitching itself back together") yet not viscerally legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: key's final glimmer promises future resistance with visible cost ("battle would be long"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; "liquid memory" reflections create coherent pressure without causality breaks. Orientation anchors firmly by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via prophecy unraveling, but cost ("weight of unspoken promises") lacks concrete on-page manifestation; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with prism's refracted whisper charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: luminous leaf script crystallizes options with undeniable cost (Lira's permanent transformation); Accumulative lens holds throughout; felt cost legible in "forest's gratitude" and "prophecy fulfilled"; single deepening (decoding "home"/water) sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with cost ("fragmented self-knowledge" redeemed through gold seam), but the ritual's abstract stakes weaken tangible consequence. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet pressure lacks sufficient narrowing of options beyond internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost: Mara's softened ache and the tooth's glow reconfigure grief into hope. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (harp notes, laughter) tightens the dominant stake. Cost proof is legible in "ache in her chest soften," though emotional transformation could feel more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the strap's transformation, but the ultraviolet penance escalation lacks causal linkage—light flashes feel ritualistic rather than narrowing options until the crystal roots climax.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (fragment dissolving into shared memory), but felt cost remains oblique; accumulative lens holds though causal triggers for pattern convergence lack specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns deepen into beam diagram, calliope rhythm tightens focus. Charged Poise closure crystallizes when stars blink to barrel's rhythm—cost legible in "weightless burden transformed" with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures the library into portals, but conceptual cost ("fragile illusion" shattered) lacks felt weight—Mara's smile undercuts loss. Accumulative lens holds, yet cost isn't undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "fractured edge now a compass" crystallizes loss/creation with palpable cost in "burnished sorrow," though "time becomes visible" mechanics slightly blur causality under Accumulative/Textural lens dominant by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: covenant repaired but perpetually fragile, with conceptual cost ("any future dishonesty would cause it to wilt") made undeniable in the final image. Accumulative lens holds through rhythmic density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara's realization that explanations fail is a "state of quiet surrender" carries conceptual cost ("explanations dissolved"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density escalation to the water staircase.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise where the compass sculpture makes "learning never ends" legible with cost (scars as earned endurance), but turbine-hum sync with heartbeat feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (world's sigh reweights winter's end with felt cost of relinquished doubts), but orientation delay past 120 words (no temporal anchor beyond "winter's last snow") triggers −0.4 penalty despite functional disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the broadcast's ripple effect, but cost remains conceptual—no on-page sentence concretely shows Mara's sacrifice beyond "weight lifting," weakening Accumulative lens impact at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (emotional labor of remembering), but bottle dissolution to town revival lacks sufficient causal buildup. Accumulative lens holds, yet the transition from "cork dissolved into mist" to streets lighting up feels unearned by prior pressure, diluting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: prophecy reconfigured into cyclical promise with felt cost ("weight settle like dew"). Orientation solid early; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening to final ink-sealed vellum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the vanished cap triggers the phoenix's transformation and Mira's seed planting, with visible cost in the cap's absence and atrium's thaw; causality falters slightly as "decreasing entropy" remains conceptual rather than dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (retired rope secured in chest), causal lens holds through timer-driven progression, though "zero hour" slightly abstracts the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands via the tremor's "response" to compassion, crystallizing vulnerability's quiet strength; cost feels conceptual but the earth's pulse lacks visceral weight for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight settle like dust"), but escalation lacks density increase—ghosts and box patterns accumulate without meaningful intensification of pressure or narrowing options, weakening Accumulative lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost (time's irreversible transformation), but causality breaks in clue discovery: "midnight tea" ad appears coincidentally without prior setup. Escalation lacks meaningful tightening as pressure never constricts Mara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: feather settling reconfigures "woven dawns" into undeniable conceptual cost of embracing fragmentation. Accumulative lens holds with density shift in final image, though early disorientation risks orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the council lifts the time-limit decree, with visible cost in Mara's transferred vitality; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as copper-resonance density reweights stakes, though the council's sudden policy shift risks convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("home was not a place but a pattern"), but the felt cost of "surge of belonging" lacks concrete embodiment in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost ("reef’s death was a wound that could never fully heal"), but escalation relies slightly on external triggers (bird calls) rather than pure agency under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as Rook seals the leaf with "I will carry these voices," foreclosing personal closure for communal purpose. Minor causality slip: cylinder's "final line" appears convenient without earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when the compass needle shifts true north within dilated time, with visible cost in enduring the "blank map" reality; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as sensory density peaks during the star-sketching vision.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with spire's physical transformation, but "centuries-old betrayal" backstory fragment weakens causal chain; violet sky pressure accumulates effectively under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds perfectly: walking patterns deepen stakes toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "weight of gestures settle on her shoulders," though nomadic penumbra's mechanics slightly abstract the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully ("shape of home became a melody") with undeniable cost in shattered memory; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (feather strokes → corridor revelation) and coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: dissolving the pawn reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("lives lost in the cascade"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts, though the backstory block slightly overextends BRR limits without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("acceptance of loss"), but causality breaks: the ritual's resolution hinges on refracted echoes coincidentally transforming the spire, not Mara's agency. Lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet density lacks payoff—the "price" feels asserted, not earned through narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: acid sea’s roar muffled by narrative creates undeniable conceptual cost ("ceasefire between creation and destruction"). Accumulative lens holds throughout, with sensory density reweighting stakes via the statue’s voids filling with liquid light—a visible cost that seals doubts.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (isolated eternity), but the chest key's retroactive connection to hidden studio art breaks causality, weakening the "test" escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lacks visible cost—fisherman’s arrival resolves conflict via coincidence rather than Mara’s agency; "proof arrived on the wind" summary violates Q2 cost proof test despite strong Accumulative lens setup.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ships' arrival crystallizes the reverse migration's success with conceptual cost (absorbed sorrow in censer patina). Accumulative lens holds through moon-phase cadence shifts without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("greed eclipsed by sudden realization") under Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: virus backstory slightly explanatory rather than anchored in present micro-choices during Mara's confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (isolation transformed into witness), Accumulative lens held through tide-rhythm pattern; one decisive deepening (decoding pauses) reweights stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("final decision" weight), but orientation fails: "blooming cavern" introduced at 150+ words without prior signal, triggering -0.4 penalty and capping Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with legible cost ("dreams dissolved like frost"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—grotto sequence features no active opposition or trade-offs, weakening causal integrity under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation succeeds early with "ember nexus at twilight" anchoring setting. Closure as Charged Poise works—the persistent shell light against fading coals shows undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when the grave transforms into "a marker for stories yet to tell," with felt cost in the "shallow indentation" and "jealous echoes," though causality slightly softens the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds firmly; closure as Charged Poise ("world breathe anew") crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor deduction: fog's "trembling calm" repetition slightly dilutes the final image’s uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost (dissolving shards = released trauma), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks one decisive intensification to narrow options before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("weight of ash in every breath") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orchard's fall crystallizes irreversible stakes without soft reset, though axe timing slightly blurs cost immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing ("end of history was not a finality but a doorway") lacks legible cost—vanishing "like a breath of wind" feels consequence-free. Ambiguous Accumulative/Textural lens weakens escalation; disorientation serves theme but cost remains conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis ("horizon dissolved into pure light") reconfigures meaning but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; orientation succeeds early with horizon station, yet lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Situational) undermines escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure fails cost proof test: storm resolution lacks visible price ("farm survived untouched"). Drive lens ambiguity (hybrid but unresolved) and coincidence-driven solution violate "coincidence may complicate but not resolve." No legible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (theorem-writing) lacks visible cost—mother's heart attack is referenced but never dramatizes a trade-off; the "weight" is stated not shown. Accumulative lens holds but conceptual cost remains abstract, failing cost proof test at decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands as Mara realizes estrangement was communion, but cost ("core concept dissolved") remains abstract. The "concrete pulse" image hints at cost, yet lacks visceral legibility—no concrete consequence for Mara's life or method is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation perfect ("blooming jetty at twilight" anchors early), closure as Charged Poise crystallizes covenant renewal, but cost remains abstract ("reverence for tiny moments") without concrete on-page price. Escalation via tide turning lacks protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the chime’s "fleeting lift" crystallizes reciprocity’s cost—connection as ongoing labor, not magic fix. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density buildup to the final "less isolated" image with undeniable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with "map of her soul complete," but cost remains conceptual ("love, loss, hope") not legible on-page. Orientation test passed early with "blind mapmaker" and "ultrasonic forest" anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Valid Earned Stasis closure with conceptual cost ("echo lingered" makes permanent uncertainty legible). Accumulative lens holds through density increase in "luminescent buds" sequence. Minor deduction for no mid-scene setback testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with thematic weight but cost remains conceptual ("joyful sorrow") rather than legible on-page consequence. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently, though escalation lacks tightening pressure per Q4 constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (reborn mural crystallizes guardian stance with felt cost in "past judged his earlier sins"). Accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition, but "volcanic tenderness" borders on thematic echo, slightly muddying cost legibility at closure.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates through drumming intensifying garden responses. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (sorrow transformed to hope), but escalation lacks one decisive intensification narrowing options earlier in the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (key vibration, "labyrinth breathe with his rhythm") with conceptual cost, but map's self-reconfiguring path strains causality under Accumulative lens. Storm-driven escalation tightens meaningfully though the tunnel's sudden appearance relies on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric deepening, but closure lacks legible cost—fisherman's gratitude feels unearned rather than stemming from visible sacrifice. Orientation clear early, yet "reverent applause" resolution softens tension without concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("The quiet has spoken") lands with conceptual cost but causality breaks: window displays magically trigger sapling planting without resistance. Orientation succeeds early but escalation lacks tangible opposition under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of centuries lift"), but scrimshaw's hidden compartment lacks causal setup. Accumulative lens holds; whale call's resolution edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: "silence that now seemed less imposed" reconfigures the remade hush under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("effort of sustaining connection" implied in lingering echo), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural dominates yet "questioning assumptions" suggests Causal framing, weakening causality proof at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with legible cost ("tears not sad but grateful"), but two non-closure issues (abstract motivation escalation, momentum drag in crane-folding sequence) trigger -1.5 Accumulation Cap from 8.8 base.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the droplet’s "ripple a story waiting to be charted" crystallizes conceptual cost under Accumulative lens, though tape snap resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("heart heavy yet uplifted"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held via pattern-break escalation. Minor flaw: escalation lacks concrete price paid during attempt, weakening stakes depth.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: sunrise revelation reweights time as "a wound we could read" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout; "meteor hush" motif evolves meaningfully to final "radiance." Orientation clear by 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost ("weight of unsent affection") but escalation falters. Pressure grows through sensory accumulation yet lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Orientation strong but lens (Accumulative) coherence weakens during film-strip expansion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("sank to cold floor" exhaustion), satisfying Accumulative lens. However, escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the "rest" beat doesn't alter tactics ("merely a pause" undermines causal weight). Orientation strong but escalation insufficiently driven by protagonist agency under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the dune’s renewal, but the cost proof test fails—the guard’s persistent dreamlessness isn’t dramatized as a meaningful price paid. Accumulative lens holds, yet the felt cost remains abstract despite vivid imagery of ash-to-seed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("faint ridge of paper" as love's scar), but the accumulative lens lacks a persistent constraint shaping tactics; the cost proof is palpable yet narrowly contained.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with the lighthouse "humming" acknowledgment, crystallizing Elian's transformation. However, the descent into darkness lacks visible cost—his artistic breakthrough requires no tangible sacrifice or trade-off, failing the cost proof test for pinpointing legible consequences at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("histories erased like ink"), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—Accumulative/Textural only crystallizes late during ink patterns. Fails lens clarity check (-0.4), though cost proof ("paid the price of oblivion") is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (green shoots symbolizing hope's fragility), but the cost proof test fails—no exact line where Maren's personal sacrifice (frozen preservation risk) crystallizes beyond thematic assertion in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.9)
    No causal escalation or pressure narrowing options; the "tranquil blaze" refrain loops without deepening stakes, and closure lacks felt cost—Earned Stasis fails as no path is foreclosed with visible sacrifice beyond gentle reinforcement.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("kindness it received has become its own sun"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Hybrid) slightly weakens escalation; the thrum’s synchronization with breath is potent, yet the "resonant thrum" ending overstates earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: harbor’s "settled chorus" crystallizes Mara’s stance with felt cost (exposed heart now "rare peace"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density shift from "quivering hush" to "steady breath" reweights light’s value. Orientation clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with cost in "brittle awakenings... delicate beginnings," but the stone circle’s hum—key escalation mechanism—lacks setup, making its power feel unearned. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet non-closure accumulation (-0.8) caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: thread glow as "reminder that every secret is a strand." But escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mira passive as petal "detached without warning," breeze "stirred" lily pads. Accumulative lens holds, yet coincidence drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when the campus hums the subsonic chord—conceptual cost crystallized in "power plays lose their edge." Orientation anchors by word 15 ("old university radio station"), but repetitive "cautiously hopeful" phrasing slightly dulls the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("breath tighten" transforming into dissolving claustrophobia), but the spatial mutiny resolution lacks causal friction—the compass works too seamlessly, muting escalation stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise: stone tear glinting like "promise fulfilled" crystallizes cost of remembrance under Accumulative lens. Fissure revealing carvings risks coincidence but serves pressure intensification; cost ("dormant empathy awaken fully") is legible on final page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("spongey dread settle into resolve" foreclosing flight), but storm escalation feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens; jet stream shift lacks causal linkage to Mara's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (seed's inward hunger), but the Accumulative/Textural lens falters mid-scene where vortex mechanics lack causal linkage to the druid's chant. Cost proof weakens at "shards melt onto her palm."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visible cost in "hedges healed, their scars fading as new growth surged," but escalation falters—maze parts instantly with zero resistance, violating Accumulative lens demand for density increase. No meaningful tightening of options weakens pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation debt: "lone figure" and vague catacomb setting fail anchor test by 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty; closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ash→amber transformation), but felt stakes lack visceral weight at pivotal placement of the card in the hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is Charged Poise: "the next time I hear applause... will be the sound of purpose found" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("trembling," "buzzing doubt").

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("journey recorded not in triumphs but in soft affectionate detachment"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) past midpoint triggers -0.3 penalty despite functional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands weakly; "empty spaces remember" lacks felt cost—her smile at stitching light feels earned, not sacrificial, violating cost proof test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise—the mural holding amid collapse reconfigures stakes with visceral cost ("the sky inside seemed to inhale"), though the Accumulative lens weakens slightly when time pressure isn’t actively narrowed beyond pigment intervals.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the halo's intensification and engine sync crystallize options with visible cost in Lira's "quiet pride that balanced the sociable isolation," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through pattern-density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the vanishing act crystallizes stakes with palpable cost ("heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia"), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the library's transformation; the sunrise reweights prior frost with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (continuing the bell ritual) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence shows sacrifice. Orientation is strong (anchored by paragraph 1), yet nebula's "peak" timing lacks causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes time’s fragility through lullaby’s woven resonance, but conceptual cost remains abstract—no on-page price for borrowed pause despite "weight of lifetimes" hint.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("ash on tongue," cyclical burden), but frost deadline lacks dramatized escalation; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though time pressure feels undersold before the stump.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: the bridge's pulse embodies "loosened grief" while the child's chrysalis gift crystallizes the cycle of loss/reconnection. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through foam-to-polymer progression.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: child uncapping bottle crystallizes "silence into story" with visible cost (vendor's dissolved purpose). Orientation anchors by word 15. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation but "glimmering parole" concept remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise (fortress humming with "brittle resilience") lands with conceptual cost, but the cost legibility suffers from passive transformation—Lir's actions lack visible personal sacrifice, making the endurance feel unearned despite strong lens coherence (Accumulative/Textural).

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—bridges succeed without setbacks. Orientation strong (tower anchored by 42 words), but cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence showing paid price for unity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks concrete cost legibility; fading memories feel conceptual not visceral. Tremor escalation resolves too cleanly without altering tactics—no trade-off when Aria presses on. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof fails at dawn exit.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: the doodle fading and seedlings taking root show irreversible change with felt cost (Liora’s internal shift from latent to open flame). Orientation anchors (“City Library vaults,” “tonight”) land by 50 words. Gravity inversion creates tight causal pressure, but the stakes lack personal sacrifice beyond environmental challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as silence transforms into melody, but the conceptual cost remains abstract—no on-page image makes emotional toll undeniable (e.g., Auris's exhaustion or sacrifice). Accumulative lens holds via crack-decoding density, yet escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the glowing stone dent proves altered reality while exile's sorrow becomes a "compass." Orientation anchors by word 15; Accumulative lens holds through magnetic pulse cadence shifts that reweight the covenant's fracture into renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: fireworks moment crystallizes stakes with felt cost ("collective breath released"). Orientation anchors early; lens consistent from midpoint with density escalation via vibrational cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as villagers breathe the hush, crystallizing motion/stillness duality—but cost remains abstract (implied patience) without concrete forfeiture. "Felt cost" lacks unmistakable on-page proof in pivotal bloom moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure (Earned Stasis via tip dissolution) lands with conceptual cost (irreversible sacrifice for cyclical renewal), but lens wavers between Accumulative (atmosphere) and Causal until climax. Anchors clear by 100 words; soft reset glosses prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("weight of responsibility settle like a balanced scale"), but the wind release via whisper feels coincidental rather than earned by Accumulative/Textural lens pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("beauty could be both still and moving"), but cost proof is abstract; Accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks tangible pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: thunder's "low chord" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("true guardianship woven from quiet failures"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the seam-widening vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orientation fails early ("trembling dome of topaz workshop" lacks spatial anchors); closure lacks legible cost—the halo's cracking yields rewards (light cascade, collected shards) without sacrificing a path or showing consequence beyond aesthetic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: courier's physical absence versus lingering "humming light" legacy. Orientation solid by line 3, but shepherd scene lacks felt cost—wonder fades without consequence, weakening escalation stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "emotions did not merely pass through objects; they settled, colored, and altered them" with visible cost in "weight of responsibility." Accumulative lens holds—pressure deepens via "shifted hush" evolving to "chorus." Minor slip: engine sputtering feels coincidental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("amber bead now dimmed, its glow spent"), but puzzle-box discovery relies on coincidence that complicates without character-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong early anchors ("orchard planet," "meek blacksmith" by word 30) avoid orientation penalty. Closure is Charged Poise (blade cracking stone into vines), but cost proof fails—the memory trade has no felt consequence beyond abstract "pulse like heartbeats." Misses Q2 9+ gate due to cost ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost: shard fracture ("countless specks that drifted like stars") directly enables crew awakening. Causal lens holds tightly (shard redirect → slit → discovery → resolution), though merging realities via redirection lacks full foreshadowing in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stone spiral's pulse when lamp dies reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (light now carried inward), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors ("crumbling beacon," "haunted lantern room") by line 3 serve the disorientation payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: dissolved newspaper → algae-lit prophecy reconfigures "end of world" with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup, though cost legibility slightly falters at "shadowed brilliance" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "world seemed to hold its breath" crystallizes conceptual cost of bearing iridescent caution. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but escalation lacks deepening—sun trails merely illuminate more objects without narrowing options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: tower inhaling as last strand dissolves with visible cost (quantified sorrow lifting). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increase in dream-tracing reweights sorrow’s burden. Final image (world breathing relief) crystallizes stakes without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("weight of memories settle into purpose"), but cost proof is oblique. Accumulative lens holds though density increase lacks sufficient pressure tightening in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mirror reflection), but the attic-to-library transition lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens despite strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion" crystallizes options through the awakened slide's constellation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—frequency measurements tighten meaning-making pressure with each shift, narrowing options to the ledger's hum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: watch fob ticking metronome crystallizes truce fragility with felt cost ("seed of future conflict"), though sunrise deadline slightly softens tension; Accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as Arin's worldview shifts from skepticism to attunement, crystallized by the ring's glow syncing with aurora and forest vote. However, the conceptual cost (surrender of pure rationality) isn't anchored to a specific on-page image—fading aurora implies but doesn't *show* the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with Lena’s heart "untangling" into possibility, but the lock’s spontaneous alignment strains causality under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost feels conceptual, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with visible cost (toxic sky’s sting during passage, plate’s prior dullness), but council confrontation setup lacks payoff, capping high-band eligibility per gate rules.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise (sculpture's "slow heartbeat refusing darkness") reweights stakes but cost remains abstract—"color of wonder" preservation lacks concrete on-page price. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density buildup, yet "cost proof test" fails: no specific image/line shows paid cost, only hopeful assertion ("promise that symphonies... never silenced").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("static dissolve, replaced by fragmented wholeness"), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through sensory buildup to the final image of roses as compasses; magnetic shift timing slightly late but redeemed by dome shielding integration.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with sandstorm calm reconfiguration, but cost remains conceptual/oblique; no exact on-page sentence makes cost legible per Q2's strict proof test, preventing 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise (dice idle, lab rising) reconfigures meaning but lacks legible cost; no exact sentence shows sacrifice, violating cost proof test despite strong Accumulative/Textural lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("whale's silence would now rest in crystal chamber"), but cost proof is oblique—no exact sentence crystallizes forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative) holds through coffee-ground pattern escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: ritual succeeds without sacrifice. Orientation anchors by line 15 pass test, but Accumulative lens falters as pressure never tightens—no complication alters tactics. Cost proof test fails at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes: weekly lessons and "building itself could speak" reconfigure options with humility as cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—meteor intensification and sugar ritual deepen density without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (shell's dimming pulse = sacrifice of sorrow), but orientation fails—gender/location unclear past 120 words, capping potential; Accumulative lens holds though causality remains atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with Liora's vow, but cost remains abstract ("weight lift" without tangible consequence). Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) weakens escalation; the drip rhythm tightens pressure but key mechanics feel retroactively convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative lens holds with density increase (child's laughter → lover's sigh → lattice), but cost at closure ("quiet ache") is abstract, not legible on-page. No exact image anchors the price paid for dissolving echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (world "holding its breath"), but the exact cost legibility falters; the whisperer’s seamless success lacks visible friction despite strong Accumulative/Textural lens adherence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative lens holds but cost remains conceptual ("demure audacity") without concrete legibility. Closure (Earned Stasis) works, yet no exact sentence pinpoints paid price. Orientation anchors delayed but serve closure's whispering motif.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with cost (ferocious storm vs. fragile dawn), but causal thinness in Accumulative lens weakens escalation. Lens inferred early and held, yet pressure lacks meaningful tightening—rallying clans occurs off-page. Orientation anchors within 120 words, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Charged Poise closure succeeds with 'weight of centuries lift' as legible cost. Accumulative lens holds through sound-density escalation to child-sharing. Orientation clear by line 1; no causality breaks in payoff beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("tear... logical acknowledgment of beauty"), under Accumulative lens; density peaks via vibrational precision, though lens clarity arrives just past midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "reshape even the most rigid stone" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("impatient fire cooling to steady ember"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to the moon-surge beat; felt cost is legible in the ice's "crack... not of breaking, but of release".

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when water reverses, with palpable cost in the pipe's "low groan" and "collective gratitude" resonance; however, lantern's moisture-drawing property appears unearned, creating a causality gap that weakens Accumulative/Textural lens cohesion at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (apology now "pulsed through metal"), but "by the way light breaks" phrase acts as unearned coincidence twice, violating Accumulative lens by resolving pressure without causal buildup. Non-closure accumulation cap (-0.8) applies for two distinct issues.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Mara's bell-ringing forecloses the quest with visible cost (fleeting echo logged by algorithm), though the conceptual cost of "hearing the unheard" could be more embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orientation clear by line 3 (vaulted archives, hum of data). Causal lens holds: metadata → fabricated post → algorithm response → terminal discovery. Closure as Charged Poise ("absence transformed into quiet presence") with visible cost in Lia's vow to guard archives, crystallized by the crew's final message.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (world breathing in unison) with legible cost ("weight of unspoken hopes pressing against the ice"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though the "ancient method" introduction risks convenient resolution despite anchoring in dusty manuscript.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("grip on reality loosened like the lace tip slipping") under Accumulative lens. Orientation solid within 120 words; pressure tightens via sensory accumulation toward wind's "language" revelation. Minor deduction: epiphany slightly unmoored from prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure as letter dissolves into "dark root," cost legible in heat transfer to skin. Orientation debt (-0.4) from vague anchors past 120 words caps score despite strong final image reweighting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dunes shifting into footpaths crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("sand stretched beyond horizon"). Minor deduction for no visible stake escalation despite strong lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (tears/smiles), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural pressure isn’t fully taught until midpoint. Cost proof ("tears fell like dew") is legible, yet Earned Stasis hinges on convenient village arrival rather than Mara’s causal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise (leaving the folded page) reconfigures the library’s memory with conceptual cost—language’s fragility made undeniable by the crystal’s lullaby—but the cost isn’t pinpointed to a single visceral image, slightly diluting legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: dawn’s arrival crystallizes echoes as generative rather than futile, with cost in "forgetting was as inevitable as the tide." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, though "first light of dawn" slightly edges toward convenience without sufficient prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of centuries lift"); Accumulative lens holds through sound-density escalation to the leaf-triggered chime.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis (acceptance of transformation) with conceptual cost in "warm vinyl" testament. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "scent of hope" feels ungrounded until payoff, slightly weakening cost legibility at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—key winding down and island settling shows expended energy cost—but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful deepening; single tightening (rune completion) insufficiently narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "cleft now a gateway" and marrow's "new map of belief." Accumulative lens holds through vertebrae clicks becoming symphony notes, though no persistent constraint shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with spiral completion reweighting "light without fire" through "memory of forgotten star" cost; minor lens ambiguity in chant moment prevents 9.0 despite Accumulative density buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (pain transformed into "gentle knowledge"), but lens ambiguity between Accumulative/Textural and Hybrid slightly weakens causality at the drip-pattern climax where coincidence aids discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise works ("she would always swim against it"), but cost legibility falters—"weight of each hope settle into paper" feels abstract versus tangible forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds with density increase in cameo collection, yet final cost lacks pinpointable on-page anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with legible cost ("sealed vow" pollen settling on shoulders), but persistent constraint shaping tactics absent. Accumulative lens holds as moon's ascent tightens pressure via sensory density, though orientation clarity by line 3 avoids penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: covenant crystallizes options with felt cost ('seal holds only as long as she tends'). Accumulative lens holds through pattern density; orchard's shiver charges final cost. Minor slip: no visible consequence during sealing act weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("wounded season itself" stored), but the cost remains distant—no visceral moment where bruised world's pain physically or emotionally scars Corin during harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.7)
    Orientation test fails: who/where unclear past 120 words ("cavernous seashell" offers no spatial anchor), triggering -0.3 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("forgotten promise slipping into flame"), but Accumulative lens lacks meaningful pressure escalation beyond atmospheric density.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "loss can be a tool, not a trap" reconfigures meaning with felt cost in "weight of the ash wood carving blank now finished." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through steam→sap hardening density. Sap-to-amber transformation slightly convenient but cost legible in "invisible lines of time."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the lagoon's stilled water and ghost's fading smile crystallize Mara's acceptance of eroded ambitions with conceptual cost ("sprouting fresh roots"), but underutilized chronology confusion creates a non-closure flaw (-0.8 cap) as it never constrains choices despite early prominence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with terminal's hum, but conceptual cost of resurrected hope remains oblique ("quiet anthem" feels unearned). Orientation clear early; Accumulative lens holds with density increase in conduit rerouting.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("warm ember" replacing burden), but verbatim repetition of the rain-roof memory creates paraphrase loops that obscure causality and violate Accumulative lens coherence at the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    Orientation debt: "twilight barge canal" lacks geographic anchors past 120 words, capping Q3 at 7.0; closure (Charged Poise) has conceptual cost but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Situational) weakens causality in pivotal lock scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with "weight of centuries" but conceptual cost lacks on-page legibility; no tangible consequence for failure weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (endless work foreclosing rest), but the Accumulative/Textural lens weakens mid-scene as atmospheric buildup outpaces tangible pressure escalation on the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong accumulative lens builds pressure through sensory density, but closure lacks cost proof: phoenix instantly fixes systemic flaws with no sacrifice. "Flawed genesis" vanishes without struggle, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" rule—fatal for closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    Orientation debt: "scarred sky" and "black sand" obscure setting until paragraph 2, violating the 120-word anchor rule; closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—"weight of lineage lift" is abstract without embodied consequence, failing the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: geese departure crystallizes renewal with conceptual cost (Mara’s worldview shattered). Accumulative lens holds through breadcrumb density shifts; "sidereal patience" tightens tactics. Minor convenience in breadcrumb mechanics prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation debt past 120 words (nebula garden anchors vague until "star-woven vines" lacks spatial immediacy) triggers -0.4 cap. Accumulative lens holds but ambiguity at midpoint caps category; closure (Charged Poise revealing war shadows) has felt cost yet lacks causal pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Eliam accepts grief's "flowing tapestry" shape (coiled heart basin), with legible cost in "felt the weight." However, Mara's coincidental appearance violates Accumulative/Textural lens coherence by introducing unearned external guidance at the critical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "balance is a song sung together," but cost legibility fails—no concrete on-page price for Mara's act beyond vague "weight lifting." Pendulum physics ("halted during swing") breaks causality, undermining Accumulative/Textural lens coherence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "intention was a circle" reweights the premise with conceptual cost ("pressure of centuries condense"), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens; the cobalt silo’s pulse crystallizes stakes without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: cartographer’s humility crystallizes cost ("humbled by his own ignorance") while transformed spire charges the final image. Causal lens holds tightly from lattice diagram to barley harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dust tracing music lines crystallizes the hunger-for-stories stake with undeniable cost in "quiet pride." Accumulative lens holds throughout with luminous density tightening options, orientation clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: emotion "forever etched in stone" with felt cost ("crystalline chill," mask shattering). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through powder application to lattice formation, reweighting safety/stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with the cog's "common pulse" crystallizing abandonment of singular truth; cost is unmistakable in "agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful," with accumulative/textural lens holding through sedimentary rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "the journey was not a single performance but a continuous process" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost of perpetual unlearning. Accumulative lens holds cleanly, though escalation lacks sufficient resistance—the hatred "rusting away" feels under-earned despite the teacher’s methodical noise subtraction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with rust-to-ruby transformation showing cost, but celestial alignment resolution leans on coincidence rather than earned causality under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors within 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the drone's "Echo" revelation reweights the tower's purpose from utility to wonder-carrier with felt cost in Mara's confession of hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric pressure buildup to the glyph revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: final image reweights "hush" with conceptual cost ("silence as vivid as color"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts, though one tightening beat (shard placement) barely clears escalation threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("silence shifted," "breathed a sigh of brine"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—no narrowing of options or causal linkage under the accumulative lens, relying solely on atmospheric deepening without tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the chipped die's scar becomes "a faint scar turned triumph" reconfiguring perpetual motion. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mathematical density shifts; cost legible in "deliberate imbalance that paradoxically stabilized."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Mara’s continued painting after Jiro’s departure forecloses isolation with visible cost (her exhaustion, the smog’s "pulse less heavily"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost legibility in "city’s smog pulse less heavily" anchors conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: dread "melts like sugar" amid bittersweet acceptance, with conceptual cost of displacement legible in "imprint their initials upon the world’s crust." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with visceral cost: "hunger stone now dim" and vanishing into mist crystallize the conceptual price of rewriting fate under a clear Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost proof; "carry luminance forever" stated but not embodied. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost remains conceptual, not felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (orchard humming with "restless euphony") under Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increase through fractal patterns. But cost remains conceptual ("lingering hum") without concrete on-page price—no exact sentence where effort exacts physical or emotional toll, weakening the final image's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern escalation. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "city’s own willingness to listen" reframes premise. Final image crystallizes stakes without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sunlight freezing the ink crystallizes truth's emergence with undeniable conceptual cost ("noble lie dissolve... transformation into transparent honesty"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (ivy's retreat, glass shards dancing), and the 120-word orientation ("last petal fell... ivy strangled cracked platforms") anchors without disorientation penalty. One tightening—dismantling the lie without shattering hope—narrowing options sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Mara's whispered vow crystallizes commitment with visible cost (river's sigh acknowledging her oath), under Accumulative lens. Escalation is subtle—single deepening via ink bleeding as "quiet fire"—but sufficient for length; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (truth as foundation), but cost proof fails—no exact sentence anchors emotional/relational price paid. Orientation is clear early, yet blackout’s pressure doesn’t meaningfully narrow options beyond Mara’s intellectual pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in "heart that ascends while descending," but escalation lacks pressure tightening under Accumulative lens. Cost proof fails: "grief begins to dissolve" lacks concrete on-page price—no forfeiture or adaptation. Shadow detachment triggers action but doesn't narrow options. Orientation clear by para 2.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("harmony coaxed from cosmos"), but causal links between star trails and chip activation lack motivation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though causality thinness caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("weight of that withheld truth had finally been lifted"), but the "promise to pay enough gold" motivation remains underdeveloped, failing to constrain tactics despite early signaling, weakening causal escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the untethered rope’s 'forgotten promise' and dissolving mist crystallize the cost of releasing guilt, though the moon-phase synchronization feels more atmospheric than causally tight under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens—the steady ember reweights regrets with conceptual cost—but reflection on crew abandonment slightly overextends BRR limits without altering present tactics beyond initial course-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "trusting dirty past as compass not chain" crystallizes stance with felt cost of "feeling weight of sorrow"; Accumulative lens holds via patterned imagery tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with legible cost (bark patterns), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density increase—ritual proceeds procedurally without narrowing options or deepening pressure before the stag's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet" transforming into redemption), but vapor staircase emergence lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens, preventing 9.0+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "resolve as cold as the void" and ship's emptiness after Nara's step through. Accumulative lens holds through shimmer-to-garden intensification without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (Mara’s future charity gains "uncanny timing"), but fisherman’s prophecy revelation strains Accumulative/Textural lens via coincidence. Orientation clear by line 3, though volcanic rumble escalation lacks causal link to her transformation realization.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (fort's "new whispered rhythm") with conceptual cost of revolution's quietness, but no exact on-page sentence shows Kael's personal cost. Orientation is solid by word 10, yet escalation lacks tightening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (patterns malleable), but "weight settled like a mantle" abstracts the price. Strong orientation anchors by line 5, though cost lacks concrete image like trembling hands from visions.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("terrain to be traversed"), but escalation remains atmospheric—no narrowing of options or knowledge shift under Accumulative lens. Storm intensification doesn't reweight stakes beyond sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing when the philosopher locates understanding "in the space between their fencings," with conceptual cost legible in the needle card's transformation. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) slightly weakens causality in escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure fails Cost Proof Test: no on-page sacrifice for the “luminous fracture” glow-up. Resistance blooms effortlessly (seeds sprout, travelers arrive) without narrowing options or felt cost. Orientation Test violated—“as the moon clears the skyline” repeats without temporal stakes, leaving “when” ambiguous past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis (clock's final tick) with conceptual cost, but "horizon invites night" timeframe lacks causal pressure. Disorientation serves closure but escalation feels atmospheric rather than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "weight of storm/lightness of hope" crystallizing stakes; monsoon deadline creates visible cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through ridge's physical response to translations.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lacks legible cost: the compass aligning with "cerulean regret" feels earned but offers no visible sacrifice or irreversible change. "Sorrow loosening" is abstract, failing the cost proof test at the ending beat where concrete loss must anchor redemption.
