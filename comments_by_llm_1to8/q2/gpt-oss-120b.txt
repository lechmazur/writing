    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, Mara, post-flood). The piece accumulates textural pressure through weeks of observation, and the final whisper to the vines offers a mild Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via acceptance of gradual change). Cost is implied rather than sharp: Mara releases her need for dramatic answers, but the narrative tells us this shift more than it dramatizes a foreclosed option or a felt sacrifice in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through frost/glass/ledger motifs). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elya discovers purpose in pauses), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift is dramatized on the page. The ledger-to-glass journey unfolds through serial discovery rather than because/therefore causality, which fits the lens but never tightens into a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the heat-mapping device and tuning fork build through layered sensory and thematic recurrence toward the final chord. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the conservatory exhales, silence becomes song), and the cost is conceptual—her survival redefined as ongoing witness rather than mere escape. However, orientation is delayed (winterglass conservatory, Mara's survivor status, and the device prototype all land within the first third but without crisp spatial anchors until mid-piece), and the weeks-later coda summarizes pilgrimage rather than dramatizing a final on-page stake shift, softening the cost's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—who Marlow is beyond "undertaker," why this package matters, and what "after the mysterious package arrived" stakes are never anchored concretely. The closure dissolves Marlow "beneath the waves," but no on-page cost is legible: we see no decision that forecloses a path, no renunciation with price, only lyric merging. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image recycles prior diction ("occupying impossible space," "chased stillness") without a decisive reweighting or felt sacrifice that distinguishes before from after.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece delivers an Earned Stasis frame (community endurance through repeated bell-ringing) with no decisive change, reversal, or crystallized cost on the page. Closure requires visible, felt, or conceptual cost; here the final paragraph repeats the opening's tone and activity ("the bell's song faded into memory, ready to be rung again") without reweighting stakes or foreclosing an option. Under an Accumulative lens, the story would need a pattern break or cadence shift that charges the final image—none appears. The orientation is established late (~"ridge," "arbor," "sanctions" all front-loaded abstractly), and the link between anonymous donations and the bell's signal remains causally vague (how do volunteers know what to collect, when, or where to deliver beyond "the hollow"?). The ending simply loops back to the beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (unused love released as visible current), but causality is declared rather than earned: Milo's breathing and lens placement produce results without resistance or tradeoff. The orientation is delayed (past life memory surfaces, viaduct location, character name scattered across the first third) without clear anchors by ~120 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (breath → fog → tunnel → lattice), yet each step unfolds as inevitable narration rather than pressure-driven discovery. Cost is asserted ("healing was not a single act") but not legible in a forfeited option or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are named early, penalty waived. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural by ~40% (pattern of dissolution, fragments, hyperbolic geometry). However, no on-page closure unit is legible: the maze is described as "complete" and Mara "watches" and "whispers" thanks, but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing occurs—the final state is presented as achieved via summary rather than a crystallizing image or choice that reweights prior material. The phrase "stood complete—a reverie that quaked" asserts completion without showing a before/after moment or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story anchors who, where, and when within the opening and proceeds through a clear sequence: carnival → puzzle → vault → planting. Closure arrives on-page with the seed shoot breaking through soil, supported by the wall's collapse—a Resonant Reconfiguration (CR: "wall comes down, seed shall rise") that reweights the vault legend from myth to living truth. However, the causal chain feels more illustrative than pressured; each step (arrow, bench, door) unlocks mechanically without cost or complication, and the rumble/wall collapse reads as thematic echo rather than earned consequence of Mara's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, where precisely she stands, and what immediate problem she faces remain vague past the opening third. The dominant stake—imprinting memory into a device—never narrows options or encounters resistance; she collects, records, completes, and returns without reversal. No on-page cost or decisive change occurs; the device "sang" and she "smiled," but nothing was foreclosed or reweighted. The ending recycles the opening premise ("trust breaking and mending") rather than delivering closure under any legible lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece offers no on-page closure with visible cost: Lira's whispered promise to the lantern is assertion, not a decisive change, renunciation, or earned reconfiguration. Spatial orientation drifts—grand hall, tunnels, jade door, cavernous library—without clear transitions or consistent anchoring, breaking the Orientation Test by ~120 words (−0.4). The Drive Lens remains ambiguous throughout; no causal because/therefore linkage drives escalation, no accumulative density reweights stakes, and situational pressure never crystallizes into stance. The ending describes traveler reactions rather than landing a closure unit with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where early, but the "when" (day vs. season) and spatial scale remain vague past the 120-word gate; no penalty applied because disorientation is mild and does not obscure closure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through repeated motifs (bookmark, glass, thaw). However, no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs; Mara's final whisper recaps her stated purpose without a visible cost or foreclosed path. The closure unit lacks a legible before/after with felt price, so RR/CR does not land. Escalation is accumulation of imagery rather than tightening of options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the story oscillates between causal puzzle-solving (cipher, lever) and lyric accumulation (stars, dust, amber) without teaching a coherent pattern. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("fearless, forever changed") but lacks visible cost; the leap to "hovering on the edge of the universe" is metaphoric assertion, not an on-page reweighting with felt consequence. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives late—library identity and Mara's stunt-double role emerge piecemeal past the opening 120 words, though not fatally obscure. Applied −0.3 for orientation drift and −0.5 for cost ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and recurring motifs ("marbled hush," "ambered hush," star) layer without causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague past ~120 words; apply −0.4. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (map dissolves into air), but no on-page cost is legible—the oracle "stood unshaken," and the dissolution feels ornamental rather than a foreclosure of options or a reweighting with felt price. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who the POV is emerges only by the third sentence; "where" and "when" anchor by the second paragraph. The piece attempts Conceptual Repricing (the janitorial duty becomes a ritual of synthesis), but the closure unit consists of philosophical summary ("the robot's processors hummed a soft affirmation") rather than a dramatic reweighting with legible cost. Causality is present in outline—second chance program → curiosity module → violin experiment → realization—but key turns (the violin "responded," the robot "felt") are told rather than dramatized with concrete sensory or perceptual shifts. The story reads Accumulative/Textural in method but does not achieve a cadence shift or density break that charges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who (Mara), where (forecourt), and when (after rain, dusk) anchor by ~60 words, waiving the penalty. However, causality is opaque: cryptic doodles "lead her" to the theater without shown decision-making; the lens "amplifies the trembling honesty of the walls" through undefined mechanics; projections cause townspeople to "understand" off-page. The closure unit—townspeople gather, see lingering light, understand honesty freed them—occurs off-page and is summarized rather than dramatized with visible cost. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost is legible. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of light/honesty images) but the final reweighting lacks an on-page moment where cost or pressure crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but the timeframe "after luck becomes measurable" and "probability as a bright gauge in the sky" remain ornamental abstractions never integrated into causality. The piece offers no meaningful escalation: polishing marbles unlocks pathways and finally a clearing with zero resistance or cost. The garden "responds" and "affirms" without the protagonist earning change through renunciation or trade-off. Closure reads as reward rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation arrives late: who Lira is and what she seeks emerges gradually across the first third without clear anchoring by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural design, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost occurs—Lira completes her experiment successfully, smiles, and continues her duties. The ending offers thematic reflection ("time could indeed be nudged sideways") but no on-page closure unit that forecloses a path or reweights prior material with visible price. Causality is loose: the lever pull causes amber arcs and bud unfurling, yet no constraint, sacrifice, or trade-off shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of water damage → marginalia → ghost code → played note → symbols revealed → ghost satisfied. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note produces the water-ripple shift revealing the final stanza. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (ghost's satisfaction, program dries, lanterns steady), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or price paid by Mara on the page that the reader can point to in a specific sentence. The lens holds, but the closure lacks the felt or visible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through linked images (fever → illustration → smudged ink → barometer reading) toward a moment where truth "settles" and sorrow "fades into resolve." The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (resolve to carry truth outward), but cost remains conceptual and implied rather than undeniably legible in a final image or forfeited option. Orientation anchors (weather station, dawn, Mirela alone) appear early. The meaningful deepening occurs when the barometer reading "matched the weight of a stone," but this feels declared rather than earned by a visible turn or narrowed option that the reader witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt is severe: POV gender, physical grounding, and immediate goal remain unclear past 120 words; Mara's name and the valve-wheel objective emerge only after sustained atmospheric wandering. Closure—leaving the wheel—lacks visible cost; no on-page option was foreclosed, no tactic altered. The piece gestures toward Conceptual Repricing (truth as weight), but the final image ("quiet prayer he never intended to utter") replaces scene pressure with abstraction, and no felt price anchors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds toward the refuge immersion. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the keeper steps into the refuge and writes "silence births renewal"—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible in a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. One tightening (the descent) occurs, meeting minimum escalation, but causality is loose: the origami guides via metaphor, not mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors (Liora, Sage Ridge, eclipse approach) land cleanly by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and lyric recurrence build toward the eclipse moment, then the final image of Liora watching from the ridge years later attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, no on-page cost is legible—Liora's legend status and the village's ritual adoption of curls feel like rewards, not foreclosures, and the "cautious exuberance" refrain does not reweight prior stakes with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (historian collecting fragments toward a pattern). Orientation anchors arrive late: "odd historian" and "reclaimed silo library" lack spatial grounding until the tapestry and fire pit appear mid-paragraph; who/where remains hazy past 120 words (−0.4 in Q2, cap Q3 at 7.0 per Orientation Test). Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("displaced axis is not a fracture but a realignment"), but the cost is conceptual assertion only—no visible forfeiture, no tactic change, no felt price on the page. The humming and vibration are atmospheric touches that do not narrow options or charge the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains foggy past 120 words: who the protagonist is beyond his occupation, when "tonight" occurs relative to his years of work, and why spycraft microdot specs arrive now are never anchored concretely. The drive lens oscillates between causal (microdot technique enables cookie encoding) and accumulative (lyric recurrence of "open secret," lighthouse beam), never stabilizing by midpoint or closure. No decisive change occurs on the page; the ending asserts a "quiet revolution" and strangers' rewired lives without showing the cost or consequence that would constitute closure. The single beat—examining specs, applying them to cookies, visitor cracks one—lacks the because/therefore linkage or meaningful tightening required under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but remain vague: "waning cathedral that floated between worlds" and "dimensional anchor" establish setting without concrete spatial grounding by ~120 words. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with lyric compression, but the closure unit—the anchor steadying and the priest walking into light—lacks felt cost; the "possession waned" and "stillness shattered" are declared outcomes rather than on-page decisive changes with visible price. The loop pedal ritual generates atmosphere but does not narrow options or foreclose a path with dramatized consequence. Drive lens is accumulative but the ending reconfiguration feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes who (Lian), where (glass spire by frozen lake), and when (dawn) within the opening lines, satisfying the Orientation Test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (nautilus alignment, frost-etched score, mirrored horizon fracture) toward a final cadence shift where the frozen lake shimmers with color and Lian seals the glass fortune cookie. That final image reweights her stance from longing to conductor, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains oblique—there is no legible forfeiture, renunciation, or visible price paid on the page; the transformation is atmospheric rather than materially grounded. The lens holds, but the closure feels conceptual rather than felt, weakening the band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=2.8)
    No legible closure unit exists: the protagonist does not make a decision, endure with cost, or crystallize stance. The tablet "dissolving into particles of light" is handed to him by authorial fiat, not earned by prior causality. Orientation is vague past 120 words (who is he? why now? what changed today?). The inferred lens is ambiguous—lyric texture without accumulative pressure or causal linkage—and never coheres at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who: Marin; where: cavern; when: vague seasonal frame) arrive early enough. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mood, image, and metaphor build until the final mirrored-hush moment. However, the closure unit—Marin rewinds the needle, songs play forward, numbness dissolves—lacks a visible felt cost on the page; the "key" metaphor suggests resolution without sacrifice. The middle deepening (backward songs → forward songs) narrows options slightly but reads more like a procedural unlock than a consequence-laden turn. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Marin loses or forecloses by her action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.1)
    The closure—dropping the tube into the hidden shaft—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than felt in the moment. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens through recurring atmospheric detail, but the final act does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it resolves a logistical puzzle the quarantine posed without altering Elara's stance or options in a legible way. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (courtyard, dusk, Elara), so no penalty applies there.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: who, where, and when remain hazy past 120 words (−0.4). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the poet explores, traces patterns, and weaves the rope without facing a narrowed choice or cost that forecloses a path. The final binding is declared rather than earned causally; the prose asserts resonance ("walls seemed to breathe") without showing what the poet lost or risked. Closure lacks visible or felt cost, reducing the ending to atmospheric summary.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who (violinist), where (greenhouse/bonfire), and when (tonight/dusk) anchor by the opening lines; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (bowl, fire, shipwrecks, vines) and the final image reweights the hush into "a space waiting to be filled." However, no decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or conceptual cost appears on the page. The violinist plays, the bowl hums, the villagers feel curiosity, and she walks away with "infinite grace"—a mood shift without visible or felt price. Closure form fails the definition: no before/after legible with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. However, the piece lacks a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: Mara begins harvesting emotions and ends planning to harvest more, with no on-page alteration of stakes, options, or stance. The process unfolds as a illustrated procedure rather than a causal chain where choices narrow options or impose felt cost. Under a Causal lens, no because/therefore linkage changes Mara's situation; under an Accumulative lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors land by ~120 words, waiving the penalty. However, no meaningful closure unit appears on the page. The locket placement on the balcony is presented as completion, but no before/after change in Mara's options or stance is legible—she begins wanting to share stories and ends sharing stories with no cost, renunciation, or reconfiguration. The misdelivered envelope resolves itself through convenient cooperation (the keeper simply agrees, the photo's backstory is revealed off-stage). Drive lens reads Causal by intent but linkage collapses into and-then sequencing; the keeper's immediate agreement and the town's next-morning gift parade erase friction. The final ceremony is summarized rather than dramatized, and no visible or felt cost attaches to any image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but closure arrives as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with felt cost. The search for the tag, the villagers weaving reeds, and Arlen's vow occur in quick succession without causal pressure tightening options. Orientation is delayed past ~120 words (marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline orchard, crater rim established piecemeal), triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The ending adds a child discovering a new fragment, but this micro-turn does not reweight prior material or make a before/after legible with cost; it reads as additive rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within tolerance, but causality remains decorative: the pendant glows, a bridge appears, echoes swirl, and Mira "understood"—all without because/therefore linkage or motivated ellipsis. The closure image (pendant dissolving, rhythm restored) asserts resolution without demonstrating a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the final walk back erases the journey's tension. No persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the "interrupted cadence" functions as atmosphere rather than a forcing mechanism. The drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (lyric density) and Causal (quest structure) but neither holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation remains vague: we lack concrete spatial anchors (cavern depth, orchard size, proximity of bridge to grove center) and temporal grounding beyond "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon." The conjurer's sequence—place eyes, trace mosaic, record numbers, lift eyes, walk away—reads as ritualistic outline without causal linkage; nothing he learns changes his next move. No reversal or tightening occurs: he arrives with a plan, executes it without friction, and departs satisfied. The "ambiguous loss" transforms into "new addition" by assertion in a summary sentence rather than through on-page discovery that alters his stance or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. The ending declares visibility achieved but lacks visible cost or a before/after that the reader can trace in Maren's options or stance; she "steps forward" and "smiled" without forfeiting a lived-in alternative. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sensory pattern, resonance motifs), yet no decisive cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure—"sapphire hush" recurs as decoration rather than a charged turn. The tape-reel discovery and circuit completion unfold without setback or tightening that narrows her path, reducing closure to summarized outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is anchored (Marlowe, nursery, post-rain, storm season) within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers observations and minor interventions (copper coil, mycelium, greenhouse) without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the lesson "sustainable growth thrives on letting nature reconstruct by releasing control," but this thesis is told rather than demonstrated with visible cost—Marlowe builds more infrastructure (greenhouse, bowls of rainwater) in the final paragraph, which contradicts "releasing control." No on-page moment shows a path foreclosed or a price paid; the leaf simply greens and the story summarizes the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors appear early (Keralan, post-war, Mara). The convergence functions as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is unclear: Mara "surrenders" her paintings in exchange yet returns to paint again with the brooch above her easel, suggesting no actual loss. The causal chain from rain trail → brooch → altar → convergence reads more as a treasure-hunt checklist than because/therefore linkage driven by protagonist agency. The final image of the tide rising offers atmospheric closure but the stakes-alteration remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Lira is and why she seeks the pearl emerge slowly through ornamental description. No on-page decisive change occurs; the pilgrim arrives, Lira whispers, the pearl glows, and a child appears, but no before/after choice or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending loops back to thematic summary ("unseen forces…can magnify the magic") without a legible closure unit. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Situational, yet neither pays off in a crystallized final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph (ocean-spray archivist, ivory harbor after rain, post-exile). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the archivist gathers fragments across beats, the valve absorbs stories, and the harbor becomes a communal chorus. However, no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost is legible at closure. The final beat—setting out aboard a sloop—reads as continuation rather than a crystallized shift in stakes, options, or meaning. The ending claims connection but does not reweight prior material or foreclose a path with visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story signals closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist steps into the role of conduit and promises to return), but the cost is abstract: no before/after option is foreclosed on the page, and the "promise" remains a declaration without visible sacrifice. Causality chains exist (clue → arrows → vault → ledger), yet each beat unfolds as a guided tour with no reversal or tightening that narrows her choices. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative lens early but never deepens pressure or reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. The orientation anchors arrive late (vault interior ~40% in) and the "hour that divides" timeframe is mentioned twice without constraining a single tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece follows a single continuous accumulation: Lira discovers the tile, watches it shift, transcribes verses, and places it in an alcove. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the tile cooperates throughout. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration language ("unheard symphony she had been chasing was not a sound to hear but a feeling to inhabit") but no on-page cost is legible—no choice forecloses a path, no felt price appears in the final image. Orientation is present by ~120 words (tower, cliff, night), so no penalty there, but closure under an Accumulative lens requires visible cost or a cadence shift that reweights the stake, neither of which lands.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within acceptable range. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the amulet fragment threading through beats, but the closure effect—"goodbye to his former emptiness"—is told rather than shown with legible cost on the page. The spatial mutiny and corridor sequence provide pressure, but the resolution ("no longer bored") asserts change without a decisive image or action that makes the before/after felt. Cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Conceptual, seeking a Conceptual Repricing where the ink's contract transforms bureaucratic rigidity. Orientation anchors arrive by paragraph two (Mara, prep room, ink pot, asylum motive). The closure unit—ink contract sent, officials' walls dissolve—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized: we're told the equations "glowed" and walls "dissolved" without showing the officials' reaction or Mara's tangible sacrifice. The breach and liquefaction metaphors drive the structure, yet the final beat summarizes transformation rather than enacting it with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words with dense figurative language obscuring who/where/when; this triggers the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural (collecting textures, prismatic light patterns) and thematic meditation without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint. No meaningful closure: the final paragraph restates the opening premise ("invented histories," "refract," "chart") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. The stationer walks deeper into the labyrinth ready to repeat the same action—a loop, not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator accepts the role of keeper), but no on-page cost is visible: the label is pocketed, the tide recedes, and the protagonist walks toward the exit with renewed purpose rather than forfeiting a live option. The accumulative lens is signaled (fragments layered, voices stitched), yet the ending offers affirmation without pressure or tradeoff, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who/where/when are not anchored until multiple sentences in, and "inside the whisper of closing pages" remains metaphorically opaque throughout (−0.4). The piece offers no decisive change: Selene arrives seeking an answer, finds it via convenient props (shell → cello → ledger), and departs with the same curiosity she began with. The "answer" that myths survive through retelling is told, not earned by on-page pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the cello hums, the ledger reveals, and the protagonist exits unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is met, but the "when" remains vague (pre-privatization feels like setting rather than a ticking clock). The drive lens wavers—causal setup (foundation chip → graffiti → layout shift) competes with accumulative/textural carnival texture, and the ending opts for a summary resolution ("council postponed privatization") that occurs off-page, robbing closure of on-page cost. The phoenix mural and glass-cased chip are asserted to carry weight but arrive as decoration rather than a dramatized turn that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid in the final image; Mira "breathes out" in relief without renouncing an option or suffering a felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (chemical timer triggers shutter at sunrise) but the closure—packing the canister and descending—reads as mission completion without visible cost or foreclosed path. The ending whispers a hope ("May the grain's story travel") but does not dramatically reconfigure the inspector's stance or options; the archivists' future reaction is told, not shown. Orientation is prompt (moonlit summit, space age, inspector's mission brief by the second sentence), waiving the Orientation Test penalty. The chemical-reaction setup earns causal linkage, but the final image lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory detail and motif (mist, light refraction, hummingbird) toward a final image of restored function and future promise. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the patch adheres "with a quiet sigh" without friction, and the ending recycles earlier mood rather than reconfiguring it with cost. Closure reads as affirmation, not transformation or renunciation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Mara discovers the condensation pattern, aligns the transmitter, and the signal triggers the bell and thaw. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the ice cracks, the falcon circles, and Mara prepares to map the convergence—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt (no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens holds, but the final image reweights meaning more than it imposes a legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.1)
    Who, where, and when anchor tolerably early (tuner, plaza, pre-collapse dawn), but no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs. The tuner begins rebuilding and continues without obstacle, reversal, or changed knowledge; workers arrive on cue and the town completes itself in a single glide. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("spirit renewed," "shared balance they now protected") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, Situational—the ending remains a tableau without on-page pressure or forfeiture that would constitute closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "distress signal sender" and battery status appear in the HUD, but who Mara is and why she's alone remain vague until the mid-story motivation reveal. The closure unit—releasing the vial on shore—lacks visible cost; Mara keeps the vial, returns with fresh tributes, and suffers no dramatized consequence. Causality is weak: the temple "demands a price," she lets the beacon fade, yet she surfaces safely with the vial and later uncorks it at will. The lens appears accumulative (hush, perfume, memories layering), but the final release doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it simply fulfills the stated intention.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words (who is the boy by name or age, when is this occurring, what immediate threat drives him). The Drive Lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught early or held at closure. The ending declares transformation ("legend transformed into a guiding light") without an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible with felt cost. No specific choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit: the bride simply "fades" after a breath that causes blossoms, with no before/after alteration in her options, knowledge, or stance. The narrative is pure accumulation of metaphoric description without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes cost visible. Orientation remains vague—who she was, when this occurs, and spatial anchors dissolve into endless abstraction. Causality is absent; events happen in parallel poetic register without because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece opens with atmospheric description and delays who/where/when anchors past the ~120-word mark; "poetic wharf weaver" and "labyrinth" are named early but their spatial and temporal relationship remains vague until mid-story, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). No meaningful tightening occurs: the weaver begins sewing, continues sewing, and ends sewing with escalating declarations of success but no on-page reversal or complication. The closure unit—travelers guided, guildmasters humbled—is summarized rather than dramatized, and no felt or visible cost appears; the final image ("continued to sew the world's wounds") restates the premise without reconfiguring it.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors early (diaspora returnee, catacomb orchard, excavation mission). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fragments gathered, altar assembled, roots respond, voice rises. The closure unit—altar complete, voice thanks, dawn breaks—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (faith restored, interrupted journeys merged). Cost is conceptual (patience, reverent pause) but not viscerally felt on the page; no tactical choice narrowed by a prior failure or price paid in stamina, doubt, or loss. The sequence coheres but the tightening remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a coherent drive lens—it drifts between descriptive catalog (arcade machines, chalk symbols) and vague conceptual claims ("transmission of marginal thoughts") without establishing causality or accumulative pressure toward a legible closure. The ending presents completion of a ritual with no visible cost, no reversal, and no reweighting of prior stakes. Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what concrete problem she faces remain unclear past the 120-word mark, warranting the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The story reads as a single illustrated concept rather than a narrative with before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who she is, her precise spatial position, and the timeline anchor emerge slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern (−0.4). The "adjacent possibilities" mechanism remains abstract; the story tells us she imagines scenarios (the clerk, the governor's aide) but these visions do not alter her on-page tactics or narrow her options in a causal chain. The closure—finishing the tapestry and sending it via courier—occurs, but the cost is conceptual and unanchored: we do not see what she sacrifices, what path she forecloses, or how the act changes her situation with felt pressure. Under a causal lens the linkage is weak; under accumulative the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres—beats loop through similar gestures (place shard, moonlight strikes, condensation forms, spirits sing) without meaningful tightening or cost. The Orientation Test anchors who/where by ~120 words, waiving that penalty. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("the apology had never needed words") but the realization lands as narrated epiphany rather than an on-page shift that forecloses a path; the medium emerges unchanged, carrying the shard forward with no visible price paid. The "moment before deciding" is never crystallized into a legible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: WHO (translator), WHERE (atrium), WHEN (twilight, after anesthetic) anchor by ~120 words—waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mist/coral/notes accrue symbolic weight). Closure unit: the droplet onto the plaster is offered as Resonant Reconfiguration, but no decision, renunciation, or foreclosed path appears on the page; the translator "walks away feeling" is summary, not a dramatized change. Cost is asserted ("would not heal instantly") rather than shown. The anesthetic deepening and the child's passive acceptance provide no reversal or tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately in the opening lines. The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost; the orchard transitions from fog-shrouded to luminous through the artist's unobstructed work, but no option is narrowed or forfeited on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending adds brightness without a pattern break, cadence shift, or reweighting that makes a before/after legible with cost. The knowledge network and fresco fragment appear as texture but do not constrain tactics or alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes setting and character by the opening, meeting the orientation window. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: the narrative gestures toward accumulative/textural patterning (sound waves, nested awakenings, reflected echoes) but never tightens options or stakes in a way that makes before/after legible. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing attempt—the hobo nickel as conduit, curiosity over certainty—but the conceptual cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page. I cannot point to a specific sentence where Lena loses, renounces, or pays a felt price; she simply smiles and walks on, her "old certainty drift[ing] away" without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—no clear "when" anchor, and "after thoughts become taxable" remains a conceptual backdrop rather than a dramatized constraint shaping the present scene. The story offers sequential elaboration (seed planted → whispers → Dr. Mirabel enters → club emerges → alliance forms) without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. Closure reads as expansion and alliance rather than a decisive change or renunciation with legible cost; the final image promises future rebellion but does not land a felt price on the page. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough; no penalty applied. However, no closure unit is legible—the poet's verses "photosynthesize" across centuries without a decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The "blossom armistice" arrives as prophecy fulfilled, not as a turn driven by choice or cost. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift narrows options or charges the final image with undeniable pressure; the story simply completes its announced arc.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed and atmospheric—who, where, when coalesce slowly through metaphor rather than concrete anchors by ~120 words, creating mild drift (−0.3). The piece accumulates texture but delivers no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost; the traveler's arrival and departure leave the caretaker's situation and options unchanged. The final paragraph restates the opening ritual ("refilled the candle, whispered a new name") without tightening, deepening, or reweighting stakes. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure unit fails to land a cadence shift or density break that charges the final image with felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but no on-page closure with felt cost is legible. The transcription succeeds smoothly without a reversal or trade-off; the archive "breathes," scholars nod, and Elara accepts the next task, but no option is foreclosed and no cost paid. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (layered glyphs) and Causal (restoration quest), yet neither delivers a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story anchors who/where/when promptly. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric elements, but escalation remains flat—Mira encounters no meaningful resistance or tightening; the floodgate simply works as intended. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (water by conversation/encrypted compassion binding the city), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: no visible forfeiture, friction, or price paid by Mira or the council. The "clasp of the chain" gesture declares unity without dramatizing the stakes or consequences that led there.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece presents a continuous accumulative sequence in the attic, but the closure—Lila standing beneath the skylight after "the final flight"—lacks visible cost; the map "glows faintly" as testament, but no choice or renunciation forecloses a path on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending offers assertion ("balance and memory can coexist") rather than a charged image that reweights prior material. Causality is weak: the pigeons' flights and meteorite slivers produce a "soft, otherworldly chorus" without resistance or tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story opens with spatial disorientation (drifting terrace, field, maze) that is never anchored by ~120 words; who/where/when remain vague through the first third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward accumulative texture but offers no causal pressure or situational crystallization; the child drifts through discoveries without narrowing options. Closure reads as thematic summary ("the true distance… is the space between wonder and understanding") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The ending asserts triumph without demonstrating what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens without clear anchors—by line 120 we know "underwater city research facility" but not who Aria is beyond a title, why she's here, or what specific stake drives her beyond vague "hoping they would share their hidden cadence." The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost: Aria simply emerges "ready to map new destinies" in a declaration that summarizes intention rather than dramatizing closure. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead we get repetitive poetic phrasing ("luminous respite," "rhythm of belonging") that loops without tightening. No on-page cost forecloses a path or crystallizes options.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—bridge restoration via seed-placement—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "the disappearing paths were not lost, but merely awaiting the right emotional resonance" reads as exposition, not felt consequence. The causal linkage is mechanical (seed → color → bridge) without a meaningful tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge. The piece teaches an accumulative pattern early (seed collection, color translation) but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it simply completes the task.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is clear (who, where, when). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: beats layer atmospheric gestures without because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the performer's whispered promise and vanishing, but no on-page cost is legible—he completes the act, receives applause, and slips away intact. The final image reprises the bishop and violin echo, yet no visible forfeiture, realization, or stance shift occurs; the "echo" and "faint imprint" replace dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the piece withholds any conflict or complication; Lira's quest proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or meaningful narrowing of options. The "closure" is a declarative success—ink applied, verse complete, light spreads—with no felt cost, no path foreclosed, no before/after legible in her choices. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the piece lacks a closure unit: no Decisive Change (she was already a tide dancer performing her art), no Resonant Reconfiguration (no refusal or endurance that costs her something), no Conceptual Repricing (the verse's "success" is asserted, not dramatized as reweighting prior stakes). The ending summarizes aftermath ("word spread," "inviting them to choose") rather than landing cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, no decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration occurs on the page; Mira begins grateful and reflective, ends grateful and reflective, with no alteration in options or knowledge. The stone ritual and prism observations generate atmospheric description but no causal pressure or cost. Closure form is absent: the final image restates the opening premise without reweighting it. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural but lacks a cadence shift or density break that would constitute closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story presents a single uninterrupted walk from ridge to village with no causal linkage or tightening; each paragraph restates thematic claims without advancing options or knowledge. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but the "bargain" backstory and its mechanics remain vague and never constrain present action. The ending depicts light falling and the box becoming whole, yet no on-page decision, refusal, or realization creates a felt cost or alters Maren's state—villagers simply receive "the lesson" passively, and she walks away "forever lit," rendering the closure a thematic assertion rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Under any inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural is most plausible given the lyric density), the final image does not reweight prior material through a pressure point or cadence shift; it summarizes an outcome without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but causality remains decorative—balloons rise, the gauge flickers, equations "align," all without because/therefore linkage or motivated choice. The closure declares success ("the gauge was not a broken relic but a mirror") via exposition rather than on-page change; no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. Drive lens reads as intended-Causal but executes as vague Accumulative without a clear deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through recurring imagery (ivy, film negative, walls' dreams) and the closure reconfigures Lira's solitary burden into collective imagination—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost is largely told ("felt the legacy's burden lift") rather than shown through forfeited options or dramatized renunciation. The two-shard structure (initial discovery; months-later continuation) remains within one contiguous thematic window, but the second shard's time jump adds material without tightening prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.8)
    No causal chain or decisive change is legible; the painter completes his vision without friction, obstacle, or cost. The mirrors "begin to flicker" and then "shimmer" through unexplained agency, not protagonist choice. Orientation is absent: who, where, when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4 applied). The ending presents a cascade of doors but no before/after stakes shift or visible price paid, failing the closure requirement entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational lens: ritual negotiation under celestial witness. Orientation is delayed—who Lira is and what specific conflict she's resolving remain vague past the opening third. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (swords laid down, hymn sung), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible; the chieftains' capitulation feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality. One meaningful deepening occurs (weapons becoming symbols), sufficient for length, but the stakes never narrow options in a way that makes the resolution feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is unclear past 120 words: who this man is, why he stands here now, and what immediate decision faces him remain vague until well into the piece (−0.4). The closure unit—egg shattering and echo preserved—occurs on the page, but no visible cost alters the protagonist's options or stance; he simply "turned away," his world unchanged. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration, but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt pressure, landing instead as a static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words; waived. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural inferred; the piece teaches a lyric, image-dense pattern. Closure unit: the sanctuary unlocks and the "lullaby shattered" moment attempts Conceptual Repricing (the city's conformity replaced by individual voices), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with felt consequence. The courtesan's vanishing reads as convenient exit rather than earned renunciation with visible price. Escalation occurs (threads untangled → echoes freed → city hears), yet the protagonist's agency in this tightening is mechanical rather than motivated by prior causality or constrained by persistent limits.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure effect. Selene enters the dome seeking epiphanies, arranges dishes, watches the ember wane, leaves with a "promise" to reverse narratives in future puppet shows—but no decisive change, renunciation with felt cost, or conceptual repricing occurs within the text. The piece is purely setup and reflection; the stated ethical project remains a told intention rather than a dramatized stake that tightens or reweights. Orientation is established early (dome, night, calligrapher), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative density increase, nor situational crystallization produces a legible before/after on the page. The ending recaps the premise without closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who, where, and when are named early, so no penalty there. However, no on-page closure unit exists—Lira performs a ritual that never tightens options or imposes felt cost. The structures "would dissolve with the next sunrise" is told, not shown, and carries no dramatized trade-off. The "interrupted cadence" and "blushing stillness" recur as motifs but never constrain a choice or reconfigure stakes. Accumulative lens is suggested but the ending offers only thematic echo, not a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who Mara is, her current situation, and why she's in the sanctum remain vague past the opening third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit (traveler entering, rope singing a new name, library expanding) reads as conceptual repricing, but the cost is declared rather than dramatized: no visible foreclosure or felt price in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the ending gestures toward resonance without delivering on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (bunker, forest, storm approaching) land early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density and dream-image layering rather than because/therefore causality. However, closure lacks visible cost—the wafer seal remains intact, the directive rewrites itself, and she emerges "spirit dry" with new knowledge but no foreclosed path or felt price. The vortex's arrival and the directive's self-rewriting feel like convenient external solutions rather than consequences of her prior choices, undermining the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined" and "frugal astronomer" anchor genre but not concrete spatial position or immediate temporal frame until midway. The Accumulative lens appears intended (tile discovery → schematic work → ritual completion), but causality is thin—the tile's numbers "whisper" and the ritual simply succeeds without dramatized resistance or micro-turn. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant sealed, prosperity follows), yet cost is asserted in summary ("humility and precise accounting") rather than foregrounded in a specific forfeiture or image. The ending proliferates consequences (markets thrum, grain stores never empty) but does not crystallize a single charged moment where cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who Mara is, where precisely she kneels, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words, triggering −0.4. The dominant lens is unclear—events accumulate without causal linkage or a legible tightening (Kovan's touch → instant conversion, then the monks repeat the beat in summary). Closure is a summary statement ("carried its memory in every cell") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the wanderer's conversion duplicates the monks' beat without deepening. The story reads as outline rather than dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story provides who (Arlen), where (orchard), and what (capture the dream) within tolerance, so no orientation penalty applies. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (fog, sextant, mirror, frost) in a ritual cadence. However, the closure unit—the dream entering the mirror and Arlen's promise to guard it—lands without dramatized cost or a clear before/after in options or stance. The dream's "capture" is asserted by description ("the mirror's surface rippled, catching the dream's flicker"), not earned through a choice that narrows possibilities or a reversal that reweights prior material. No visible price is paid; the world simply grants success.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who Lira is and where exactly she stands remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative—layered images of orchard, ribbon, quartz—but the closure lacks felt cost: the lenses simply "click into place" and the world "sharpens" without forfeiture or reconfiguration. Under Accumulative expectations, the ending needed a density break or cadence shift that reweighted prior material; instead it delivers declarative satisfaction ("triumph," "hope," "renewed pact") that tells rather than charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece offers a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the cameo projects a constellation map, reweighting the "empty" object as a node network. However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague—"bewildered curator" and "astral orchard" are named but not grounded in actionable space or time within the first ~120 words. The causality is atmospheric rather than because/therefore; events feel like stations in a guided tour (orchard → bathroom → mosaic → cameo) without clear narrowing of options. Cost is asserted ("brightened disquiet") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed—who Selene is, where she stands, and what stakes she faces remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The "rescue mission" is told, not shown; no on-page moment forces a choice that narrows options. The ending offers no decisive change or felt cost: Selene simply steps through a portal to continue missions elsewhere, a setup for sequels rather than closure. Causality is stitched by convenience—vines accept a page, scrolls unfurl on cue—without dramatized resistance or price.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who this figure is, her concrete situation, and her agency remain vague past the first third. The piece accumulates lyric texture (mist, mirrors, ink) but lacks a clear drive lens: is this causal quest, accumulative pattern, or situational stance? The ending offers conceptual repricing ("true recapture was not of objects, but of stories") but the cost is asserted, not shown on the page—no tactical price, no foreclosed option. The "narrative threads" mechanism appears suddenly without prior setup or constraint, violating causality. Apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (seal, rope, door, fables of absence) toward a closure image where the door vanishes and the clock stops. Orientation anchors (mechanism room, vault descent, midnight trigger) land clearly. The closure effect—Charged Poise as the tower's mechanisms still and Mara records the episode—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (time frozen, absence harnessed), but the felt price to Mara herself is oblique; we cannot point to a sentence where her personal options narrow or a path forecloses. The causal linkage from seal to rope to door feels more symbolic checklist than because/therefore pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the timeline "after the energy beings arrive" provides adequate frame. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mapkeeper traces ice patterns, retrieves the stone, and deploys it to quiet the caves. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the mapkeeper commits to guard the "bloom of hush" and the caves settle into repose. Cost is implied—he returns to vigilance—but the final image does not unmistakably foreclose a path or reveal a felt price; the smile and whispered promise soften rather than charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who/where/when are established, but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—oscillating between causal (rekindle attempt), accumulative/textural (layered images), and situational (waiting for travelers) without a taught pattern. The closure unit is a summary report ("the beacon becomes a beacon of hope") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; no felt cost is visible. The caravan pivot in the final lines attempts to shift stakes but lands as exposition, not dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—storm, clouds, observatory, forecourt, crystal, obelisk appear as a floating catalog without spatial anchoring or a coherent "when" beyond "after rain." The piece declares a conjecture ("the way the stone sang mirrored the way societies retain shared pasts") but never dramatizes a test, reversal, or cost; measuring shadow lengths is mentioned, then abandoned without consequence. No on-page closure effect is legible: the archivist walks away "ready to sculpt new identities," a reiteration of the opening motivation with no visible change, forfeiture, or reweighted meaning. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) would require a density shift or pattern break at the ending; instead the final paragraph loops the same conceptual claim.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words—"wandering" offers no anchor, "blooming fortress" is metaphoric rather than spatial, and "dusk" into "hush of a night" blurs time without functional payoff at closure (−0.4). The piece drifts through lyric tableaux without causal linkage: the designer walks, chants, lifts the rag, watches sparks, then vows to return. No reversal narrows options; the "gravity of hopelessness" lifts without on-page cost. Closure reads as thematic echo rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she's there emerges slowly across the opening third. The "foretelling" of the clan meeting is set up but never dramatized; the two leaders appear suddenly in one sentence without prior spatial grounding or causal build. The closure substitutes atmospheric description ("water brightened," "stars watching") for a legible change in options or knowledge. No visible cost: she simply closes her notebook and leaves, pleased.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (~150 words before "bunker builder…thin‑skinned boy named Lio" clarifies who/where), warranting −0.4 per the test. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: silence-filaments sprout, intensify by flavor-type, then dissolve, leaving resonance in the doll. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the doll pulses with collected hush; corridors echo a new rhythm), but cost is implied rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path on the page. The final paragraph asserts thematic shift without showing a concrete price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (gondola operator, misty river, prism terrace) arrive early. The piece accumulates sensory images and repeats motifs (storm glass, whisper, silence) but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The ending ("the mission fulfilled") declares completion rather than demonstrating a before/after state with felt consequences. The sequence reads as transit-to-arrival rather than a meaningful tightening or deepening that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and motifs accumulate toward the throne claim. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mina simply places the flake, the throne "accepts her," and she smiles. No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the ending summarizes satisfaction rather than dramatizing a reconfiguration. Orientation anchors adequately early, but the because/therefore chain is weak; discoveries happen sequentially without motivated resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation remains deliberately obscured past 120 words with no functional payoff at closure (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive deepening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with on-page cost; the keeper steps through the threshold and "the lesson settle[s]" via summary assertion. No reversal narrows options; the sanctuary "responds" and "pulses" without the protagonist's agency forcing a trade-off. Closure lacks a legible cost unit—RR, DC, or CR—visible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and fragmented: who the narrator is, where exactly they stand in the farm, and what physical action they perform remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The "quantum promise" rule that concepts become physical is asserted but never tested or constrained—diamonds crystallize without dramatized resistance, and the glitchy texts resolve the central problem without prior cost or failure. No meaningful reversal narrows options; the bolt is placed, pressure rises, diamonds appear. Closure reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. The inferred lens (attempted Causal) collapses into summary-driven declaration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The orientation anchor (who, where, when) arrives early and holds. The closure unit—Lian reading the scroll and gaining insight—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and not felt: he encounters no sacrifice, foreclosed path, or trade-off. The gramophone guides him to the compartment through "standing waves," but this mechanism is asserted rather than dramatized; we see no narrowing of options or escalating difficulty. The piece reads under an Accumulative lens, but no pattern breaks or cadence shifts reweight the stake with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the knight is, where precisely he stands, and what concrete problem he faces remain vague past the opening third; "endless night" and "alchemical orchard greenhouse" supply atmosphere but not spatial or temporal anchors (−0.4 under Orientation Test, triggering Q3 cap at 7.0). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—vapor, script, moss accumulate into a tapestry—but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page; the knight's binding to the orchard is told in summary ("felt his armor melt into the moss") without a before/after choice or forfeited path. Causality is thin: the theater program's "forgotten patterns" enable the knight to "unsnap the cage of silence" and release the script, but how the patterns work or what resistance they overcome is never dramatized, only asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a legible closure unit with cost. Amelia presents the button to the supervisor, he agrees to display it, and she feels hope—no path is foreclosed, no felt price paid, no option reconfigured. The final morning repeats the opening pattern (dust rises, stories emerge) without tightening or deepening. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the ending merely restates the premise rather than reweighting it with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly, preventing a larger penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: who Mara is, where the lagoon sits in relation to the city, and when "plans unravel" occurs remain vague well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The causality is thin—Mara's possession of the key, discovery of the map, and arrival at the transmitter feel like narrative convenience rather than earned tactical choices. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the broadcast "revises histories"), but the conceptual cost is abstract and told rather than shown; no on-page consequence forces Mara to trade or forfeit anything legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (imagery and motifs layer toward thematic resonance), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it merely restates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive within tolerance. The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens—imagery and pattern rather than causal linkage—but the closure unit remains ambiguous: is the prophecy dissolved on the page, or only declared dissolved? The final image ("disappeared into legend, his whispered lullaby keeping the prophecy forever quiet") asserts closure rather than demonstrating it with visible cost. Cost Proof Test fails: no exact on-page sentence shows what was forfeited or what tactical option narrowed. Apply −0.6 for cost legibility and cap at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is accumulative/textural, but the piece never tightens or deepens; each beat (prod soil, find monument glow, discover pool, erect tower) adds detail without narrowing options or changing knowledge in a way that charges the ending. The orientation test passes narrowly (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the closure unit lacks visible cost—Lira places a leaf, dust rises, and a "pact" is sealed through metaphor, not a decisive change or renunciation that forecloses a path. No felt price or conceptual cost is legible on the page; the final image asserts harmony without friction. The because/therefore chain is weak: clues appear conveniently, and discoveries resolve without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately within the first third and maintains spatial coherence through the tunnel-greenhouse-cavern sequence. However, the closure is a thematic echo rather than a decisive change or renunciation with felt cost—Mara "finally felt a harmony" and offers the compass to city planners, but no prior option is foreclosed on the page and the stakes never narrow. The narrative operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but delivers conceptual statement ("trust uncertainty") instead of a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior pressure. The brazier inscription functions as overt theme delivery rather than image-based repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural; orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the coin's seam sealed, balance restored), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page—no tactical choice is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The kintsugi repair completes without complication, and the protagonist walks away with "quiet gratitude," a soft emotional reset that undercuts the promised weight. The because/therefore chain is weak: the gold flows because she whispers the dragon's name, but causality is mystical assertion rather than dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Mara is and what "lost soul collector" means arrives obliquely, and the gorge's geography remains vague throughout. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of grief → laughter), but the closure lacks visible cost: spirits transform off-stage, and Mara simply "understood her purpose" without forfeiting a path or altering her stance with felt consequence. The ending recounts aftermath ("travelers reported") rather than landing a decisive image on the page. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.9)
    The piece opens with disorienting abstraction ("impossible shades of violet," "anesthesia finally wore off") and does not anchor who, where, or when until well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. Drive lens is ambiguous: the forest walk reads accumulative/textural, but the whispered equation and strap removal suggest a decisive change that is never dramatized—no before/after options are legible on the page. The "ultraviolet penance" softening after the whispered equation lacks causal setup or felt cost; the resolution is asserted, not earned. Closure form is unclear: is this Conceptual Repricing or a vague shift? The final image (strap warming, turning golden) is symbolic recapitulation without a visible choice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains unclear past 120 words: who is speaking, where exactly they stand, and what concrete stakes exist stay vague. The drive lens is ambiguous—passages read lyric-accumulative but no pattern is taught, and no decisive change or reconfiguration with legible cost occurs on the page. The "translation loop" closing and the fragment dissolving are asserted metaphysically without dramatized causality or felt consequence. The ending offers thematic echo ("stories will never dim") but no visible before/after that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/investigative lens: Mara enters, notices cracks, follows clues (dust, sound, mirrors, clock), retrieves the ledger, and exits. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the burden transforms into purpose), but the felt cost is absent—she gains artifacts, ghost gratitude, and clarity without forfeiting an option or paying a visible price. The causal chain is smooth but lacks the tightening or trade-off required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Mara is and what "destabilize perfect systems" means remain abstract; the sea-of-clouds library is lyric décor, not a grounded locale). Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal "because" phrasing, yet no pattern is taught by the 25% mark. The ending offers a conceptual repricing (rupture reconfigures the library into portals), but cost is asserted ("reveal true wonder," "rewrite," "renegotiate") rather than shown through a forfeited option or felt price. Causality is intact but the closure unit lacks on-page weight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within tolerance. The closure unit—Lira's plan succeeds, the factions unite, visitors arrive, the asteroid hums with renewal—reads as summary rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page cost. The verse she recites, the storm's timing, and the mirrors' unveiling occur in rapid succession without causal linkage or visible trade-off; the reader cannot identify a moment where an option was foreclosed or a price paid. The drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative texture vs. causal turns), weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered images, rust-as-garden motif), but the closure lacks visible cost or reconfiguration—Alder simply succeeds, the village sleeps peacefully, and the final image (music box playing on its own) adds whimsy without reweighting prior material. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the resonance chamber sequence is purely procedural: chip placed, gear aligned, problem solved. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the covenant's threat dissolves without on-page friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but the inciting incident (packing the satchel, seeking the compass) dissolves into a travelogue descent with no clear because/therefore linkage. The psychometry "reading" appears twice but never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it simply narrates sensory impressions. The ending offers a conceptual repricing ("the place where explanations fail was...a state of quiet surrender"), but the cost is told rather than shown; Mara emerges unchanged, walking toward new storms with no visible forfeiture or reconfigured option. The piece reads accumulative in texture but lacks a single meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads accumulative/textural but wavers: the opening orients with mythic atmosphere, the middle threads together carving actions and lantern visions, yet no single moment reconfigures stakes with legible cost. The ending offers a retrospective summary ("reimagined not just a structure but an entire way of seeing") rather than an on-page decisive change or charged image that forecloses a path. Orientation is present early enough; causality is loose but not broken; closure lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story opens with reasonably clear anchors (amber pavilion, Mara, postcards) but causality collapses past midpoint. The postcards "unlock the cathedral's secret" through a vision mechanism—aligning one postcard with a sunburst motif triggers concealed lenses and a phosphorescent garden—that introduces no prior constraint and arrives as convenient magic. The closure asserts understanding ("the dawning hush was not silence but a promise") without dramatizing a choice, refusal, or reweighted option; the protagonist simply gathers postcards and steps back outside, unchanged in tactics or knowledge legibility. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the vision answers her question without cost, rendering the ending a thematic echo rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece reads as a linear quest checklist (summons → letters → diary → parley → descent → crystal → broadcast) without causal pressure or meaningful reversal. Orientation is delayed: by line ~120 words we know Mara's role and the zeppelin setting, but the obsidian lagoon premise and retrocognitive trap are introduced as told backstory rather than dramatized complications. The "retrocognitive trap" that "only released secrets when the reader remembered the future" is asserted but never constrains a choice on the page—Mara simply "realized" it, then proceeds. The closure—broadcasting testimonies that make dunes tremble—is a declared outcome with no visible cost or trade-off; we are told the weight lifted but see no price paid. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Causal (quest steps) but escalation is absent, and the ending reads more like thematic summary than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure: the ghost town "revival" occurs entirely through mental construction with no on-page cost, reversal, or foreclosed path. The amber bottle "opens" twice (first releasing a sigh, then "fully") without dramatic consequence or changed options. The ending loops through summary ("the cycle of revival began anew") rather than landing a decisive image. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and concrete situation remain hazy past the opening third; apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.6)
    Orientation is delayed: who Harel is (oath scribe/archivist) and his purpose emerge gradually through dense, ornamental phrasing rather than early anchoring (−0.4 per Orientation Test; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece accumulates atmospheric detail but the closure—recording the prophecy into vellum—does not reweight prior material or foreclose a live option with legible cost; the act is described as completion rather than transformation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern breaks or cadence shifts create closure pressure. No meaningful before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Mira is beyond "seed saver," why she was summoned, and what refusing the covenant would cost remain unclear. The piece declares a covenant and vortex inheritance but never dramatizes what reopening entails or what failure would look like. The climax (planting the seed) happens without opposition, so no options are foreclosed. No felt cost appears on the page; the atrium glows, the phoenix lifts off, and Mira smiles, suggesting symmetric satisfaction rather than Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—atmospheric density builds toward the bell's first note. Orientation anchors (sanctuary location, role, task) arrive early. The closure unit (the bell sings a new tone, visitors listen, protagonist feels confirmed) is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is abstract: the piece declares "noise yielded to understanding" without showing what option was foreclosed or what price the protagonist paid. The "switch" from old rope to new sensor proceeds without complication, so the final confirmation feels awarded rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: by line ~15 we know "janitor" and "station," but the spatial anchor (stone balcony) and the janitor's gender arrive past the 120-word mark without teaching disorientation as a pattern (−0.4). No causal turn occurs on the page; each sentence adds atmosphere but does not narrow options or change knowledge. The ending offers no Decisive Change, no Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, and no Conceptual Repricing—only continued vigil and metaphoric "dawn" without a before/after in stakes or stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with legible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks clear causality; events accumulate as lyric description without a dramatized change in options or knowledge. The ending shows the recluse placing the box on a pedestal and light fracturing—no decisive change, no visible cost that forecloses a path. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation (who, where, when) arrives late and remains abstract ("the world had turned to ash") without concrete anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents a loose Accumulative/Textural design, but no meaningful tightening or cost appears on the page. Mara's rediscovery journey proceeds by convenient discovery (ledger → phrase → hourglass → fragment fit) without resistance, error, or trade-off. The orientation test is met (~emerald silo, Mara, valley), but the closure image—villagers gathering, Mara narrating, sky stitched with silver sand—offers only a conceptual mood shift with no felt or visible cost. The final paragraph's "tapestry she could walk through, line by line, forever" is abstract assertion rather than a legible before/after with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.8)
    No causal chain links beats; the poet kneels, places a feather, writes verses, and the lagoon "responds" through passive constructions without dramatized resistance or turn. Orientation is delayed—we learn "he had spent years" and "legends said" mid-story, retroactively supplying context. The ending offers atmospheric description ("the lagoon glowed faintly") but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material; the final image simply restates the opening premise. Drive lens remains unclear: neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern with a meaningful break emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (council lifts the decree), but the reversal arrives via external fiat without Mara making a final choice or paying a visible cost. The six-month countdown never tightens tactics on the page; no beat shows her racing against time or sacrificing an option. Orientation is prompt (caretaker, orchard, six months), but causality is thin: copper-wrapped oaks "glow," council is "moved," decree lifted—each step asserted rather than earned. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (ritual observations, copper ritual), but the ending does not reweight prior material through cadence shift or pattern break; it simply declares success.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but the alien signal's arrival "just hours before" and the scholars' convergence remain vague in timeline and spatial staging. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Arin realizes homecoming is "not a place but a pattern") with a conceptual shift, but the cost is oblique—no visible forfeiture or tactic change on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: amber glow, rain, and tower vibration build density toward the final realization. Causality is loose: the tower's "alien echo returning" and the scholars' devices "recording the exchange" happen without clear because/therefore linkage to Arin's gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (orchids, seed pods, bird calls, phosphorescent algae) toward a lyric closure. Orientation anchors who and where early, though "after the reef died" remains vague in time. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (garden blooms, coachman smiles,jetty becomes "thin ribbon of hope"), but the cost is asserted rather than legible—nothing was at risk, no option foreclosed. The pattern accumulates density but the final image does not reweight prior material with visible pressure; the coachman's stance never crystallizes under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, meeting the test. The closure unit—Rook resealing the leaf and promising to carry voices—reads as Charged Poise, but the cost remains abstract and unfelt on the page; the phrase "translate distance into closeness" is repeated without reweighting. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, recurring motifs), yet the ending does not achieve a cadence shift or pattern break that reconfigures the dominant stake. No visible price forecloses a path; the leaf's return to wax reverses the discovery without dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague: "the city's hollow towers" and "the river of light" are metaphoric placeholders, not anchors (−0.4 in Q2). The drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation is suggested but no pattern is taught by midpoint, and the "glimpse" arrival is coincidental rather than causally earned or pressure-driven. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final sketch and alignment, but cost is absent: the protagonist simply records and whispers a promise with no path foreclosed or stance crystallized with felt price. The vision fades and the deck returns to status quo; no decisive change or conceptual repricing occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece orients who and where by the opening paragraph, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: is this Causal (the swaps break the curse), Accumulative (sensory layering reweights wonder), or Situational (the wrongness of the sky forces a stance)? The text gestures at all three without committing, and the ending dissolves into a summary montage (descent, village, market, next adventure) rather than a single on-page closure unit with visible cost. The curse's breaking is told in abstract terms ("warm light seeped," "images of forgotten constellations dancing") without a legible before/after choice or renunciation that forecloses a path. Causality is present but the closure effect is diffuse, failing the cost-proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (whispering gallery, interregnum, Mira) within the opening paragraph. A loose Accumulative lens is inferable—Mira walks patterns, discovers scroll, walks again, achieves peace—but the middle beats (clicking compartment, scroll reveal) rely on convenient discovery rather than motivated ellipsis or pressure-driven escalation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she finds peace and becomes the historian), yet no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page; the scroll simply vindicates her intent, and she smiles. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative and Situational without decisive commitment at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after extended description, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but causality is absent—Lira drifts, the stone "whispers," a corridor "unfurls," the book "offers" scent; no because/therefore linkage. The closure unit lacks visible cost: she "places the stone back" and steps out "ready to seed new stories," but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. Cost proof test fails; no sentence shows what she loses or gives up.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: recurring motifs (threads, labyrinth, chess metaphors) build toward a symbolic release. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but the "time-frozen village" conceit creates spatial vagueness—corridors and square remain abstract. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tutor releases guilt, the labyrinth dissolves), but cost is asserted ("dissolve into the tapestry's edge") rather than shown through a foreclosed path or trade-off. The piece teaches its pattern early yet the final "forgiveness" feels granted by setting rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece assembles an accumulative/textural lens with recurring image beats (pale spire, refracted echoes, bone towers), but causality remains opaque: Mara's actions (chalk sketches, mural, poetry sessions) do not narrow options or change knowledge in traceable steps. The "ritual" frame promises a tightening deadline but never constrains tactics on the page. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (collective forgiveness crystallized), yet the cost—"acceptance of loss"—is declared rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or choice that forecloses a live path. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words, waiving that penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who she is, where the workshop floats, and why she's pacing emerge slowly through decorative detail rather than early anchors (−0.4). The closure unit—placing the charm against the statue's fissure and narrating a story that "stitches" the world—reads as metaphorical wish fulfillment without on-page cost; the acid sea "calms" and voids "fill with liquid light," but no choice is foreclosed and no price paid. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, kintsugi motif), yet the ending delivers a tidy resolution rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt tension. Cost-proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where the alchemist loses, trades, or endures something concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (painter, quay, twilight) appear early. The cave discovery and hidden oasis function as spatial progression, but causality is weak: the painted seashell in the oasis matches the painter's palette by coincidence, and the key fits a chest the painter conveniently sealed years ago without prior setup. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the promise solidifies via the new canvas), but the cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift appears on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, held consistently, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers garden scent, vibration metaphor, and lighthouse imagery toward a final reconfiguration. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the cracked vial and "whispers truly travel farther than shouts" declaration, but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no visible price paid on the page. Orientation anchors (Mara, balcony, dawn, post-heat-wave) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The fisherman's approach offers a micro-turn but his agency, not Mara's choice, drives it; the ending recapitulates the premise without reweighting prior material through embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: objects and images accrue around the concept of "geography of loss." Orientation is delayed—who the navigator is, why she is at this station, and what specific loss she maps remain unclear past the 120-word mark; apply −0.4. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (ships appear, confirming the reverse migration), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no visible price paid by the navigator. The accumulation of moon phases, censer foot warmth, and ship lanterns charges the final image, but the protagonist's agency in the closure beat is observational only.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, what the orchard's social structure entails, and why this moment matters remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.4 penalty. The closure unit—Mara tending the glass eye as communal mirror—asserts a new social contract without on-page dramatization of acceptance, resistance, or cost from the community. The causal lens (inferred dominant) breaks when the smugglers' "greed eclipsed by sudden realization" replaces earned pressure with convenient capitulation. No before/after alteration is legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates lyric images (gaps in the tide, the flower, the lamp) toward a final reconfiguration where Marlowe "gives voice to a solitary gesture" and feels "truly seen." Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, twilight) arrive early. However, the closure effect—Marlowe's lighter heart and the promise "no one… will ever be lost to oblivion"—lacks demonstrable cost: no path is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no tactical price paid on the page. The cost remains asserted rather than felt or visible, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story presents a continuous scene anchored by "one midsummer night" and the blooming cavern, meeting the Orientation Test by ~120 words. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece offers density (map dealer, matrix chip, ants, doorway) and a cadence shift at the corridor threshold. However, the closure unit—Elian stepping through, seeing vistas, then returning—carries no dramatized cost on the page; the assertion "knowing that every future decision would now echo" is conceptual price without visible forfeiture or tactical change. The piece gestures toward Charged Poise but does not crystallize options with undeniable pressure at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when are not anchored by ~120 words; "disenchanted queen," "palace balcony," and "after the final warning" appear early but remain abstract without concrete grounding (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the queen ascends, finds a basin, drinks an orb, and the dreams dissolve—pure outline sequencing without pressure. Closure lacks visible cost: the orb "bursts," dreams "dissolved," and she returns "tempered by starlight" with no on-page forfeiture or tactical reweighting. The Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence makes the price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors appear late (~180 words) and remain vague: "ember nexus at twilight" functions as atmospheric label rather than concrete place. The piece operates in Accumulative mode but never tightens or deepens—each beat adds decoration (shell, palette, glow) without narrowing options or raising cost. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs; the group achieves their goal without reversal, and the ending asserts thematic uplift ("revalue the world") rather than landing a felt consequence. Closure validity fails under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who (lucid dream chronicler), where (mountain ranger cabin), and when (after seeing grave) are anchored, but the temporal frame remains vague—no concrete "today" or continuous action window emerges by ~120 words, and the reflective mode dominates without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but the final step outside does not reconfigure prior material with undeniable cost; it asserts resolve without foreclosing a path or altering options on the page. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the narrator moves from reflection to more reflection to an open gesture. Cap Q3 at 7.0 per Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece opens with clear spatial anchors (shop, bench, fog) and the dominant stake—unveiling ordinary miracles through repair—is signaled early. However, causality is weak: Lena whispers to the screw, aligns it with the pendulum, and the fog lifts without any on-page reversal or decision that narrows options. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding that "every repaired piece was a story of resilience") but the cost is conceptual and unmoored from prior pressure; no live choice is foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the accretion of images (fog, water level, ticking) does not tighten stakes or deepen conflict—it merely repeats the premise in varied metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor by the opening, but *when* remains vague (no temporal marker beyond "between storms"). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (crow quill, tea, scars, jasmine) without causal linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (scars transform into luminous runes), but no visible cost is legible—the transformation is asserted, not enacted through forfeiture or foreclosed option. The platform's descent is a spatial move, not a stake-altering consequence. Cost proof test fails: cannot point to a sentence where Lira pays a price or loses an option at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the exorcist gathers relics, arranges pages, and releases vapor to create a resonant apology. Orientation anchors who (the exorcist) and where (archive/orchard edge) by the first paragraph but "when" (the hush before trees are cut) remains atmospheric rather than a ticking pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—weight lifts, apology lingers—but cost is asserted ("I carry the weight of that ash") rather than forfeited on the page; we see no sacrifice or tactical shift that narrows options. The sheet titled 'Apology to Mara' appears conveneniently on cue without prior setup, weakening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The piece gestures toward accumulative/textural logic but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the protagonist walks, reads, places the dictionary, and vanishes without a legible before/after shift in options or knowledge. The ending offers spectacle (walls fall away, horizon converges) but no felt or conceptual cost; the "aching peace" is asserted, not dramatized. Closure form is unclear—neither Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, nor Conceptual Repricing lands with on-page evidence of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors emerge slowly across the opening third, though the pattern eventually coheres (−0.3 applied). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a decisive closure unit with on-page cost; the shepherd "understood" and "placed the mantle clock key back" without altering options or foreclosing a path. The ending dissolves into summary walk-away rather than a final image that reweights prior material. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows stakes; the count-to-zero moment is atmospheric but consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when arrive by ~120 words, so no penalty there. The dominant lens appears Causal (puzzle-solving), but the climax—writing a theorem—is told rather than shown, with no visible cost or options reweighted on the page. The subway discovery and traversal occur without resistance, reversal, or missed opportunities; each cryptic scrawl simply opens the next door. Closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; Mara emerges "understanding" that knowledge exists in two halves, but this realization is narrated rather than enacted and costs nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who Mara is and what she's doing remains abstract until Lena's call provides functional context past the 120-word mark; apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test, and cap Q3 at 7.0. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: voices layer onto the disc, building a chorus. However, the closure unit—Mara stepping out after hearing "Thank you"—lacks legible cost: what option does she foreclose, what does she lose by leaving the booth, or how does the tunnel's pulse reweight her prior isolation? The conceptual claim ("cultivated estrangement dissolved") is asserted rather than shown through a decisive image or action with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure unit: the archivist begins writing, continues writing, and promises to return—a static loop with no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or reconfigured stance. The "regenerated covenant" is asserted repeatedly but never tested or altered by events; no beat narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation is present (who/where/when anchored early), preventing the test penalty, but causality is absent: the locket, ledger, and lighthouse pact are described, not dramatized, and no because/therefore linkage drives the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors appear within the first 120 words (disused station, Lira). The piece follows a linear plan-execution arc: Lira hears rumor → summons caretaker → assembles crew → retrieves fragment → sends it onward. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows options; the ivy puzzle is solved in a single beat without complication. The ending delivers Conceptual Repricing (cure = catalyzing connections), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid. Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward thematic image), but density remains static throughout; the chime spreading is told, not shown reweighting prior material with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    Who, where, and when anchor adequately by ~120 words, avoiding the orientation penalty. The piece follows a single continuous thread—Lira walks, the melody guides, she touches bark, enters the stillpoint—but no causal because/therefore linkage tightens options; each beat unfolds by authorial decree. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "map of her soul finally complete," yet the stillpoint is told rather than shown with felt cost: we are informed "a nexus where all absorbed languages converged" without on-page pressure or sacrifice. The lens reads accumulative/textural (dense imagery, musical motifs), but the final moment lacks a cadence shift or visible price that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality is largely decorative: the pen "emits a faint phosphorescent trail" and suddenly "the hologram rippled, the wrong seeds sprouting tiny luminescent buds" without dramatized agency or cost. The closure effect—"editing history"—is asserted rather than enacted through a choice that forecloses options. The "gravitational anomaly" functions as atmospheric set-dressing rather than a constraint that narrows tactics. No meaningful tightening or cost is legible on the page; the narrator moves from problem to solution via metaphor rather than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silence-to-music gestures), but the piece never teaches a coherent progression or cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines; no penalty. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Lira's vow to "map silence again," but this is a summary promise rather than an on-page decisive change or felt cost—she simply walks away carrying an unearned emotional state. The story structure is mosaic (Arlen's night, then Lira's arrival months later), yet the two shards do not converge on a shared stake or tighten pressure; instead, the second shard duplicates the first without deepening or reweighting it. No meaningful escalation or narrowing of options occurs across the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.8)
    No identifiable closure unit: the piece summarizes a multi-year transformation without landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing on the page. The orientation anchor arrives late—who he is and where he stands remain vague past the 120-word mark—and the "three years off the grid" functions as a causality gap rather than motivated ellipsis. The drive lens is indeterminate; causal linkage is broken (the fire "guides his mind back" without mechanism), and accumulative design is announced but not executed through pressure or pattern. The final paragraph offers retrospective summary, not a reweighted present image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks an identifiable closure unit with on-page cost. Lira's drumming triggers metaphysical change in the garden and staff, but no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs—she continues drumming "night after night" in static legend mode. The drive lens is ambiguous: the text gestures toward accumulative/textural through repetition and auroral imagery, but pressure never tightens or reweights options; instead, it diffuses into cosmic harmony without friction or forfeiture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are delayed and impressionistic ("mossy platform," "observation dome") past the 120-word mark, and the lab/garden spatial relationship remains vague throughout. The ending summarizes aftermath ("became more than a story") rather than landing a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "port city" and "labyrinth maintenance worker" remain generic placeholders without grounding spatial choreography. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (storm imagery, map motifs), yet no pattern is taught by 25% and the closure—"whispered thought could outlast any roar"—summarizes theme rather than delivering a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final image ("labyrinth breathe with his rhythm") abstracts rather than reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a felt or conceptual price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by line two (guardian, cobalt dock, after rain). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (weaving patterns, shutters of water, spiraling outward). However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the guardian begins weaving and completes its task without reversal, complication, or cost. The closure image (dock glowing faintly, guardian turning away) asserts mission success but lacks on-page evidence of a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The final paragraph's "quiet triumph" is told, not earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (mist, lights, reflections accumulate toward a collective shift), but no single beat narrows Mara's options or forecloses a path with felt cost. The synchronized windows happen off-page; the mayor's forum and saplings appear without prior setup. Closure is a summary assertion—"The quiet has spoken"—rather than an on-page image that reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) drift across the library, town streets, vacant lots, and multiple weeks without clear transitions, violating the Orientation Test; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows an accumulative/textural lens but closure remains vague: the island "no longer vanished" and Mara feels "the island's heart beat within her own," yet what she has lost or forfeited is unclear. The Orientation Test is borderline—spatial anchors (dock, island, tower) arrive but temporal grounding ("the day after violence became impossible") is never dramatized or linked to present stakes. The scrimshaw unlocks the crystal, but the mechanics are metaphorical and the cost of release is gestural ("weight of centuries lift") rather than legible on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; events unfold in and-then sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: "after the happiness mandate" supplies a rule but no spatial or temporal anchor until the farmhouse is named. The story moves through a single static scene with no causal linkage—Mara whittles, narrates, places objects—but no because/therefore progression or meaningful tightening. The ending offers a thematic statement ("carving light from sorrow") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Under any lens, closure remains assertion without on-page pressure or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; the "ban" and "ancient chant" are never anchored to concrete cause or consequence, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure reads as atmospheric assertion: the poet crosses a threshold and the lake glows, but no before/after change in options or knowledge is legible on the page. Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost—only repetition of the same motifs (hush, hum, tremor) without escalation. Cost proof test fails: no sentence demonstrates a visible, felt, or conceptual price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern of "bartered awakenings" is asserted in every paragraph without a single causal tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first sentence, so no penalty there. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the glass-flower garden, but no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page; the courtyard simply "awakens fully" without resistance or trade-off. The piece teaches a lyric accumulation pattern early, but the ending does not reweight prior material—it extends the same declarative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but "after the power grid stabilizes" provides temporal setup without causal linkage—the grid never constrains a choice. The piece unfolds as a series of atmospheric demonstrations (strike chime → lamp refracts → mind responds) without a reversal, complication, or decision that narrows options. Closure offers thematic summary ("artificial pilgrimage continued") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The ending recycles the opening's declarations without reweighting prior material or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure unit—she becomes a "keeper of light" who guides others—lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The escalation follows a template: discovery → tracing → revival → teaching, with each step resolved immediately. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but causality is loose: the stencil "promises" rebirth without constraint, the rose blooms via traced intention without resistance, and the origami method appears fully formed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image repeats rather than reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. However, closure is largely asserted rather than enacted: "she had found her purpose" and "ready to chart the next unseen path" declare transformation without a decisive on-page change in options or knowledge. The textural/accumulative lens is implied but never tightens—each paragraph loops similar observations about mapping and mystery without a single beat that narrows her tactics or reveals new cost. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the piece ends where it began, wrapped in ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who (historian), where (archive), and the nature of the quest emerge slowly across the first third without clear spatial grounding. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase via layered images), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost. The ending offers only summary assertion ("his legend becoming one more atom of nostalgia") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible price. The pagoda "purifies" via light cascade, but no prior choice or constraint shaped this outcome; the result feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late and remain vague: "blooming library above clouds" and "after dreams become shareable" provide conceptual flavor but defer spatial and temporal grounding past 120 words (−0.4). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through patterned imagery, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the protagonist faces no narrowed options or raised cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the stone "now humming with the captured shadows"), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the footage brightens "as if remembering a promise" without on-page consequence or forfeited path. The lens remains legible, preventing a full collapse, but the closure unit lacks felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early enough, satisfying orientation. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: the opening suggests causal recovery from betrayal, but the middle becomes a ritualistic arrangement of objects (accumulative) without clear because/therefore linkage or density increase that reweights the stake. The closure—"balance is not a static point but a river"—offers thematic summary rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible. The tail-tip restoration happens without on-page consequence or tradeoff, and no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening but the causal chain is weak: the protagonist descends, the moss speaks, a root "asks" via the coffee rings, the protagonist aligns the hourglass, and the miracle "unfolds" without motivated linkage or visible cost at each turn. The closure image (frosted surface clears, light pours in, melody hums) offers atmospheric resonance but no legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, or Conceptual Repricing—what option was foreclosed or what price paid remains unclear on the page. The moss-root-hourglass sequence reads as a ritual checklist rather than because/therefore escalation. Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the final cadence does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the piece gestures at accumulative/textural (film frames, letters, humming tune) but lacks pattern-teaching or a decisive tightening that reweights stakes. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation serving closure. The ending offers no legible closure unit: the gazer "vanishes into the night, carrying the stored unused love like a lantern" is metaphor without on-page cost, decisive change, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material. Causality is opaque: psychometry "surges," letters "glow faintly," and the map appears without earned linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece lacks clear causality: the dreamer enters, traces stars, and "creativity is freed" without meaningful tightening or reversal. No on-page cost is legible—the instrument is "left behind" but this forfeiture carries no felt weight or consequence. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural (aurora imagery recurs, density of metaphor increases), yet the final image does not reweight prior material; it simply repeats the opening premise. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when remain vague until mid-passage), triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a post-apocalyptic frame and moves from discovery (dune blooms) through charm-speaking to renewal (light-trees rising). Orientation anchors who and where early; the temporal frame "after the last forest burns" is poetic but functional. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—the guard continues his mission with proof of success—but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page: no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The accumulative lens (density of imagery, cadence shift) is present but not taught by midpoint, leaving lens ambiguity. One meaningful deepening occurs (sparks take root), sufficient for length, but the ending feels more like confirmation than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed beyond 120 words with no clear who/where/when anchor until well into the piece; the opening offers "stray philosopher" and "mechanical rainforest" but no spatial or temporal grounding. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (hum, gear, forest imagery recur), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—the philosopher experiences no reversal, makes no decision that narrows options, and pays no visible cost. The ending smile and walk "onward" offer declaration ("probable miracles humming in his veins") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Cost-proof test fails: no sentence shows a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph and remain stable. The dominant stake—Mira seeking courage—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightens; the ferry journey and cave entry proceed without a reversal that narrows options. The chest opens via ticket-stamp mechanics rather than protagonist agency, and the ending "reclaimed courage" is asserted without visible cost or a credible before/after that forecloses a path. Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred but closure lacks the density increase or cadence shift required to reweight the stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bolt placement deepens the amber-to-copper discoloration and aligns the guests' internal rhythms, creating a pattern-break that reweights "unpardonable silence" without causal reversal. Orientation anchors arrive late—who the guests are, why they entered, and what nerve regeneration means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the guests accept silence's cost and carry the memory forward), but the cost is abstract: no on-page forfeiture of warmth, speech, or safety option is dramatized in the final image. The bolt's echo and the deepening hue charge the moment, yet the precise trade-off—what they surrender to stay—remains gestural.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed beyond 120 words—who the titan is, why he's been summoned, and what the oracle's role was remain vague until well into the piece. The drive lens reads as Causal, but key turns lack motivation: why does touching the crown trigger collapse, and how does the rune's flare unmask the pretender without the titan making a choice? The closure offers a Decisive Change (pretender fades, throne restored), but the cost is conceptual only—"treachery into dust"—without a visible price paid by the protagonist on the page. The ink pellet's mechanics (unveiling letters "not written by any hand") substitute mystery for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is present but drifts: who is speaking, what specific task is underway, and the spatial relationship between characters remain vague past the opening third. The closure—discovering the canyon coordinate—reads as information retrieval rather than a decisive change with felt cost; the "bridge between past navigation and future restoration" is declared, not dramatized. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending does not reweight prior pressure through image or cadence shift, only through exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation debt: who she is, where exactly she stands, and what immediate danger the rebellion poses remain vague past 120 words; the piece opens with atmospheric catalog rather than anchoring stakes. Drive lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural but wanders into quasi-causal language ("asked it to help," "whispered a vow") without teaching a clear pattern early. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the bay transforms, workers return), yet cost is asserted ("awkward confidence bloom") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or renunciation on the page. The hum and glyph linkage loops without a meaningful tightening; the engines restart but no live option narrows.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece attempts a causal arc—kite script unlocks amber—but the linkage is mechanical: each step succeeds without friction or cost until the final image. The closure unit (embryo's awakening and community gathering) reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted ("sacrifice of memory") rather than dramatized; no prior scene shows Anara valuing those lullabies or feeling their loss. The lens wobbles between causal (decode→unseal) and lyric accumulation (steam, moss, whispers) without committing; the ending leans lyric but lacks the density or pattern-break to land as Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when promptly (arboretum survivor, post-wedding bombing) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the pearl-of-stillness motif recurs, the photograph is handled twice, and the ending crystallizes her resolve through image and spoken vow. However, the closure unit—"I will remember... I will honor... I will let stillness guide"—articulates stance without visible cost; the choice to plant hope does not foreclose a live option or impose a felt price. The before/after remains more declarative than earned, capping the band despite structural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through cards, spiral, descent, and phoenixCard image, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elian steps back with "mind a mosaic of reclaimed pieces." The closure image ("luminous ache captured in oil and ink") signals acceptance but the felt cost is oblique—what exactly was forfeited or foreclosed remains textural rather than stakes-based. Orientation is clear (lighthouse library, Elian alone, present continuous). One meaningful deepening occurs (descent into chamber), though the causality reads more as lyric accumulation than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, where exactly the encampment sits, and what immediate danger looms remain vague past the 120-word gate, warranting the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The dominant lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation competes with a causal quest structure that never delivers a because/therefore turn—and no closure unit (DC/RR/CR) materializes on the page; Kael's "realization" is told in summary ("He realized…," "Kael understood…") rather than dramatized through a choice or renunciation with visible cost. The promise to "share the knowledge" after the eclipse is future-oriented and off-page, failing the on-page closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece attempts a Situational/Accumulative hybrid: Maren's letter ignites dormant networks, the council convenes, archivists awaken. Orientation (who, where, when) is established within the first ~100 words. The closure image—green shoots through marble, testament to brave scandal—reads as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (the council is scandalized, peace threatened). However, the cost remains abstract and off-page; we see no tactical sacrifice or foreclosed path for Maren herself after the letter is sent. One meaningful tightening occurs (letter ignites → networks wake → council convenes), but the escalation is narrated rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story orients adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words), but no causal pressure tightens options. Lira moves through a sequence of symbolic gestures—whispering to roses, placing sandbags, handing out petals—without a reversal, obstacle, or decision that narrows her path. The ending amplifies the opening tableau rather than reconfiguring it with visible cost; no Decisive Change, Earned Stasis with foreclosed path, or Conceptual Repricing is legible. Lens reads accumulative/textural, but density does not escalate and no cadence shift reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with sound-wave imagery building toward the final casting moment. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost occurs on the page—the fisher simply steps back into water with his line glinting, a static tableau. The closure lacks visible or conceptual price; the echo "settles" without altering options or foreclosing a path.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (sky/stair/observatory/journalist call arrive piecemeal without grounding who/where/when until deep into the opening); apply −0.4 in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The closure unit—console solves cipher, siren announces accountability, Mira descends—reads as Decisive Change, but the change arrives via deus ex machina (the console accepts the nib and auto-decrypts) rather than protagonist agency. The drive lens appears Causal on its face but linkage is weak: the nib's "lineage of ink" is asserted, not earned through prior dramatization, and the ledger's discovery does not narrow options or foreclose a path with on-page cost. Capping at mid-5s for orientation debt and weak causal cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality is declarative rather than dramatized: "She discovered the key hidden in handwritten letters" is told in summary, not shown through search or struggle. The amber-insect mechanism that translates cries appears fully functional without prior testing or failure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the laboratory breathing and the city singing a lullaby, but no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page—guilt simply "loosens" and is kept "at bay" without sacrifice. The drive lens reads as intended Accumulative/Textural but the final densification lacks a felt price, reducing closure to thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern should build toward a cadence shift or reweighted image. However, no meaningful tightening occurs; each beat (lifting the tile, drawing the mandala, the violinist's arrival) restates the same atmospheric effect without narrowing options or altering knowledge. The ending recycles "lilac unease" and "emergent hush" without visible cost or a reconfigured stake, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure effect remains abstract. The protagonist kneels, whispers "Hearthsteel," and light cascades—but no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page. The final paragraph's "retrocognitively trapped past dissolve" is told rather than shown through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the causal chain from kneeling to light-release to city transformation lacks dramatized intermediary steps that would make the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words, establishing the ghost and theater backdrop. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: events layer sensory detail and symbolic recursion rather than causal linkage. However, closure fails the cost test—the ghost's "peace" and the shopkeeper's miracle are asserted without visible forfeiture or friction; the tarot coin's mechanics ("align scattered seconds") are declared but never shown constraining a choice. The fractured timeline never tightens options on the page; it remains ornamental. The Drive Lens Rule holds but closure lands without felt cost, capping the category mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality operates as a straight line of successful technical steps with no reversal, tightening, or cost. The "breakthrough" is handed to Mara by an external event (the power surge), and every subsequent action succeeds without friction or failure. No closure unit is legible: the ending summarizes future intent ("prepared to devise the next experiment") rather than landing a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The piece reads as an outline of discovery rather than a dramatized pressure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear by ~120 words, so no penalty there. However, no on-page closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—lands with visible cost. The final image ("the elk leaf fossil drifted...") offers atmospheric satisfaction but does not reweight prior material or crystallize a before/after with felt price. Linkage is associative rather than causal or accumulative with legible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece signals a quest to unscramble a prophecy but delivers no meaningful on-page tightening or deepening under any coherent lens. Mara catalogs buttons, places one by the jar, the echo vibrates, verses clarify—each step proceeds without reversal, narrowed options, or felt cost. The ending declares success ("the prophecy, once a tangled mess, now lay plain") without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the world begins to "rewrite its own story" off-page. No visible price is paid, and the accumulative texture does not shift cadence or reweight stakes at closure. Orientation is present early, but causality is convenience-driven: the echo recognizes buttons, sand "forms a thin bridge," and all obstacles dissolve on contact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—concrete who/where/when remain vague until the valley descent. The drive lens oscillates between accumulative-lyric (codes in snow, silver hush motifs) and causal (pillbox unlocking, map projection) without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the final "unused courage" revelation is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; the pillbox releases "light that rose like a phoenix" in lieu of an on-page choice or forfeiture. The valley sequence introduces new rules (glowing codes, crystal spring) that resolve problems they did not create.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the opening lines. The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, needle, ticking, and reflection layer toward a quiet resonance. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Arlen waits, listens, the fog lifts, he leaves. The "promise" mentioned early is never tested or paid in visible cost; the closure image (smooth river, finished stitch) asserts resolution without dramatized consequence. Cost remains conceptual and unevidenced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (lantern, thrum, sun patterns, fractured timelines) build toward a final image where the oasis "breathes again." However, the closure lacks visible cost—the hives awaken, the lantern glows steadily, and Mara walks away satisfied. No path is foreclosed, no trade-off made legible. The ending reweights prior material through recurrence but does not impose the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: luminous vines unfurl, spreading light into alleys, and the "quivering hush" settles into "steady breath." Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the harbor accepts her offering; darkness recoils; vines still glow at dawn), but the cost remains implied rather than undeniable on the page—Mara whispers a promise to return, yet no visible price (time, stamina, social credit, forfeited alternative) is dramatized. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs (vines catch moonlight and spread), satisfying length expectations, but the absence of legible cost at closure prevents entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.8)
    No identifiable closure unit: the ending offers atmosphere and declarative summary ("her independence forged from isolation") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing. The piece drifts through a series of actions (placing the sundial, climbing, placing it again) without a meaningful narrowing of options or a felt price—Mira begins alone and ends alone, declaring victory without on-page transformation. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Mira is, what the library's agency means) and never clarified. The lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern payoff, nor situational crystallization is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates prismatic imagery but the closure unit is unclear—Mira's final "rejoin" is asserted ("she had rejoined") rather than dramatized with a decisive act or visible cost. The spiral's mechanics (how letters "find homes," how the thread "unlocks") remain abstract; no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. Orientation is present early (who/where/when by paragraph one), but causality from whispered letter → mosaic transformation → constellation → rejoin reads as declarative sequence without motivated ellipsis or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece strings together declarative moves without because/therefore linkage: Mara sets up a transmitter, the tricksters inject a false alarm, the subsonic pattern deflects it—each beat announced rather than dramatized with narrowing options. Orientation remains vague (we never learn campus layout, console mechanics, or time elapsed), violating the ~120-word anchor test; applying −0.4 here and capping Q3 at 7.0. No legible closure unit: the final paragraph summarizes outcomes and spreads to kitchens and firehouses rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation debt: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words—"the explorer" is a role, not a name; "shadowed nexus" lacks concrete anchors until the organ appears. Lens ambiguity persists: causal gestures (compass triggers passage) compete with accumulative mood-building without teaching a pattern. Closure disperses across multiple micro-resolutions (key retrieved, door opened, garden revealed, vow made) rather than landing in one decisive image with legible cost; the "mutiny of space" remains metaphorical decoration. The Cost proof test fails: no exact line shows what the protagonist forfeited or risked at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a coherent drive lens; it drifts between accumulative (stone responding, mist swirling), causal (cold case resurfacing), and lyric registers without teaching a pattern. No meaningful closure unit is legible: Mara "steps back" having "sensed" success, but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The quarry "crack" and "tear" are figurative assertions, not dramatized turns. Orientation is delayed—"after the evidence disappears" situates time vaguely, and the cold-case premise is told rather than pressuring present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are nominally anchored early, but the premise sprawls across multiple concepts (weather station, ancestor's nail, mariner's journals, reversible exile) without teaching a coherent pattern by the 25% mark, creating persistent cognitive fog. The inferred lens is ambiguous—neither clear causal linkage nor accumulative pattern emerges—and the ending offers no decisive change or reweighted cost; Mara retrieves the nail and embeds it, but no before/after stakes shift or foreclosed path is legible. The vortex arrives and passes without altering Mara's options or knowledge, functioning as scenery rather than closure pressure. No cost proof sentence exists at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/lyric pattern early (bridge-song, wet-plate imagery, mountain ritual), but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the fiddler completes his task and the hitchhiker "appears, pixel by pixel" without any foreclosed path or felt price paid. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. Causality within the ritual sequence is linear but ornamental—each step (trek, play, expose glass) advances through declarative progression rather than because/therefore linkage that narrows options. The ending offers conceptual reconfiguration (amnesty granted, hope captured) but the cost remains abstract assertion ("the weight of the moment settle like ash") rather than a legible on-page forfeit or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece moves from startup ambition → physical markers → crash → dawn resolve in a plausible Accumulative/Textural arc. Orientation anchors are present but slow: "son of a feared highway robber" and "LoopForge" arrive early, yet *when* and *where* the startup sits remains hazy until "office, a converted warehouse." The closure—Arlen pocketing the last bill and walking toward the co-working space—signals a stance shift but lacks visible or felt cost: no dramatized renunciation or consequence that forecloses the old loop. The final paragraph asserts "measured hope" rather than *showing* what he surrenders to step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately but proceeds via "and then" sequencing: telegram arrives, dome opens, she aligns telescope, inscription appears, temple opens. No because/therefore linkage tightens options; each step grants Mara exactly what she needs without friction. The ending offers no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with felt cost—burdens are "shared" and doors open without on-page trade-off. Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) waived as anchors appear early, but causality remains decorative rather than motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late and remain vague: the "cursed lake" and "swirling orchard vortex" are named but never grounded in concrete spatial or temporal cues within the first ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece gestures toward a causal arc (druid seeks confession, releases it, seals it in seed) but the confession itself never alters her options or knowledge—it simply "shatters," she "gathers," she "whispers," with no visible cost or trade-off. The closure unit is a soft reset (lake clears, trees bow) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: accumulative imagery (expanding circles, shards) is present, but no pattern is taught early or paid off with a cadence shift or reweighting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the visionary is, where exactly she stands, and what timeline constraint applies remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The "eclipsed covenant" is declared but never dramatized as a live choice or obstacle; she reaches for the clipping and immediately receives the beacon with no reversal or cost. The ending claims transformation ("the world outside would soon awaken") but offers no on-page change in her options or knowledge—she steps back through the portal with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. No coherent drive lens emerges: the piece oscillates between causal promises (maze responds, portal opens) and accumulative texture (spirals, scars, filaments) without teaching a pattern or landing a decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening lines (Maelia, catacomb orchard, half-lit corridors). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered imagery and the ash-to-amber transformation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of Maelia carrying the amber thread reweights the opening void—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the root shivered and luminescence rose, yet the overall arc feels iterative rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague—who, where, when emerge slowly through dense lyric texture without a taught pattern by ~25%. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (moving toward purpose), but the cost is conceptual assertion ("letting the echo...mingle") rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that narrows options on the page. The dominant lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and a failed Causal arc; no single meaningful tightening or deepening that changes knowledge or tactics is legible. The ending recounts internal shift without dramatizing the price.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative, with orientation anchored adequately by ~120 words (translator, magnetic arbor, post-spirit departure). However, closure lacks decisive cost: the seed sprouts, harmony is reestablished, and Lira decides to test it elsewhere—all outcomes are additive without visible forfeiture. The final paragraph's journey-plan functions as sequel rather than a reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible with felt price. Causality remains loose (seed shimmers because she whispers verses, arbor responds because it "senses" the shift) without earned mechanical linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early (fluctuating volumes, tidal rhythm, moon phases) and maintains tonal coherence through the ending. "After tomorrow disappeared" introduces a temporal rupture but never tightens options or forces a trade-off on the page; the librarian's response (smelt a key, open blank volumes) proceeds without obstacle or cost. The closure image—creel glowing, visitors feeling a subtle shift—offers Conceptual Repricing of routine-as-marvel, yet the price remains asserted rather than dramatized. Orientation is swift (tidal atrium, titan-gear librarian, moon-phase volumes), preventing deeper penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs (key touches creel, stories unfurl), but the stakes never narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual beats (descend, kneel, read, lift, place, vow) without a causal turn or meaningful deepening. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Mara is, why she was "summoned," what "dissolve the walls between hearts" means concretely) and never anchors in stakes or choice. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the pearl as "shared lantern"), but cost is asserted rather than felt—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The ritual unfolds inevitably, with no agency or sacrifice legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who (river chronicler), where (disused station), and when (after stopping medication) within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the protagonist arrives, finds graffiti wisdom, follows tunnel markers, plays accordion by the river, and leaves with renewed resolve. One meaningful deepening occurs when the river "reflects my image, younger" and the narrator draws a fresh map, reweighting prior material. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final walk toward horizon with accordion humming and ivy parting crystallizes resolve with felt cost (the "fragile stone I finally dared to keep"). Cost is legible but oblique—the piece implies ongoing pilgrimage rather than a decisive change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words with no payoff—"glowing library in mist" remains a floating placeholder, and spatial anchors never cohere (shelves, alcove, chamber, labyrinth, garden cascade without legible transitions). The drive lens is ambiguous: causal linkage is weak (gears "cyclically reversed" without clear mechanical consequence), accumulative patterning is attempted but never teaches its rule, and situational pressure never crystallizes a stance. Closure is asserted—"we had finally found the secret we chased"—but no on-page cost is legible; the discovery arrives without foreclosing an option or altering tactics. The "living script" and "propagation delays" are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation test fails: by ~120 words we have "velvet observatory," "amber lamps," and "Elara" but no temporal or spatial grounding beyond "midsummer" abstraction. The closure unit presents a decisive change (floating city rises autonomously), but the causal chain is broken: the envoy lowers his sword because "his eyes filled with the same mulberry ache," a motivational leap with no prior setup. The "because/therefore" linkage collapses when the empire "humbled, agreed to share"—coincidental resolution that undercuts earned causality. Cost is asserted ("heart heavy") but not legible in lost options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (skyborne grotto, aurora, beautician mortician's task). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the emerald chip gathers meaning through ritual actions, and the aurora's acknowledgment constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. However, cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—"knowing that within its green heart now beat the last spark" tells the weight without showing what she forfeited or risked. The closure image (chip placed, aurora's brief reignition) reweights the opening stake, but the effect is decorative rather than charged by on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and holds a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through recurring images (hairpin, grotto, vines) and a cadence shift at the sunrise ritual. However, the closure unit—Mara's realization that "contentment was not a hidden treasure but a return to the simple rhythm of caring"—is asserted rather than reweighted by prior pressure; the felt cost is missing, replaced by summary declarations. The hairpin's sunrise alignment reads as symbolic payoff without narrowing options or forfeiting a live alternative. Under the chosen lens, the final image should recharge prior material with undeniable pressure; instead, it restates the premise without on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, why she's been summoned, and what the decree entails emerge slowly through layered metaphor rather than concrete anchoring by ~120 words (−0.4). The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens—wind chimes, mirror shard, cloak of doubt accumulate meaning—but no decisive tightening occurs; the "unhooking" is performed without resistance, and the magistrate's shift from certainty to nuance is told via metaphor ("eyes...now wavered") rather than enacted choice. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the cloak settles, nuance invited), yet the cost is conceptual and abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift makes the price legible in a specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with aspirations toward Conceptual Repricing. The story moves through meditation platform → pond ripples → grotto descent in a single continuous sequence, meeting scope defaults. Closure attempts a CR (the grotto lesson reweights her quest) but the conceptual cost remains opaque: what exactly does Mira forfeit or risk by learning this? The final image—stepping back onto the platform to teach others—feels like consequence-free resolution rather than a reconfiguration with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean; causality is loose (ripples "guide her steps" without clear mechanics).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—no clear spatial anchor or present-tense action emerges until well into the piece, warranting −0.4. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the protagonist simply declares mastery in summary ("she held the means") without a before/after shift legible in action or image. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence at closure shows a felt or visible price paid. Causality is intact but the closure unit is missing, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece opens with anchor (who/where) within tolerance. A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted—Selric's acceptance of his quiet magic—but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page; no specific option is foreclosed, no tactical shift forced. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered symbolic images building to a thematic payoff), but the keystone's "pulse" and the mist's "coalescence" feel convenient rather than motivated by prior beats. The ending offers thematic declaration ("the sacred was not a distant relic") without a decisive image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece presents a quest structure (pier → hull → library → discovery) but lacks causal linkage; each step unfolds because the plot requires it, not because prior choices narrow options. The "hide behind truth" instruction is opaque and never clarified on the page, leaving the reader to infer meaning without dramatized friction. Closure arrives as satisfaction rather than decisive change or cost: Eli finds what he sought and simply vows to continue, with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The Orientation Test is waived (pier, night, lamplighter anchored early), but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—neither causal pressure nor accumulative density coheres at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~40 words, satisfying the test. The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Silas achieves "alignment," but the final beat lacks visible or felt cost—no option is foreclosed, no tactical shift is dramatized, and the prophecy's fulfillment is told rather than shown through a causal turn. The closure unit reads as abstract affirmation rather than an on-page reweighting with legible price. Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the ending does not produce a decisive cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors appear early (observatory, reaper, recordings found). The piece follows accumulative/textural mode: crystals accumulate, each named, then dissolve into aurora. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira remembers her sailor's name and feels release—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; nothing is foreclosed on the page. The "echo of sacrifice" transforms from burden to bridge via assertion, not dramatized choice. One meaningful deepening occurs (recognition of the constellation spelling her love's name), but the final beat lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors appear by the second paragraph (mage, viaduct, post-last-fish timeframe). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dripping mist accumulates into a pattern that heals the bell. However, closure lacks visible cost—the bell simply mends, fish return, stars shift, all consequences are positive and unopposed. The "brittle devotion" is declared fragile but never shatters or demands sacrifice on the page, so the Resonant Reconfiguration does not register a before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored within bounds, no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but remains ambiguous—photographs accumulate yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with visible cost. Closure unit is unclear: Caitlyn places the label beside the chime and reads a story, but no decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost occurs on the page. The townspeople's "weight of truth lift" is asserted, not dramatized. Cost proof test fails: cannot point to an exact sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat. Apply −0.6 in Q2 for missing cost and lens drift, plus Non-closure Accumulation Cap −0.8 for causality thinness across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.8)
    No legible closure unit. The ritual succeeds without reversal, and the final beat—shard placed in oak, pulse radiates—delivers only declared success without a felt or conceptual cost that forecloses a path. The piece reads as linear accumulation (crystal → flame → starlings → explosion → spiral → oak) but the ending offers fulfillment rather than a decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing. Orientation is present early, but the drive lens remains ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative/Textural yet the ending does not reweight prior material through cadence shift or pattern break; it simply completes the checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation arrives slowly—"nocturnal arbor above the clouds" and "midnight pattern seeker" delay who/where/when past the 120-word threshold, though the radio crackle eventually anchors the inciting pressure. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: the seeker climbs, revises the harness, descends, and receives affirmation, with closure landing as Charged Poise when the crew emerges and the seeker turns back toward the clouds. The final image reweights the watcher's burden through the cycle's return, but the cost remains conceptual—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The radio's "Hold fast" and the crew's relief gesture toward stakes, yet the dominant pressure (preserve trust) never narrows tactics or forces a trade-off during the revision itself.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, where the dojo floats, and what "history rewrites itself" means remain vague past the opening third, forcing the reader to infer stakes from abstract labels. The closure—Kael slicing the jar and feeling a "pulse"—lacks visible cost; the Guardians and Syndicate instantly dissolve their conflict without dramatized consequence. Causality is weak: the "blade of paradox" concept enables the slice without prior setup of what this means or why it works, and the Duplicate awakens via summary rather than on-page struggle. The drive lens is ambiguous (attempted Causal with Accumulative dressing), and the ending offers reconfiguration without felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, though the symbolic density makes concrete spatial grounding unclear (−0.3). The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but no meaningful tightening or cost occurs—the conductor performs, ghosts reassemble, joy returns, all without friction or trade-off. The ending declares "restored joy" and "satisfied" eagerness without demonstrating what was risked or lost on the page. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost is present.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit—opening a "new wing" and welcoming travelers—lands as summary rather than a decisive image with visible cost. The garden setting and pendant are established early, but the causal chain dissolves into abstract philosophizing ("boundaries of light," "veil of sleep") without a legible tightening or deepening that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed: "she—if the term could fit" and "it spent" create pronoun ambiguity, and the spatial relationship between garden, library, and "new wing" remains vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who this person is, where the nexus sits in space, and what "twilight" means as duration remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual repetition, density increase via tincture variations), but escalation is weak—each elixir application succeeds without complication, and the final "eruption" lacks a legible cost or choice that forecloses a prior path. Closure occurs on the page (the crozier vivifies, the realm responds), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no visible sacrifice, failed attempt, or relational price anchors the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes spatial anchors (tower, gorge, antenna) within the opening paragraph, satisfying basic orientation. However, the closure unit—villagers emerging and thanking Selin—arrives without prior dramatization of their existence or stake in the tower's signal, creating a convenience resolution that undermines causal integrity. The "beginning in every ending" motif is declared repeatedly but never tested or deepened through a meaningful reversal; Selin's success unfolds as a series of affirmations rather than a tightening choice that forecloses options. Cost is conceptually implied but not legibly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building via sound and image), but the closure lacks visible cost—sand rises, passengers materialize, the ferry never vanishes again, all without a felt price. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive immediately, waiving that penalty, but the causal chain is weak: Lio broadcasts a tone and the ferry reappears because the story declares it so, not because prior causality earns it. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options; the resolution feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure unit is present: the protagonist walks in, performs actions without opposition, and walks out unchanged. The Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4): "who" is labeled but not anchored in concrete perception, "where" is abstracted into metaphor soup, and "when" never materializes. The piece lacks a dominant stake—no decision narrows options, no reversal alters knowledge, and the ending offers thematic assertion ("the world can be reshaped") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. Drive lens is indeterminate; accumulative design is claimed but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the material.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    No closure event occurs on the page; the test vessel's success is narrated in summary, the celebration happens off-stage, and Mira's final gesture (placing the chain link back) is purely symbolic ritual without stakes or cost. The piece reads as a world-building summary spanning many nights and curriculum changes rather than a single scene with a meaningful tightening. Causality is loose—edge geometry and the alien lattice enable navigation but through explanation rather than dramatized problem-solving. Orientation is provided but the narrative remains in expository mode throughout, never coalescing into a present-tense dramatic unit.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the reader learns "atrium" and "contact tracer for hearts" but lacks concrete anchoring of who this person is, where exactly they stand, or what immediate stake drives them until deep into the piece. The closure unit—a promise whispered through the hearing aid—lands without visible cost; the protagonist suffers no loss, makes no renunciation, and the final image restores the photograph's colors in a feel-good flourish that undercuts pressure. Causality is weak: the hearing aid "hums," the narrator follows pulses through vaulted corridors, discovers a photograph, hears a voice, finds an alcove, and the light "spills over" to restore colors—each step is convenient escalation without friction or tradeoff. Under any inferred lens (most likely Accumulative/Textural given the lyric diction), the piece needed one meaningful tightening that narrows options or imposes felt cost; instead it offers atmospheric drift and a sentimental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the opening window, but causality is weak: Mara arrives, aligns the codex, activates phase transition, and emerges in a new chamber through steps that feel like checklist execution rather than because/therefore linkage. The "return protocol" at the end lands as a label without prior setup of what it costs or forecloses. A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted in the final image (burying the codex, heart at ease), but the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated—no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the before/after legible. Lens reads as attempted Causal but drifts toward summary at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is diffuse: who/where/when anchors arrive late and are buried in metaphor ("opal observatory," "legal phantom," "quantum server") without spatial grounding by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—Mara realizing the ghost is a mirror and stepping onto the roof with new wisdom—lands as conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("a broken piece can still hold meaning") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres around a single pressure; beats feel like ornamental description rather than because/therefore linkage or cadence shift that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers sensory density (echo tunnel, birds, diamond) toward a final ritual moment. Orientation anchors ("copper-veined storyteller," "mouth of a tunnel," "towers of bone") appear early. However, closure lacks visible cost: the ritual succeeds, the language is "locked" in the tunnel, and the storyteller departs satisfied—no option is foreclosed, no price legible beyond a vague claim that "the language of texture would be locked forever." The ending reconfigures nothing; it summarizes triumph without on-page friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: "the herbalist's underground garden" offers no spatial grounding, and "after the missing return changed years ago" provides no actionable timeframe (−0.4 for orientation debt). The closure unit—arrowhead shattering, moss turning silver, bitterness "loosening"—lands as a sequence of effects without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path; the protagonist observes a transformation rather than enacting one. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the pattern never coheres: the phone's "static-laden confessions," the arrowhead's hum, and the moss's glow remain discrete ornaments rather than a tightening motif. No meaningful deepening or cadence shift reweights the stake; the ending declares redemption ("frostbitten hope that turned the dark into a joke") without demonstrating the price paid or options lost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural by default (layered imagery, recursive phrasing), but no meaningful pressure tightens or deepens; instead, every beat expands the same painterly tableau. The closure—the violinist stepping down and vowing to plant seeds—arrives as summary declaration with no visible or felt cost: he already succeeded without sacrifice, and the shell is left as a "beacon" in a purely symbolic gesture. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (sky-bridge, orchard, mechanical regime), so no penalty applies there, but the lack of a legible cost or reconfiguration at closure keeps this in the low-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "disputed territory mailman" and "smuggling drone border" land without spatial anchors (who controls what, where the line runs) until the arcade interior emerges mid-paragraph, costing ~−0.4. The drive lens oscillates between Accumulative (storm-as-motif, neon texture) and Causal (storm blinds drone, envelope delivered) without a taught pattern, forcing Hybrid inference but the ending dissolves into abstract claim ("broken promises could heal") rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing in intent—the storm "sealed" becomes "calm sky," voids honored—but the cost is asserted ("dust of old grudges" washed away) not legibly paid on the page; no option is foreclosed, no tactic visibly altered by what Milo surrenders. The two-drone salute and rival nod gesture toward a change, but the rival's arrival is coincidental (not forced by Milo's prior choice) and the peace remains offstage promise rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains unclear past 120 words—who Mara is, why she's on this train, and what she wants are buried in decorative abstraction. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but never teaches a coherent pattern; events unfold as "and then" magic without motivated ellipsis or causal linkage. No closure unit is legible: the ending offers a vague promise of eternal music with no decisive change, no visible cost, and no reconfiguration of prior stakes. The "wrong turn leads to hidden oasis" appears retrospectively without shaping any on-page tactic or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds toward the star-chronicle projection and Mara's return to the desk. Orientation anchors (midnight library, Mara, patrons) arrive early. However, no reversal or tightening narrows options—the reawakening proceeds without obstacle, and the ledger-logging closure offers no visible cost or reconfigured stance, only a promise of future repetition. The Möbius-strip metaphor and hyperbolic-field mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, weakening causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation Test: who (Mara), where (lighthouse library/archipelago), and when (sunrise ritual) arrive within the first 120 words, but the spatial and temporal frame remains vague throughout—no clear before/after or stakes test. The ending offers a thematic statement ("longing, when shared, becomes a light") but no decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration; Mara's actions do not foreclose a path or alter her stance. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the stake with legible cost. Closure is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words ("shadowed nexus," "cosmic possibility"); the nexus functions as nowhere, triggering −0.4. Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—so the piece drifts between modes without committing, warranting an additional −0.3. Closure relies on a Conceptual Repricing (the filament as bridge between fear and courage), but cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page sentence demonstrates what the locksmith sacrifices or what path is now foreclosed. The ending describes travelers arriving later and learning a legend, diluting the protagonist's closure moment into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchors arrive within range. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of constellation-mapping → mushroom-arranging → memory-return), but the closure lacks felt cost—the water recedes, saplings appear, songs return, all without on-page sacrifice or foreclosed option. The final paragraph summarizes decades of legacy rather than landing a decisive image with pressure. Because the ending delivers complete restoration with no visible price paid in the moment, the RR does not meet the cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.8)
    The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—accumulative lyricism competes with pseudo-causal tea-leaf decoding without committing to either. The "reversible exile" closure hinges on tea-leaf geometry unlocking a solar alignment, but this mechanism is introduced and resolved in the same continuous narration with no prior constraint or cost; the shadow dissolves, walls seal, and the library sighs relief in a sequence that reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned closure. No visible cost accompanies the reversal—no knowledge sacrificed, no relationship altered, no tactical price paid—so the RR/DC test fails. The piece teaches no consistent pattern by the 25% mark and offers only a decorative cascade at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when arrive early, waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by default (lyric accretion, no causal because/therefore). Closure requires a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with cost; the final image ("hope blossomed anew, a radiant hush forever echoing") restates the opening mood without reweighting prior material or making a cost legible. The seed's journey from crack to spore to blossomed sprig unfolds as a sequence of wonders, not a tightening that narrows options. No visible forfeiture, no felt price, no cadence shift that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural by design, but the piece never teaches a clear pattern or offers a meaningful tightening. The "closure" is Elara placing the mask on the altar and feeling settled—no decisive change in her options, no visible cost paid, no genuine before/after in her external situation or internal stance. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when arrive early), but causality is absent: spirits are released in sequence without resistance, complication, or escalation. The final image ("lucid unrest that was, paradoxically, the purest peace") is an abstract claim rather than a charged reconfiguration earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering images (rain, stones, map tear, video reels) toward a final resonance. However, the closure relies on atmospheric assertion—"the whispered chapel now alive with a muted chorus"—rather than a legible Decisive Change or cost. The Orientation Test applies: who/where/when are vague past 120 words (the vault, the henge, the chapel bleed together without spatial anchors), triggering −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (empathy rewrites borders) but the cost remains abstract, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchors arrive by ~120 words (waived). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but delivers no meaningful tightening or cadence shift—only a static glide through description. Closure unit: Mort rises with the snow globe and "lets the sea carry his quiet gratitude"; no decisive change, no foreclosed path, no visible cost. The ending asserts transformation ("physics of letting go revealed itself") without dramatizing it. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Mort sacrificed or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (balladeer, misty courtyard, purpose). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through graffiti layers, flower presses, and code fragments until the courtyard becomes a "living archive." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost folds into the mural, travelers continue the cycle), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no specific forfeiture or narrowing of options is legible on the page. The final beat reconfigures the premise into permanence, yet the price the balladeer pays remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—elevator rises, light unfolds diary, stairs descend, chamber reached—but lacks a decisive tightening or cost. The closure image (crystal jars warming the walls, servant ascending with contentment) reconfigures emotional state but the cost remains abstract: no visible forfeiture, no option foreclosed. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The "because" chain is present but mechanical; each step enables the next without narrowing options or raising price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the piece maintains uniform contemplative register from opening to close. The closure unit—Aria walking away carrying memory—lacks visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no path blocked. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within range, but the "after the string broke" timeframe remains vague and does not constrain action. The ending records rather than reconfigures, missing the felt or conceptual cost required for RR or CR.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece attempts an accumulative design but never tightens or reweights the dominant stake. The demolition "scheduled for noon" arrives without altering tactics; Lira finishes on time, the mural "holds its shimmer," and the safe remains closed—no decisive change, no visible cost, no Charged Poise that crystallizes options. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (first anchor ~180 words into fragmented description), triggering −0.4 here and capping Q3 at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)
    The closure unit—harnessing the luminance—occurs on the page but lacks felt cost; the ship "hummed anew" and the crew "felt a warm presence" without any price paid or option foreclosed. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce slowly across the opening, and the hopscotch board materializes abruptly in the middle third without prior anchoring. Causality is weak: the phrasebook clues and chalk-drawn pattern succeed immediately with no resistance, reading as convenient discovery rather than earned breakthrough. Under a hybrid lens (leaning Accumulative), the piece needed one tightening or deepening that narrowed options; instead, every step advances smoothly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: images and objects accrue without causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the clock ticks, the locksmith departs with it), but the cost is asserted ("heart heavy") rather than legible in a choice or forfeiture. The prophecy scraps, mirror hall, and gear assembly proceed in and-then fashion; no decision narrows options or reweights the dominant stake through visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. However, there is no on-page closure with felt cost: the bell rings, the nebula brightens, everyone promises cooperation—no decision forecloses a path, no renunciation imposes price, no stance crystallizes against resistance. The story summarizes collective harmony rather than dramatizing a reversal or reconfiguration. Drive lens is accumulative-textural in aspiration, but the final image adds glow without reweighting prior stakes or showing visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and why she's summoned emerges through poetic assertion rather than grounded anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. Causality is largely absent—gears respond "as if acknowledging," the pane "materializes," and the lullaby succeeds without resistance or cost-bearing choice on Elara's part. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in image form, but no on-page decisive change or felt cost accompanies it; the lighthouse simply "stood as a keeper of peace" without Elara forfeiting or altering anything tangible. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in intent, yet the final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and mechanical birds arrive with context scattered across the first third, though the cliffside orchard frame becomes clear by midpoint. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and symbolic layering build toward the nut-placement ritual, and the closure image (light spilling, travelers emerging) reweights the premise with visible cost—the orchard "still cursed" and the caretaker's role cyclic. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; the protagonist's emotional or relational price is asserted ("bitter sweetness... like ash") but not dramatized through forfeited options or visible struggle at the closure beat. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, and the ritual completes that arc, but the lack of on-page felt cost in the final image holds this below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches a clear pattern or escalates density toward closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—Mara's return to the ravine and the child's chrysalis shell—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no prior option reweighted with felt consequences. The ending recycles the opening metaphor without deepening it causally or emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who (vendor), where (glass orchard library), and when (opening day lull) are named early, so no penalty. However, no meaningful causal linkage or pressure tightening occurs—the vendor's act of placing the bottle triggers atmospheric description but no resistance, complication, or cost. The "closure" (handing the bottle to the child, moonlight streaming) is a tableau rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost; the vendor's quest dissolves "into the very air" without forfeiting anything on the page. The piece reads as a lyric catalog of images under an Accumulative lens, but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with atmospheric description but withholds clear orientation: who Lir is beyond "Chef," why he has come, and what concrete outcome he seeks remain vague past the opening third. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—building sensory density and recurring imagery (coral, tide, remorse as flavor)—but the ending delivers only tonal release ("the sweet promise of memory he could now season") without a visible cost or reconfiguration that reweights prior stakes. The coral cracking "with a sigh" and the sandstorm carrying away remorse feel cosmetic rather than causal, and no on-page choice or renunciation anchors the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation arrives late and remains vague: "old city," "astronomical clock tower," "silo network" establish genre texture but no concrete geography or timeline anchor by ~120 words. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural—interspersed languages weave into bridges—but causality is opaque: the weight's chime somehow makes workers emerge and lay planks without dramatized agency or constraint. The closure image (city breathing, silos singing) offers lyric resonance but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; the librarian's action succeeds without friction, and no price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who and where early enough (Aria, canyon, moonlit night) and signals a dominant stake (interfacing the mirror with the canyon's memory). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mirror's calibration, the canyon's hum, and the projection of memories build density and charge the final image of dawn and gathered shards. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Aria walks away "ready to catalog the next abandoned dream"—but the cost is oblique; no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path is legible on the page, only a faint echo and a promise that "stories…would endure." The tremor mid-scene offers a micro reversal but does not narrow options or raise price in a way that reweights the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Liora is and what she specifically seeks remains abstract past the first third. The closure unit (planting seedlings, making a promise) occurs on the page but the cost is conceptual only, announced rather than felt through a trade-off or visible loss. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric detail accrues toward a final image), but pressure never meaningfully tightens or reweights the stake; the grotto sequence unfolds as a guided tour with no reversals or altered tactics. Causality is weak: the doodle "appears without explanation," gravity inverts on schedule, the cipher resolves when symbols are aligned without friction, and the glyph dissolves into seedlings without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Auris performs a series of actions (strumming cracks, resonating the insulator) that layer detail and mood. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; each beat adds texture without narrowing options or raising stakes. The ending claims a transformation ("the grove finally heard a song") but provides no visible cost or foreclosed path—the world simply shifts from silent to resonant without dramatized consequence or trade-off, leaving closure felt but not earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when are named but remain vague placeholders (forgotten plateau, twilight, magnetic currents) without concrete spatial or temporal anchors past the ~120-word threshold; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost—he simply walks "ready to rewrite the covenant," a stated intention rather than an on-page alteration of options or meaning. The Drive Lens remains ambiguous (oscillates between lyric-accumulative and symbolic-causal without teaching a pattern or landing coherently), triggering an additional −0.4 and capping all categories at 8.0. Causality is replaced by metaphoric declaration; placing imagined chess pieces and speaking a phrase produce a "thin sliver of light" and pattern clarity through narrative assertion rather than earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: the workshop's purpose, the diary's ownership, and the protagonist's relationship to both remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The "quest" structure is told rather than dramatized; beats advance by theatrical description rather than causal linkage. The closure—diary pages revealing invisible ink when named silences are whispered—lacks on-page cost: nothing is foreclosed, no prior tactic fails, and the protagonist simply succeeds at his stated mission without friction. The piece reads Accumulative in aspiration (catalog of silences, crystal plates, naming ritual) but never tightens or deepens meaningfully; the final rooftop scene adds fireworks and crowds without altering the protagonist's stance or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure: the seed blooms, villagers gather, and the custom continues, but no before/after change in options, knowledge, or stance is legible. The piece is a static chronicle of growth without reversal, cost, or decisive reconfiguration. Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization is clear. Orientation Test waived (who/where/when anchored early), but the lack of closure severely limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates sensory detail and thematic motifs toward a final release-and-renewal image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the broken tip dissolves into particles promising "endless cycles"—but the cost is abstract and off-page (future promise rather than present forfeiture). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tip's resonance accelerates growth, yet Mira's choice to release it carries no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (port city, post-storm, investigator surveying containers). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—wind data accretes until a convergence point is identified. However, the climax (whispering into the wind; vortex releases) lacks on-page causality: why does her voice trigger the release? The closure unit (the town's pulse returns) appears as a consequence but the mechanism remains opaque, weakening the cost legibility required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    No identifiable closure unit: the bell ringer enters, sings, leaves, and imagines future travelers in an undifferentiated sequence. The orientation test is waived (setting anchors early), but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The final paragraph offers abstract moralizing ("beauty could be both still and moving") rather than a reweighted image with cost. Lens remains ambiguous (neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern with break is taught); applying Hybrid by default, but even so, no meaningful tightening or deepening alters options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening and follows an Accumulative lens: Mara arranges markers, plays the flute, enters the seam, retrieves insight, returns. The closure reconfigures her mission statement ("guardianship is woven from quiet failures"), but the cost remains conceptual—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift ties the insight to an on-page sacrifice. The seam-crossing moment feels resolved by the flute's mechanics rather than Mara's earned struggle, softening the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with spatial anchors (topaz workshop, stars) but "who" remains vague past the 120-word mark—Mara's goal and situation emerge only through abstract claims rather than scene pressure, triggering a minor orientation penalty. The dominant stake (understanding emotion's mathematics) is declared but never tested on the page by a decision or reversal. The halo fragment's crack at the end gestures toward closure, but no visible cost or foreclosed option appears; Mara simply collects shards and promises to continue tomorrow, which reads as stasis without the price required for Earned Stasis. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (pendant glow, aurora, vibration) accumulate toward a thematic statement about myth-making. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the ridgeway becomes pilgrimage site, wonder spreads across generations—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page action forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt pressure. The courier vanishes into glow without agency or sacrifice, and the coda tells us legend has germinated rather than showing a decisive image. Orientation is clean (aurora-lit ridgeway, jittery courier, pendant established early). The sequence proceeds by accretion rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens, but the ending delivers theme summary instead of a charged final image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (mystic, prism, quartz arbor). The piece follows a single continuous scene with Liora as sole POV and operates under a blended Accumulative/Situational lens: pressure accumulates through textural layering (mist, frost, light, grief) and crystallizes in Liora's recognition that "emotions did not merely pass through objects; they settled, colored, and altered them." However, closure relies on conceptual assertion rather than on-page cost—Liora's journal entry and vow to share the discovery are told, not dramatized as choices that foreclose options or exact visible price. The car engine sputtering to life reads as coincidental magic rather than causally earned consequence, weakening the closure unit's felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who Mara is, why she's in this orchard, and what the raveling silence threatens remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The closure unit (bead dims, message sent, silence retreats) occurs on the page but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "her own quiet sacrifice had become the very warp" is told, not shown through a specific forfeiture or altered state. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery of loom, silence, light), but the final image does not reweight prior material with legible pressure—Mara simply turns back, the orchard glows faintly, and the pattern "settled into a new pattern" without visible before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: "meek blacksmith" and "orchard planet" appear early, but no spatial anchor (workshop location relative to anything) or temporal frame emerges until deep into the piece. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered images of azure, defiance, rubble-to-resilience), but the closure—blade striking stone, cracks becoming crystal vines—is asserted without prior setup of world-rules or cost. The "bartered awakening" (memory exchange) happens off-page in a hum; the silk's attachment and the blade's singing are told, not dramatized with visible consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs; the blacksmith's journey from workshop to cavern to forge proceeds in and-then sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: "who" is named at line two, but "where" (the repair bay's spatial logic) and "when" (present? memory? dream state?) remain vague past 120 words, undercutting the Orientation Test. The closure—awakening the crew and scattering the shard—occurs on the page, but cost is abstract: "weight…lift[ed], replaced by lightness" tells emotional change without showing a forfeited option or felt price. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (sensory maps, green shard, cyclical rhythm layered across beats), yet the final move feels like a list-check resolution rather than a tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors are present early (Marek, lighthouse, night). However, no meaningful causal turn occurs: Marek stacks stones, the room "exhales," he leaves, then inexplicably returns with his "heart alight." The supposed closure—stones glowing, lantern room "glowing once more"—is asserted by narrative fiat rather than earned through protagonist decision or reversal. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the final image lacks visible cost or a legible before/after change in options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    The Orientation Test fails: who Mira is, her relationship to the herald, and the stakes of the ritual remain vague past 120 words, never anchored in concrete causality. The "otherworldly routine" is declared but never dramatized as a problem or constraint that narrows options. The ending gesture—raising the lantern and whispering a vow—offers no legible before/after change in Mira's situation or knowledge; the "new dawn" and "shadowed brilliance" are asserted themes, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost on the page. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: events accumulate without causal linkage or a situational stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never deepens or reweights a stake—it simply tours symbolic set-pieces (wing, scrolls, loom) in linear sequence. Orientation is delayed: who Lira is, where the tea house sits, and what she seeks remain vague past the 120-word mark. The "closure" is Lira stepping onto the loom and releasing light, but this is a static tableau with no felt cost or choice that forecloses a path. The script's answer—"stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution"—arrives as convenient exposition rather than hard-won discovery, and no tactic or option changes afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test failure: by ~120 words we have "stormlit tower," "labyrinth," "echo-grid," and "astronomer's broken sextant" without clear who-where-when anchors or the nature of Eli's task (−0.4). The piece summarizes the deconstruction in a single sentence ("deconstructed the echo-grid layer by layer") without showing a decision that narrows options; the sextant's supposed healing and the grid's relief occur passively. No on-page reversal or cost forecloses a path; the "quantified sorrow lift[s]" by authorial declaration. Closure reads as Told Transformation with no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is vague: "mirror world" and "alchemical orchard greenhouse" anchor setting by name but not spatial or temporal boundaries within the opening window. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens—density increases through layered imagery—but no decisive change, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs; Lira's purpose is declared at the start and simply enacted without opposition or cost. The final paragraph asserts "permanent sunrise" and "never again surrender to silence" as outcomes, but these are told resolutions rather than on-page closure with felt price. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Lira forfeits or what path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story anchors who and what early (recluse, invitation, library) but "where" remains vague—"rain‑kissed town" is placeholder setting. The invitation's arrival and library descent follow an and-then sequence without causal pressure tightening options. The mirror-epiphany closure offers Conceptual Repricing but the cost is asserted ("to hide it was to deny the very heart") rather than made visceral through a forfeited path or visible consequence. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending restates the premise without reweighting prior material through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "the palace" and "palace courtyard" offer no who-where-when anchor, and "after the birds fly south" functions as atmosphere rather than a legible time marker (−0.4). No causal linkage drives the sequence; discovering the bread, carrying it to the tea house, slicing it, and offering it to an empty chair are sequential gestures without because/therefore pressure. The ending dissolves into atmospheric summary ("whenever a passerby stumbles") rather than landing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake—only thematic assertion replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Textural/Accumulative lens through density of image and recursive phrasing ("quartz hush," "luminous vows"). Orientation anchors are present early (frozen library, records chief, lantern slide task). The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final whispered vow reweights the premise that memory can be measured and preserved. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or decision alters her options on the page, and the slide's awakening feels more like a successful completion than a transformation with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Lila is, what the truce entails, and why lanterns matter emerge piecemeal across the first third, forcing re-reads. The plot moves through because/therefore linkage (decoy → confusion → lantern theft → darkness), but the closure—placing the watch fob and whispering a hope—offers no decisive change or visible cost; the truce was always time-limited, and her success changes no options on the page. The final image recurs to the watch fob without reweighting prior stakes or forecloses a path. Closure reads as arrival rather than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece opens with orientation anchors (Arin, lavender bluff, aurora) by the first paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, no causal escalation or meaningful tightening occurs—events are presented in additive sequence (he tastes, the ring flickers, carriers gather, forest votes, aurora fades) without because/therefore linkage or a decision that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing ("taste of the planet's secret heart") but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page; no prior choice or renunciation makes the closure legible as a before/after with felt price. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but without a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with visible cost, closure remains thematic claim rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (cavern, Lena, broken lock) and delivers a closure effect—lock opens, vial emerges, painting seals the crack—but the causal chain relies on convenient symbolic alignment rather than motivated tactics. The mirror-reflection solving the lock reads as authorial gift; no prior beat establishes why this method would work or what Lena risked in attempting it. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (layering symbols), yet the ending's cost is asserted ("heart untangle") rather than visibly paid. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the closure lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing—candor as restorative force—but the cost is atmospheric rather than personal or causal. The narrative moves by conjunction ("That night... She decided... She stepped through...") without because/therefore pressure narrowing options. The map functions as a tour guide to pre-solved locations (bottles waiting, vent pre-rigged to respond) rather than a constraint that forces trade-offs. Orientation is swift (greenhouse city, calligrapher, toxic sky by line three), preventing further penalty, but the closure image (vines singing, sky healed) asserts thematic victory without on-page sacrifice or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge gradually across the opening third without deliberate disorientation that pays off, triggering a −0.4 deduction. No causal linkage or meaningful escalation appears; the piece offers a series of static descriptions rather than because/therefore pressure. The ending whispers a "promise that the symphonies of truth will never be silenced" and asserts "hope glistens," but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost occurs—the tuner's situation and stance remain identical from first line to last. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is adequate: android, dome, desert roses established early. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern and image density rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: the box transforms from fear repository to "seed of calm," static dissolves to "fragmented wholeness." However, the cost is asserted ("burned away the static") rather than dramatized; no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible price. The controlled burn succeeds without complication, making the ending feel declarative rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost: Mara opens the mailbox, reads letters, arranges an exhibit, and guides a boy—each beat succeeds without resistance or trade-off. The ending image (locket opening to "a sound only the heart can hear") offers lyric resonance but no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with felt consequence. Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what she wants emerge only after the locket and storyteller appear (~200 words in). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never tightens or deepens—stakes remain static across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed beyond 120 words—Selene's goal, the lab's physical state, and the immediate situation emerge only through accumulation of atmospheric fragments. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending ("the lab rose like a phoenix") offers no legible cost or decisive change; it declares liberation and legend without showing what Selene renounced or what path closed. The "compartment that housed a glowing crystal" arrives as coincidence, not earned causality. No on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) with felt cost is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where are anchored by ~120 words, but the "when" remains vague beyond "weeks ago." The story offers a long string of and-then moves—Mara brews coffee, enters the chamber, kneels, presses a flower, flame grows—without motivated causality or meaningful reversal. The closure image (whale's silence "now rest in the crystal chamber") is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost; no decisive change or felt consequence lands. Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words (we learn "she" and "brook" early, but who she is and why she is here arrives only through retrospective exposition). The ritual proceeds as a sequence of steps without reversal, complication, or agency—she places the wing, chants, the wing glows, mission complete. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the prophecy is "sealed" by declaration, not dramatized cost. The lens is ambiguous (accumulative texture without a causal turn or situational crystallization), and closure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but the closure unit lacks a decisive change or visible cost. The story presents a series of agreements and lessons without a narrowing of options or meaningful transformation—the protagonist simply continues to attend lessons. The ending offers summary ("each lie a bridge") rather than an on-page moment where cost is legible. Under an inferred Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage dissolves into "and then" sequencing after the initial meeting is arranged.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation fails the 120-word test: who Lira is, where the garden exists in time/space, and what quarantined memory concretely means remain vague well past the opening third. The dominant lens is ambiguous—poetic accumulation competes with a causal frame (cataloguing echoes to translate isolation), yet neither coheres into escalation. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the seashell "pulses," the ledger "hums," and morning arrives on schedule without Lira's agency altering tactics or cost. Closure reads as atmospheric arrival rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words the reader knows "marble sanctuary under aurora" and "calligraphy forger" but not who Liora is relationally, what immediate problem drives tonight's work, or what concrete outcome she seeks. The closure unit—tracing hidden verses onto the floor—lacks a legible before/after: no on-page evidence shows what changes for Liora or the world after the verses resonate. The key "melts into the stone, its purpose fulfilled" without demonstrable cost or foreclosed path, reading as a symbolic gesture rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece reads partly accumulative (pearl twilight, dripping water, recurring thorn) yet offers no cadence shift or density break that reweights the dominant stake at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is absent: by line 120 the reader has starlight, canyon, and "serpentine nexus" but no concrete spatial anchor or character name—apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test. The narrative unfolds as a walking catalog of revelations granted without causal linkage: the cavern "responded by projecting a lattice" and "the hymn swelled, carrying the answers she sought" with no protagonist agency driving the discoveries. Closure is delivered by coincidence (finding the whole shell waiting) rather than earned through prior choices, and the final image lacks visible cost—she emerges with a now-whole shell and walks toward the horizon with no path foreclosed or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words (shrine, glacier, whisperer established early), so no penalty applied here. Drive lens is ambiguous—partly accumulative (dream cataloging), partly causal (whisper → vapor window), yet the piece never commits; by closure the mechanism remains decorative rather than pressure-driven, triggering −0.4 for lens drift and capping Q2 at 7.2. Closure form: the "melted snow globe pulsed brighter" and "fragment had already begun its journey home" is told reassurance, not a dramatized reversal with on-page cost; Cost Proof Test fails—no exact sentence shows a visible price paid or option foreclosed at the ending beat. The story summarizes a process (recording dreams, embedding a cameo) but never dramatizes a pivotal on-page turn where the whisperer's action narrows her own options or generates new friction. Applying Non-closure Accumulation Cap for two distinct issues (lens ambiguity, cost absence): −1.5 within Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never teaches a clear pattern or applies meaningful pressure. The piece loops through atmospheric observation without escalation: fireflies appear, philosopher whistles, walks moon paths, returns next evening to repeat. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs; the final image ("luminous chorus...quiet mechanics humming") restates the opening thesis without reweighting prior material or landing cost. Orientation is met early, but the absence of on-page closure with felt consequence is disqualifying.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (wasteland orchard, post-liquidation), satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure unit—Mira's realization that "the hidden stillpoint was not a place but a mental state triggered by the diamond's focus"—arrives as a convenient epiphany unsupported by prior causal pressure; the diamond's inscription and the dust-storm cessation are presented as reveals rather than consequences of her choices. The plot follows an outline-like "and-then" structure (collect fragments → reassemble → find diamond → understand) without meaningful tightening or a felt cost at the ending. Under a Causal lens, the protagonist's agency does not narrow options or foreclose a path; under an Accumulative lens, no cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words (who is this visionary? when? why now?), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece declares a quest and its success without causal linkage: mirrors "sing," coils "hum," drones are commissioned off-page, and dawn arrives as gift rather than earned consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs—the visionary's early goal ("forge variant allegiance") is simply achieved in the final paragraph without on-page reversal or cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost; instead, the text loops ornamental descriptions without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, layering images of sounds captured in jars, but no meaningful tightening or choice narrows options; the poet's method succeeds without friction. The child's arrival at the end gestures toward closure but lacks visible cost: the poet feels redemption without forfeiting anything on the page. The final image offers resonance but no legible price paid, so the Resonant Reconfiguration remains incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece signals closure as Elara securing the Heart and feeling absolution, but the cost is conceptual assertion ("purpose fulfilled") rather than a legible on-page forfeiture or reversal. The orientation test is passed (who/where/when anchored early), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: the sequence reads as a checklist of technical steps (causal surface) wrapped in accumulative atmosphere without a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The ending delivers stasis without demonstrating what was risked or renounced to achieve it. No on-page beat shows Elara altering tactics or making a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, so no penalty applies. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through repeated moon-path imagery and magnetic-pulse motifs, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Elara waits, records, feels release, with no causal pressure narrowing her options. The closure image ("unyoke the rush, honor the still" / "the frozen world itself had granted her a small freedom") offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page choice forecloses a path. The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a specific sentence where Elara pays a visible price at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece anchors who and where quickly (Mara, tunnel, lantern). A closure effect is visible—the valve turn and water redirection—but the cost remains abstract: "loosen[ing] the controlling influence of the city's old bureaucratic neglect" and a "collective gratitude" are conceptual rather than viscerally felt or concretely forfeited on the page. The cause-effect chain is present (seepage pattern → hidden conduit → valve → redirection), but the final beat reads as logistical success without a visible personal or relational price that would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who the chaplain is addressing (the shopkeeper) and why he seeks a "second opinion" on an object already in her shop remains unclear until midway through. The closure—heart beats, he feels triumph, receives a music box—registers as a successful repair rather than a costly reconfiguration; no prior option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The lens reads as weakly causal (chaplain decides → heart works) but the because/therefore linkage is mechanical rather than pressure-driven, and the ending offers emotional satisfaction without dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece presents a quest to ring the bell, executed and completed, yielding a moment of satisfaction for the algorithm. However, the closure carries no visible cost or foreclosed path: Mara laughs, the gears cheer, and she immediately sets a new course with the prism. The "yearn satisfied" beat functions as a micro turn, but the piece pivots to "next mystery" without consequence, reading as a soft reset rather than decisive change or charged poise. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Drive lens reads Causal-lite with Accumulative texture, but the ending dissipates pressure rather than reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lia follows breadcrumbs through metadata, fabricates a post, enters a hidden server, unlocks a vault, and publishes the discovery. The pattern coheres, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—each step simply adds information without narrowing options or raising cost. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the crew's message: "We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence"), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract and the final image does not reweight prior stakes with felt pressure. Orientation is adequate by ~120 words, so no penalty applies there.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story opens with vague spatial anchors ("lighthouse orchard," "shifting ice floes") that remain ungrounded past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The inferred lens is Accumulative, but the closure—mirrors knitting the crystal whole—arrives without legible cost or a before/after that the protagonist's choices produced; the mirrors "sighed" and "glowed" autonomously. The final image ("world breathe in unison") asserts resonance rather than dramatizing a felt or conceptual price, and the causal chain from whisper to mirror-use lacks motivated linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive early (sunrise, marina, protagonist alone), satisfying the test. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by midpoint through recurring images (lace tip, wind, ice) and tonal modulation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final parasol-tip reprise and acceptance whisper, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no live option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical sacrifice made on the page. The link between "fold in patience" and the protagonist's journey is told more than shown, weakening the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where early ("lone vineyard sentinel," "amber pavilion"), satisfying the test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by the lyric density and focus on image repetition, yet no single beat tightens options or reweights cost with undeniable pressure. The piece offers a conceptual repricing in the final paragraph ("mismatched destinies could converge"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page—no line points to a specific forfeiture, injury, or lost option. Closure form is present but cost legibility fails the proof test, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: the half-masked line walker's identity and the pavilion's function emerge gradually through abstraction rather than concrete situation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the Keeper performs the same meditative gestures from start to finish. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final departure image, but no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page—he simply continues his prior wandering with renewed understanding that was never tested. The kinetic parapet's "conjured clearing" functions as atmospheric set-dressing rather than a constraint that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece violates the Orientation Test: past ~120 words, the reader still cannot anchor who the villagers are, when they arrive relative to Mara's setup, or how the dove gray case relates causally to the photographs. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Mara arranges images, villagers appear, tears and smiles happen, feather is lifted—each step is additive description, not causal linkage. The ending ("collective healing felt complete, yet also the beginning") offers Charged Poise language but no felt or conceptual cost is legible on the page; the outcome was assured from the premise. Orientation penalty (−0.4) and no closure cost apply; additional cap per Orientation Test: Q3 capped at 7.0, all categories capped at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words passes narrowly. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of echoes and light), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Mara observes, records, realizes, and leaves without a decisive constraint or cost that changes her options. The "realization" that fractured sequences encode language growth is told, not dramatized through a choice or renunciation. Closure unit is unclear: the final offering (folded page) and the crystal's "promise" gesture toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lack visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (lyric procession toward a final resonant image). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words; no penalty. The piece follows a quest structure—locate chalk, navigate garden, inscribe the sound—but escalation reads as textural accumulation rather than causal tightening. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of chalk dust and the ghost-ship horn, yet the cost is asserted ("even the most forgetful seer can trace a line of hope") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or stance shift. The prophet's smile and the garden's agreement feel declarative, not earned through prior constraint or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.8)
    Closure exists as a physical completion (the clock hand slows, the device "held its course"), but cost remains abstract and asserted rather than legible in a decisive image or forfeited path. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural in ambition (recurring "luminous ache," leaf motif), yet the final paragraph recycles earlier phrases without reweighting them through new pressure or a conceptual repricing. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and concrete spatial anchors emerge slowly across the first third—triggering a −0.4 deduction and cross-category caps per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening lines, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, no meaningful causality drives the sequence: Mara enters, places the vinyl, plays her harp, and the patient dies on schedule—each beat is ceremonial rather than motivated by prior pressure or a narrowing of options. The closure offers no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing; the "scent of hope" and vinyl fragment are declared whole without on-page friction or sacrifice. Under a Causal lens the linkage is missing; under Accumulative/Textural the density does not deepen or break pattern at the end; the piece reads as static ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through repeated "closing loops" imagery). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening ~100 words (rune scholar, floating isle, nocturnal observatory). A closure unit is present—Lira completes the loop ritual, the doorway opens, shadows stream out, and she presses the key into the arch—but the cost is conceptual at best: she "catalogued the routes with quiet joy," and the island "settle[s]," offering satisfaction rather than a visible price paid. The escalation reads as procedural (night after night tracing glyphs) without a tightening that narrows her options or raises stakes; the key simply works when the final glyph aligns. Under the Accumulative lens, the closure should reweight the dominant stake with felt cost, but the ending delivers encyclopedic completion ("a map of all the places shadows had visited") rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; "garden behind the hedge maze" and "substitute body" appear early but Mara's goal, the scholar's situation, and the changeling tooth's function remain vague until mid-text, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with a quasi-causal repair sequence—and neither holds cleanly at closure. The ending offers no decisive change or visible cost: Mara "laughs softly," gathers the tooth as a keepsake, and returns to map stars, delivering summary satisfaction rather than on-page reconfiguration. No foreclosed path, no felt price, no legible RR or CR—closure validity fails.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is vague past 120 words—who she is beyond "earthbound star watcher," when this occurs, and why now remain unclear. The piece reads as a single extended tableau rather than a causal sequence: she enters, arranges glass, visitors feel peace (off-page), she smiles. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the "purpose" is declared complete without on-page friction. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost or a legible before/after shift in her stance or situation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but *when* remains vague—"a month earlier" offers backstory without present temporal stakes. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural by intent (drip pattern, moss growth, code rewriting), yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift narrows Lira's options; she moves through beats without resistance. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image (fireflies, pulse of data), but cost is never made legible on the page—her action succeeds without sacrifice, foreclosing nothing. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies for unclear temporal pressure; closure lacks felt cost under the Accumulative lens, preventing access to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed: by ~120 words the reader knows only "conflicted novelist" in "feral nexus in mist"; the nature of the task, the stakes, and the physical reality remain abstract. The piece unfolds as a lyric meditation rather than a causally linked sequence—hopes appear as "ephemeral cameo," the fragment hums, the mist applauds—without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she will return, the journey continues), but cost is asserted ("solemn promise") rather than shown; no visible choice or renunciation occurs on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but density does not meaningfully increase or break pattern at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes who (Mara), where (ancient forest glade/arbor), and when (dawn before harvest moon rises) within the first paragraph, meeting orientation requirements. However, the causal chain is weak: the lyre playing "coaxes" the vine to unfurl golden light-threads that somehow constitute "the remedy"—a mechanism asserted rather than built through prior constraint or cost. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the valley's practices endure, Mara returns each harvest moon), but the cost is conceptual only; no on-page forfeiture or visible price accompanies her vow, and the final image of children learning songs feels like summary rather than a charged moment that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early but closure remains elusive: the final "seal held" and promise to return do not constitute a Decisive Change, and no cost is legible on the page—she simply continues her routine. The covenant declaration in the penultimate section attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks dramatized pressure or a felt price; it reads as summary rather than an earned shift. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options; the alchemist arranges debris, whispers a formula, and the light settles without complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, when), satisfying the test. However, no causal escalation appears—Corin observes, fashions a crystal, inserts it, and succeeds without setback or meaningful tightening. The "closure" is a completion of a project rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the jar fills, travelers later hear it, and Corin continues unchanged. Under a Causal lens (the most generous reading given "reverse-engineer"), because/therefore linkage is present but pressure never narrows options or forces a tradeoff, leaving the ending as summary rather than enacted closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors emerge slowly: who (fractal weaver) and where (bronze grotto) are present early, but when (after first snowmelt) and why lack immediacy; no penalty applied since the lyric mode is signaled. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ritual actions layer toward a final release—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the weaver performs her task without friction, and the closure (placing the feather, flare, departure) reconfigures atmosphere but lacks visible cost or a legible before/after in her stance or options. The method (orienting the lamp, inviting weights, transmuting into a feather) proceeds without resistance, so pressure never coheres into a turn or a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, rust hue, kettle steam, and carved amber accumulate toward a final image of "rust-hued peace" as acceptance. Orientation anchors (widow, loft, carving blank) arrive early. However, the closure—Mara placing the lantern and feeling the lesson settle—registers as conceptual summary rather than a decisive image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The kettle's boil recurs but does not narrow options; it marks time without altering tactics. One meaningful deepening (sap hardening into memory vault) appears mid-story, but the ending defaults to explanation ("loss can be a tool, not a trap") rather than letting the image alone reconfigure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (kinetic lagoon, carousel platform, post-halt timeframe) but causality remains vague throughout. The ghost's appearance, its demands, and the "trade" mechanic are declared rather than dramatized with clear because/therefore linkage. The closure—Mara accepting a memory and the ghost fading—lands as thematic Echo rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. No visible option is foreclosed; the "pact" feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the opening, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous throughout—shifts between causal engineering problem-solving and accumulative lyric meditation never cohere. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the activated beacon, but cost is absent: the intern faces no trade-off, loses nothing, and the "resurrected hope" arrives through technical success without personal sacrifice or foreclosed path. The carnival's departure is mentioned but never pressures the engineering work; the two threads (emotional loss vs. technical resurrection) run parallel without causal linkage or convergence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.8)
    Who/where/when anchor by the first paragraph, no orientation penalty. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural drive but lacks a decisive tightening or cadence shift that narrows options; the scribe simply completes the numerals without facing any obstacle or cost that changes his tactics. The closure ("made peace") is asserted in summary rather than landing through a final image that reweights prior material. Cost is claimed ("abandoned dream settle into his chest") but not dramatized—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, so no penalty applies there. However, no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost occurs—the seeker boards, fixes a lock, and continues with identical resolve. The "architecture of lies" crumbles offstage in metaphor; no forfeiture or reconfiguration alters his stance. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) could support lyric closure, but the final image recycles the opening frame without reweighting stakes or imposing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost appears at closure—the final image ("the rope revealed a spiral… ready to be shared") is a declaration of readiness, not an enacted shift that forecloses options or reweights stakes. The piece unfolds as a series of descriptive tableaux without causal linkage; each paragraph could be reordered with minimal impact. Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by default, but no density increase or cadence shift charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed and vague: by ~120 words we know only "shadowed garden in autumn" with no clear spatial grounding or immediate stake. The piece unfolds as a single descriptive tableau rather than causally linked beats; the traveler arrives, observes, writes, and departs without any reversal or tightening that narrows options. Closure is a conceptual echo—"the world whispered back"—but no visible, felt, or conceptual cost is legible on the page; the final image reiterates the opening premise without reweighting it. Under an Accumulative lens the density never shifts decisively, and under Causal the because/therefore linkage is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors appear early (who, where, when), but the closure effect—the prince's smile and radiant transformation—lacks visible cost or meaningful constraint. The piece declares renewal and harmony but never dramatizes what the prince forfeits or what path is foreclosed. Under a hybrid lens (accumulative texture moving toward a decisive change), the ending asserts transformation without showing the price paid on the page. The "bitterly sweet pact" is named but not felt, and the final image recycles the setup without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    No on-page closure effect with felt cost. The opening promises a migration-driven ritual, but the lagoon setting remains static; Mira fastens the coin, the thread glows, villagers gather—no decision alters tactics, no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The final paragraph summarizes thematic resonance ("clouds carried the song") rather than dramatizing a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is present (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative patterning (recurring "scars," "fire," "thread") yet never delivers a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with cost. The graft "holds" by assertion, not dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece orients who/where/when adequately early and tracks Mara through a quest structure, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the box opens, memories float away, fountains hum, and Mara smiles—nothing is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The "defiant hush" and "sidereal patience" remain atmospheric claims rather than constraints that narrow options. Under a causal lens (the piece teaches because/therefore in the breadcrumb sequence), the final act should cost something; under an accumulative lens, the ending should reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—neither occurs. The Orientation Test is satisfied, but closure validity is compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The piece offers no causal linkage (because/therefore); events accumulate in a lyric register, but the lens remains ambiguous—neither fully Accumulative (no decisive pattern break or cadence shift) nor Situational (no crystallized stance). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the gear seeds "future dawns"), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page forfeit or reweighted option is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (Eliam, greenhouse, dusk), but the drive lens remains ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal mentorship without clarifying which governs closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the carved basin monument), yet the cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page; no sentence makes visible what Eliam loses or forecloses by this act. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it illustrates a thesis already stated. Accumulative density peaks mid-story (ribbon, butterfly spiral, poems), then plateaus rather than tightening options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Mara is and what she seeks emerge gradually through abstract phrasing rather than concrete early anchor (−0.4). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (ritual layering, lyric repetition), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—each paragraph restates the same ritual without escalation or reversal. Closure requires a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with cost; here the pendulum resumes and Mara pledges to continue, a static affirmation without visible cost or foreclosed path. The final image ("next cracked gear") repeats the opening premise rather than reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric lens with clear spatial anchors (cemetery, silo, case) established early. However, closure relies on a conceptual claim—"the shape of intentions was a circle"—delivered through summary rather than an image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The chess-clock timeframe is mentioned once and never constrains a choice. The structure reads as a single reflective scene without meaningful tightening or reversal; the gardener's discovery unfolds without escalation or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.1)
    The piece opens with spatial anchors (spire, frozen lake) but never establishes who the cartographer is as a person or when this occurs beyond "one dawn." The plot proceeds as a linear summary: commission → modeling → implementation → success, with no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The "closure" is reportage ("the kingdom's future was written") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Under a Causal lens, linkage exists but pressure never escalates; under Accumulative, no pattern is taught or broken at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with orientation anchors (Mara, ember alcove, shortwave radio) by the first paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure unit lacks a decisive change or visible cost: the broadcast succeeds, the crowd applauds, and Mara feels "quiet pride" without any path foreclosed or option reweighted on the page. The sequence reads as and-then plotting—she hears, transcribes, broadcasts, audience gathers—without because/therefore linkage or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The ending summarizes a thematic win ("dust...could become a storyteller") rather than landing a felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.8)
    No causal linkage drives the sequence—events are decorative tableaux strung by "and then" logic. The protagonist enters, sprinkles powder, whispers incantations, and leaves; no decision alters tactics, no reversal changes knowledge or options. The "fleeting emotion" is declared crystallized without on-page mechanism or cost; the gallery "responds" through ambient description, not through consequences that narrow her choices. Orientation is delayed and vague (who is she? why now? what happens if she fails?), and the ending offers atmosphere rather than a legible closure effect with felt price. The piece reads accumulative/textural in aspiration but lacks the density increase or pattern break required for Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sedimentary fragments accumulate into a map, the cog syncs with layers, and competing narratives converge. However, the closure—deciding to preserve both methods and writing a cipher—is told rather than shown; no on-page sentence dramatizes the act of inscription or the felt cost of that choice. The Accumulative pattern teaches itself through layered imagery but the final reconfiguration lacks concrete presence, reducing closure to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is severely delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; the library is described but not anchored in a town, season grounding is atmospheric only, and the teacher has no name or clear timeline. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (community reconciliation via art), but the cost is asserted ("hatred…rusting away") rather than legible on the page; no specific choice or forfeiture is shown. Causality is weak: the zither's first chord immediately loosens tension without earned resistance. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (art layering toward harmony), but the final weeks-later summary dilutes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density via motif layering), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—the greenhouse simply accumulates imagery without constraint. Orientation is delayed: who Mara is, her exact location beyond "greenhouse," and the story's present stakes remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (the greenhouse as beacon of hope), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page—no visible price paid for the transformation. Causality is ceremonial: seed → broth → vines → spores proceed without resistance or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    The orientation test fails: who, where, and when are submerged in atmosphere for the first ~200 words, forcing the reader to infer that Mara is at the tower after a blackout, but the spatial and temporal anchors remain vague ("tonight," "small office," "tower's core" appear without prior grounding). The closure—the echo returning—is asserted rather than earned; the matchbox riddle solves itself via glyphs with no prior causal linkage or cost. The lens reads as accumulative/atmospheric, but the ending delivers expository realization ("an echo...was the city's own voice") without a decisive change or felt price. The drone's emergence and the glyphs' answer appear convenient rather than caused by Mara's prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    No clear closure unit. The story circles through a series of observations and atmosphere-building without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that lands with cost. The narrator walks, buys a shard, places it on a bench, and walks away feeling aligned—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed, no felt price paid. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending offers only asserted transformation without on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when are anchored early enough. However, no legible closure unit exists—the story lists a series of garden transformations without a decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that creates a before/after. The "purpose fulfilled" declaration is told summary, not an on-page reconfiguration. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (garden changes pile up) but never teaches a pattern or lands a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or reweights cost. The ending simply stops after listing effects.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches its pattern clearly—equations, bronze contraption, and dice mechanics are summarized rather than shown affecting tactics. Orientation is vague: "At its base" and "the eighth landing" anchor space weakly, and no temporal frame is established. The ending offers a micro turn (chipped side lands face-up) but the cost is asserted ("a faint scar turned triumph") rather than made legible through prior sacrifice or foreclosed option. The staircase "quivering" and "singing" read as metaphor without causal consequence, so the closure effect (Conceptual Repricing or Resonant Reconfiguration) lacks the on-page felt or visible cost required.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraph; by ~120 words the anchors are present but hazy (−0.3 applied). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual, layered painting, note-leaving, Jiro's encounter, return to canvas. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image ("the rooftop greenhouse became a sanctuary"), but the cost is conceptual only and not legibly felt on the page—Mara's heart is "steady," the smog "puls[es] less heavily," and she simply begins again. No visible foreclosure or price paid; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story drifts in accumulative-textural mode but never crystallizes a closure unit with legible cost. The ending offers a thematic summary ("the emerald-tinted lens, the loaf of initials, and the thawing of stone hearts became the legend") rather than a decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing rooted in on-page action. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when anchor after ~180 words—and causality is diffuse: the bread's scent "coaxes" murals and "unfreezes" doors via metaphor, not motivated action. No meaningful tightening or choice narrows options; the amphitheater opens, artisans rehearse, dread melts, all without visible friction or cost paid by Liora or any individual.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Orientation Test is passed (who/where/when by ~120 words). However, closure lacks visible cost: the clock maker "vanished into the mist, his purpose fulfilled" reads as summary rather than a decisive change with on-page price. The causal chain is outline-like—he arrives, finds yoyo, spins it, engine starts, beacon lights—with no resistance or narrowing of options. The inferred lens is Causal, but linkage is convenient ("realized," "could translate") rather than because/therefore with genuine friction. No meaningful tightening occurs; each step succeeds without forcing a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test penalty applies: who Mara is, why she's here, and what "after the resuscitation of her brother's lifeless body" means remain unclear past 120 words; this debt is never paid off (−0.4). The closure unit is ambiguous—Mara whispers "vanish" and the figure dissolves, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The advisor's final bargain suggests an open choice, but Mara's response is absent, leaving closure incomplete. Causality is weak: the clasp's powers, the paradoxical notes, and the dream dictionary mechanics are asserted rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "Leeward tide prophet" is a label without grounding context, and the orchard's literal physics (why it floats, how it moves) are never anchored. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure unit—the ending loops back to the opening state ("ready to sketch another resonance") without visible cost or foreclosed path. Summarized legend ("The wind carried his name") replaces on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early enough and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through pattern motifs (spirals, shell ridges, whistle resonance). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira reframes the expedition as the city's lost willingness to listen and vows to continue. However, cost remains abstract—"sunwashed dread dissolve[s] into quiet resolve"—without a visible forfeiture or constraint that alters her options on the page. The final vow ("forever") reads as declaration rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path, weakening the closure's felt cost and capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is established (who, where, when) but the causality is purely expository: Arlen arrives, opens a mailbox, reads a letter that tells him what he already believed, then declares mission complete. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the letter's content simply validates his thesis about noble lies without altering his options or knowledge. The closure unit—placing the letter on a pedestal and declaring truth rescued—lacks visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. The story reads as a static tableau under an Accumulative lens, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake; the ending asserts transformation ("the noble lie dissolve") without dramatizing the price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece opens with anchors (drawbridge, river, Mara) but lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Mara places notes, whispers a vow, and departs; no decision narrows options, no renunciation forecloses a path, and no image reconfigures stakes with felt price. The structure is a single continuous action—wade in, place notes, leave—without a meaningful tightening or deepening that alters her situation or knowledge. The ending gesture ("knowing that each future repair…would become another stanza") is aspirational summary, not a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with a late Accumulative tilt (repeated stamp imagery). Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, when by the opening paragraph). The closure unit—pressing the stamp in the vault and the glow confirming the charter—attempts Decisive Change, but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically felt on the page. The council scene that follows diffuses the ending rather than sharpening it. One meaningful tightening occurs (vault discovery) but the escalation feels more like a checklist of reveals than causally earned narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when are present early, so no penalty applies. However, closure lacks legible cost. The basilica "glows brighter," cranes "lift off," and grief "begins to dissolve"—but no path is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The ending offers aesthetic elevation without consequence: "he finds the paradoxical peace" is asserted, not earned through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of polishing, folding, recording), yet the final cadence shift does not reweight the stake with visible cost; instead it declares resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers resonant images (geode, fissure, shards) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (floating observatory, bruised violet sky, lone survivor) arrive early. The closure—geode fracturing, shards hovering "like a constellation of hopes he could finally grasp"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concretely tied to a foreclosed path or sacrifice. The ending reweights the hunt metaphor, yet the transformation feels asserted by prose rather than earned through on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but never coheres—"brilliant dimness," "frequency of belonging," and "star trails" accumulate as atmospheric tokens without narrowing options or reweighting stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs; Lira follows the trails, presses the lever, and the chip hums to life in a frictionless sequence devoid of reversal or cost. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "after the pilgrim arrives" creates temporal fog—no clear present action frame emerges until well past that mark (−0.4). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "decoded song of belonging" but the cost is conceptual assertion only, never felt or demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the watch hand's "ticking...metronome of redemption," but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no tactic or relationship is visibly altered, only asserted. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of guilt, shore journey, carving alignment, phrase discovery), and the final cadence shift ("set the watch hand down") does reweight the opening obsession. Orientation anchors who and emotional state early but "where" (cobalt terrace) and "when" (dusk, then boat journey, then return) float without clear spatial or temporal transitions, causing brief disorientation around the boat departure and return that dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal negotiation beats, neither dominant by midpoint. Orientation remains vague: we lack clear spatial anchors for the parapet's layout, the identity of the "opposing negotiator," or the concrete mechanism of the exchange until late. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("freedom often begins with letting go"), but no visible cost appears on the page—the prisoners are released, the storm wanes, conscience at peace, all frictionless. The rope "untethered" functions as metaphor without altering tactics or forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive slowly—who, where, when coalesce only after multiple sentences of abstract musing—but the larger issue is closure. The piece offers summary transformation ("felt his sorrow dissolve into the light," "felt the alignment he had sought") without an on-page decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized poise moment that narrows options or imposes felt cost. The ending recounts emotional arithmetic ("quiet jubilation," "steady ember") rather than a final image or action that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift charges the closure; the text simply asserts resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (clue → crate → baseball → mirror → choice) but the closure—tossing the baseball and feeling the lake "breathe"—offers a Conceptual Repricing without clear cost. The protagonist's journey through the labyrinth does not narrow options or foreclose a path; instead, the ending asserts transformation ("the clean slate was not blank but rewritten") without dramatizing what was surrendered. Orientation anchors (underground lake, post-procedure) appear early, satisfying that test. The causality chain is present but the ending reconfigures meaning through declaration rather than visible price, landing the piece in mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a clear closure with felt cost. The metamorphosis and reunion happen without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options; Liora gains both bark patterns and Arion's presence with no on-page price paid. The drive lens remains ambiguous—lyric accumulation is suggested but no pattern tightens or deepens meaningfully. Orientation is delayed: who Liora is, where exactly she stands, and what concrete obstacle she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors emerge slowly and remain vague past 120 words; "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "midnight glade above clouds" offer no functional grounding. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture dominates early, but the saucer-crack sequence gestures at causal linkage without delivering motivated consequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the crystal blossom and droplet, but no felt cost or foreclosed option appears on the page; the twins simply sleep, unchanged by choice. The cartomancer's internal knot-release ("unfastened the last knot of her own heart") is told, not dramatized with a decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—who Nara is beyond a label, where exactly she works, when this occurs relative to the premise's timeline are unclear. The inciting incident (decision to stitch the veil) is missing; she is already doing it when we arrive. The "closure" (stepping through the dimension) lacks visible cost—gravity lightens, the door opens, she floats through without forfeiture or friction. Causality is associative rather than because/therefore: the tear glows, the seam cracks, the dimension opens in a sequence that feels like a list rather than linked pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    Drive lens reads situational-lyric hybrid, but pressure never crystallizes into a choice with visible cost. The ending asserts transformation ("never forgot," "uncanny timing") without showing a single on-page decision altered by the beach encounter. The prophecy frame and fisherman's arrival are coincidence-driven conveniences that resolve rather than complicate. No meaningful before/after is legible; the closure is declared rather than dramatized, and orientation drifts through celestial metaphor without grounding who/where/when by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=2.8)
    The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early, but causality is decorative: Kael "traces" and "slips" and "places," yet no because/therefore chain tightens options—the cradle activates off-page and the revolution succeeds via summary ("the garrison began to question"). The closure unit lacks on-page cost; soldiers smile and share a winking hush, but no visible price, renunciation, or stance crystallization appears. Drive lens remains ambiguous (neither causal linkage nor accumulative density shift is legible), and the ending offers thematic assertion rather than a felt reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation arrives piecemeal—"elusive eel herder" and "after the world's last friction disappears" are abstract labels rather than concrete anchors for who, where, and when by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—placing the final red stone and igniting the violet flame—occurs on the page, but the before/after change in options or stance is unclear: Selene "knew" the patterns would unfold, yet no path is visibly foreclosed or transformed with felt cost. The narrative asserts transformation ("curse turned into a compass") without dramatizing the reversal through a concrete decision or renunciation that narrows live options. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (pattern-building with painted rocks) and Causal (the dust ignition), then dissolves into thematic summary in the final third, failing the lens-clarity check at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation Test: who and where anchor early, but "when masks slip" remains abstract; the dusk claim never pressures a specific choice (−0.4). Closure unit ambiguous: the timer completes, the envelope opens, fragments glow, but no decisive change, earned refusal, or conceptual repricing with felt cost emerges—only poetic assertion that "the cartography of scars was not a wound to be healed but a terrain to be traversed." The ending describes legacy (travelers, legend, ritual) rather than landing a single, on-page reconfiguration with visible price. Drive lens unclear past midpoint; accumulative texture does not cohere into a clean closure beat (−0.5 lens drift, −0.8 for closure that displaces into summary and legacy rather than a final image with undeniable cost).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=2.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the opening paragraph. However, no legible closure unit lands: the duel itself is summarized ("each thrust was calculated"), the philosopher's return and needle-card placement introduce no new obstacle or cost, and the "answer" to the riddle is asserted rather than demonstrated. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught or paid off. Costs are declared ("dignified chaos," "shared destination") but never shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "prison library" is not anchored spatially or temporally until well into the piece, and the relationship between the opening vagrant scene and the prison setting is never clarified (−0.4 for orientation debt; Q3 capped at 7.0). No on-page decisive change occurs; the piece summarizes a year-long transformation in pure tell, then adds more summary of travelers arriving. The inferred lens is Accumulative, but no closure unit lands with cost—the final image is a declarative summary ("the blooming resistance lived on") without a visible constraint, forfeiture, or reweighted image. Causality is replaced by and-then sequencing: coffee tin appears, seeds are planted, library glows, travelers arrive, all without because/therefore linkage or motivated ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=2.8)
    Orientation Test fails: who/where/when remain metaphorical past 120 words with no anchoring details (−0.5). No legible causality—pianist floats through surreal tableaux without because/therefore linkage. The "encore" and fate-surprise are asserted outcomes, not dramatized closure with visible cost. Drive lens cannot be inferred; the piece toggles between lyric accumulation and vague causal gestures without teaching a pattern or landing a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, the ridge, pre-monsoon window) arrive cleanly within the first third. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: dream fragments accumulate, each translated symbol adds density, and the final sprouting reweights the opening premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara names the symbols and the lanterns intensify, narrowing the path to awakening. However, the closure—"the seed had indeed wakened"—lands as assertion rather than a dramatized reversal with on-page cost; the "luminous doubt" mentioned two lines earlier is rhetorically invoked but not felt as a foreclosed option or visible price paid. The monsoon's arrival is promised but not tested, so the timeframe's constraint remains potential rather than realized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure lacks visible cost: the tutor "understood" and "breathed out," the island "inhaled"—these are assertions, not on-page change with felt consequence. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~200 words in); applying the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The severance backstory and compass setup are told rather than dramatized, and no meaningful tightening narrows options before the ending.


== Grader: Deepseek V3.2 Exp ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost legible in Mara's whisper and the greenhouse's revival; accumulative lens holds strong through patterns of dust and decay, with persistent constraints shaping the final image. Orientation is anchored early, and causality is tight from hypothesis to observed changes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elya finds purpose in pauses, reinforced by the kiln's song and starlight, with felt cost from the fire's aftermath. The Accumulative lens holds through pattern-building (frost, ledger, glass), and orientation is clear early. Persistent constraints like the ledger and fire shape tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds coherently; orientation is immediate with who, where, and when anchored early; closure unit (Charged Poise) lands on-page with legible cost as music reconfigures silence into a beacon for survivors.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens, with the library's transformation offering a charged poise and felt cost in Marlow's weight lifting. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is clear early. The package arrival sets up causality, but its mystery remains unresolved, slightly dampening closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the bell's echo symbolizing hope and endurance; cost is felt in the community's isolation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through repetition. Orientation is clear early, and causality is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—the release of unused love—and cost is legible in the surge of light healing souls. Under the accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of breathing and light shifts coheres, and orientation is clear early. The viaduct and tear persistently constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through descriptive layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where time becomes palpable. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and cost is legible in the final image of loss and renewal. The structure is coherent, with the garden's completion serving as a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Plot exhibits strong causal linkages under a Causal drive lens, with Mara's actions directly leading to closure. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the closure—a Decisive Change with the wall falling and seed sprouting—lands with felt cost in the symbolic renewal. The puzzle and arrow constraints shape tactics throughout, and the ending reconfigures stakes without exposition. No causality breaks or teleporting props; structure is tight and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands with cost as Mara realizes transformation is a texture, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. The prophecy and fisherman's arrival complicate without resolving, and orientation is anchored early. The final image reweights prior material with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands decisively with the silent revolution, a before/after change felt through the garrison's awakening. Causal lens holds strong from decoding to activation, with the sundial and quill as persistent constraints. Orientation is anchored early, and cost is legible in the quiet rebellion without battle. No plot breaks or teleporting; structure is coherent and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, as Selene's realization reweights the universe's patterns with felt cost. The drive lens holds consistently, and orientation is anchored early. The persistent constraint of her curse shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where the poet reconfigures scars as a map to be traversed, with cost legible in the transformation of sorrow. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through imagery and ritual, and orientation is clear early with the stormlit observatory setting.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is strong with a Conceptual Repricing via the needle card and sundial alignment, reweighting the duel into a map for understanding. Causal lens holds with clear linkages from sundial angles to final move. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the shared victory and lingering overture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under the accumulative lens, with the library becoming a sanctuary of hope; cost is legible in the effort and growth. Orientation is clear early, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The coffee tin's introduction and the rebuilding sequence create coherent linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Charged Poise where the encore reshapes reality; cost is legible in the clock's satisfied tick and reconfigured stars. Orientation is clear early, and persistent constraint (broken clock) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands decisively with cost as the seed sprouts and the monsoon gathers, under an accumulative/textural lens that holds. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of time shapes tactics. The drive lens is coherent, with dream interpretation leading to a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost—the release of cerulean regret into the sky—under an accumulative/textural lens. The compass and lace pattern create a persistent constraint that shapes tactics, and orientation is clear early. Causality is tight, with each knot in the ritual escalating toward redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: storm → entry → collection → extended observation → subtle environmental changes → conceptual realization, with clean causal or implied-causal flow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of reality’s “tiny disturbances,” with the butterfly dust and greenhouse jointly reweighted at the end. However, the pressure curve is gentle and there’s little sense of a live alternative path or serious risk; her success feels almost inevitable once she begins observing. The result is structurally sound and thematically tidy but not sharply consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain from arson → ledger discovery → canyon journey → mine → new kiln is clean, and the story lands a legible closure where Elya recommits to her art with a reweighted worldview. The drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with imagery and motifs building rather than reversals. However, the middle has little structural complication or uncertainty; each step works on the first try, so pressure never truly tightens. The cost of the fire remains mostly in summary instead of being reactivated structurally in later choices.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from preparation to activation of the device to communal aftermath, with no orientation issues. Causality is straightforward—her vow and the retrieved fork lead to the invention and then the conservatory’s transformation—and the closure beat (ongoing chorus of survivors) lands as a clear reconfiguration. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than dramatized, but the before/after of dead clock vs. singing glass is legible. No major set-ups are abandoned, though the “after noise becomes impossible” premise could bear more structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: arrival with the package → installation/assembly of the lens → activation and response of the spirits → Marlow’s departure/merging. Causality holds—each step of handling the lens understandably leads to the library’s transformation and the spirits’ settling. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the library shifts from tomb to sanctuary, and Marlow’s role reconfigures from bearer-of-bodies to part of the guiding light, with a quiet but legible cost. The structure is simple but coherent, with no major orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is linear and coherent, with sanctions → plan → first month’s success → reaffirmation of hope forming a clear accumulative arc. Causality is mostly summarized rather than dramatized—border patrols and danger are invoked but never enter the scene, so the “test” remains conceptual. Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s ongoing ringing reframes their isolation as a self-made lifeline, but it doesn’t decisively alter options on the page. The lack of a concrete turning point or tested constraint keeps this below publish-ready strength.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: discover the tear, use the camera/breath to access the reservoir, transform it, and release its power through the viaduct, all in one sustained scene. Causality under a Hybrid/accumulative lens is coherent—the breathing and alignment produce the map and tunnel, which in turn enable the healing flood. Closure lands via a conceptual/experiential shift (unused love converted into active compassion) but the cost is lightly sketched, making the before/after more beautiful than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural arc: Mara prepares the maze, a wanderer enters, the photographs disintegrate into threads, and the maze “completes” as a conduit for time. Causality is soft but legible—garden + halo fragment + photographs + visitor → maze that loops past/future—and the final state is clearly distinct from the opening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze is finished and redefined as a tactile experience of time, with the loss of the photographs as conceptual cost. However, there is no strong structural tightening; beats feel like successive embellishments rather than a pointed progression toward an unavoidable turn.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Mara enters the carnival, decodes the piano bench, descends, uses the arrow to open the vault, retrieves seeds, and plants them, producing a clear before/after with cost and gain. Closure lands solidly with the shoot breaking through dry soil and the wall falling, a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration. The main weakness is that some set-ups feel underused or conveniently resolved—the “guardians” who will impede intruders never appear, and the puzzle succumbs quickly once the lullaby connection is recalled. Still, for this length, the structure holds under a causal lens and does not lose orientation or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: Mara arrives with a goal, performs the forging/imprinting, and leaves with the completed device and a reweighted understanding. Causality is soft but present (collect absences → forge lullaby → device that encodes broken trust); there are no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard’s memory and her own are synced. The cost is subtle—she carries the weight of collected grief—but readable.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clean causal chain—mission → flower-code lock → map → hidden library → lantern ignition → redefined role—with no orientation issues and a legible before/after. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of Lira’s identity and the station’s purpose, which is on the page. However, obstacles (lock, tunnels, jade door) resolve almost frictionlessly, so progression feels like a guided tour rather than a pressured sequence of choices. The cost of the final shift is gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: one scene, one POV, and a clear before/after in how the control room is held in meaning. The global drive is more textural than causal—repetition of work, narration, and imagery builds to the reconfigured final image of the room as “cradle for hopeful inquiry.” Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is present and legible, with the bookmark and glassware pattern paid off. What’s missing is a sharper structural tightening—no single turn or interruption forces a new tactic or deepens the stakes beyond restatement.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: discover shell → decode cast → find lever → reveal vial → choose to pay the price, leading to a clear before/after transformation. The closure is legible as a Decisive Change: she accepts the cost and exits the library reconfigured, with a new relationship to fear. However, the supposed catastrophic mechanism (collapse of the aisle) resolves with minimal friction, and there’s little sense that failure was a live possibility. Structural focus remains tight in a single scene, but the cost of the final choice is more told than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: storm → star’s appearance → mapping ritual → sealing the map → dawn and dissolution, all under a single continuous scene. Causality works cleanly within the chosen mystical logic (wind stirs pages, silence reveals symbols, breath seals the map), and there is a clear closure beat when the map dissolves into the air. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—the guide he labors to create must cease to exist as an object—yet it’s legible on the page. The drive lens holds as accumulative/textural throughout, with no orientation problems.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: procedure → courtyard → violin experiment → data-recording → return to work, all in one coherent scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat builds toward the closure realization that cleaning and thinking have fused. Causality is soft but consistent—nothing breaks logic, and the final stance flows from prior actions. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than situational, which limits impact but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: doodles → lens → theater apparatus → public projection → new civic norm. Closure is present as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the town’s mistrust is thawed and the forecourt becomes a ritual site—but the change feels almost frictionless, with no meaningful obstacle or risk to earning that transformation. Causality holds, yet the stakes are resolved more by concept than by dramatized pressure, which keeps this below immediate top-tier publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative progression: discover marbles → polish them → maze responds → oak remembers the pact → clearing and fountain as closure. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens, with each polishing pass linked to deeper access and acknowledgment from the garden. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship between gardener and maze is formally reaffirmed, and the pact is conceptually repaired. What’s missing for a higher score is a more pressured turn where the outcome feels uncertain or the cost of failure is dramatized rather than assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: station → lever → experiment → result → reflective coda, all causally coherent under a textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the world’s rules are confirmed (time can “move sideways”) and the station is subtly re-seen as a living organism. Still, the lack of meaningful obstacle or consequence mutes the sense of a before/after with cost; everything largely goes as planned. The repetition of “magnetic nexus at twilight” and the return to birds and flora does provide a clear, if gentle, structural cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: water damage → pattern recognition → legend recall → code realization → performance that unlocks the aria and calms the house. Causality is clean under a quasi-mystical rule-set and the closure—ghost freed, program dried, storm receding—lands clearly on the page. The decisive change is more conceptual and atmospheric than plot-heavy, with limited sense of risk or alternative outcomes. Still, for a quiet lyric piece, the build and closure are well-shaped and satisfy the defined drive.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the fever break → ritual with illustration and instruments → barometer reading → aurora-deck coda creates a clear before/after in her stance toward the lie. Causality within the speculative logic (smudging introduces patterns; barometer adjustment yields a measurable “weight”) holds well enough for the mode, and closure as a Conceptual Repricing/RR (“carry the weight outward rather than inward”) lands on the page. However, the middle lacks a pronounced tightening or complication—her process succeeds without real resistance or possibility of failure, so the arc risks feeling pre-ordained. The fever backstory is integrated cleanly and doesn’t disrupt orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: Mara enters the tunnel with a goal, examines the wheel via radio-fragment “data,” reaches an understanding of the truth’s weight, and then chooses to leave it—an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure. Causality is internally consistent, and the pattern of confession → rumor → appraisal → renunciation is legible. However, escalation is gentle and mostly abstract; the cost of the decision is implied rather than sharply crystallized in a final constraining image. The drive lens (accumulative) holds, but the closure could tighten around a clearer before/after inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: library → decision → descent → refuge → return, with a clear before/after in his relation to silence. Causality works in a soft, lyric way (he hears the river, follows the map, reaches the refuge, is altered), and orientation is solid from early on. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the keeper’s stance toward his task is quieted and reweighted, with time briefly loosening and then resettling. The cost of this shift (self-dissolution, centuries washed) is only lightly implied, which softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: eclipse approaches, music ritual occurs, then a brief mythic epilogue shows its aftermath, all under one continuous causal arc. The drive is largely accumulative/textural; pressure builds as the eclipse nears and releases in the communal experience with a resonant reconfiguration when the valley’s culture changes. Closure is present and legible—Sage Ridge’s future behavior is reweighted by this event—but the cost is soft, mostly implied as Liora’s ongoing responsibility rather than a sharp foreclosing of options. Nothing crucial is confusing or undercut by plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: tapestry → diaries → hum → descent → chamber → activation forms a clear investigative through-line. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the axis is “not a fracture but a realignment” and the silo “breathes,” reweighting prior detail. Causality is intact, but stakes and price remain abstract, so the final turn doesn’t quite bite in terms of consequence. The orientation (who/where/what he’s doing) is clear throughout, with no structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: specs → realization → implementation → first visitor → global ripple, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the lighthouse as a beacon of “open mysteries.” Causality is soft but legible, with no major orientation issues. However, the arc lacks a true on-page test or disruption; events feel like a smooth exposition of an idea rather than a story under pressure, and the “revolution” is largely summarized. Closure exists but with minimal felt cost or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal throughline—ritual preparation → deepening loop → climax at the anchor → city saved—is legible and clean, with no orientation issues. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with an accumulative/lyric bias, and closure lands as a Decisive Change (anchor stabilized, possession waning) with a light conceptual cost. However, the “clock of possession” and possible soul-consumption are largely asserted rather than tested in on-page complications, so options never feel truly narrowed. The climax resolves smoothly without a concrete reversal or visible sacrifice that would sharpen before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece works as an accumulative, lyric scene: each beat (shell alignment, whispered fortune, glass resonance, lake transformation) escalates toward a clear resonant reconfiguration where homesickness becomes compass and she steps into the conductor role. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when are quickly clear), and there are no causality breaks. Closure lands on the page: the final glass cookie and released fortune concretize her new stance. The cost is relatively soft and conceptual, but legible in the relinquishing of pure nostalgia for an oriented future-facing role.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure holds: he steps onto the viaduct, engages with the tablet/algorithm, deepens into the inner labyrinth, and reaches a reconfiguring closure as the tablet dissolves and he becomes “periodically eternal.” Causality is more metaphorical than concrete, but consistent—the algorithm and glowing arches respond to his resolve, and the ending’s shift in state is legible. The drive lens feels steadily accumulative rather than causally tight, but that’s taught early and maintained. Cost at closure is conceptual (absorbing all fractured selves) rather than dramatized, keeping this just short of elite-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: Marin enters with a purpose, attempts a ritual with the backward songs, then escalates by forcing them forward, resulting in a clear before/after shift in her emotional state. Causality is coherent and accumulative under a textural lens, with each move (needle on turntable, reversed then forward play) deepening the central experiment rather than meandering. Closure is on the page—her numbness rewired into ongoing practice and a reconfigured cavern—though the price she pays is more implied effort than sharply dramatized sacrifice. The brief telescoped epilogue about future visitors and seasons extends the arc without derailing it.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and linear: courtyard arrival → recognition of quarantine constraint → lateral solution with the shaft → quiet closure in renewed resolve. Causality holds, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration where she recommits to her role under new constraints. The “being followed home” beat is never cashed out into actual pressure or choice, which makes it feel like a dropped setup. Cost at the end is more conceptual than dramatized, keeping this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: Arlen enters with a long-standing question, applies a newly obtained vial under UV light, experiences layered memories, and exits with a reconfigured stance toward grief. Causality holds cleanly—each move (obtaining vial, uncorking it, observing the revealed memories) flows into the next realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: grief is reframed as something that can be studied and transformed into “a lantern of understanding,” with the cost of feeling all that sorrow on the page. The piece avoids disorientation; who/where/when are anchored early and remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure reads as accumulative/textural: successive choices and discoveries (patterning light and rope, uncovering layers, following tunnels) build toward the culminating fork. Causality is soft but coherent: his actions with the rope and walls lead to the revelation of tunnels, which in turn present increasingly charged options, ending in the decisive bind-or-release choice. Closure is clear and on-page—he binds the rope, accepting a particular configuration of past/future—and carries a conceptual cost (sealing the escaped soul’s echo). The main limitation is that several “impossible choices” are gestured at but not dramatized into distinct turns, so escalation feels more declared than structurally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival at the greenhouse, gathering at the bonfire, elder’s tale, violin performance, orchard response, and echoing ship hulls all build toward a reconfigured hush. Causality is soft but legible—her playing influences the bowl, the vines, and the communal mood. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the hush becomes a charged space “waiting to be filled” and the world’s decay is reframed as graceful and ongoing. The missing element is cost; nothing truly resists her or threatens failure, so the before/after line is more conceptual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one primary ritual in the grotto, followed by a brief coda in the city that extends the pattern and delivers closure as a recommitment to her trade. Causality is coherent—each step of the process flows into the next, and the courier’s crate naturally sets up the next iteration. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: we end with a charged poise around Mara’s ongoing choice to turn grief into product. The cost, though conceptually present, is understated and never quite bites on the page, keeping the impact short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: misdelivered envelope → visit to lighthouse → understanding the locket’s meaning → community ceremony and register. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with a soft but coherent build toward a communal reconfiguration rather than a sharp turn. Closure is present—a conceptual repricing around compassion and story-as-cargo—but the resolution is almost frictionless, with no real obstacle testing that drive. As a result, the structure feels more like a lyrical sequence than a fully pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → communal search → vow and tapestry → later reconfiguration via Lira’s discovery, with a clear before/after in how the tag is understood. Causality is soft but coherent—Arlen’s invitation leads to the ritual, which reframes the arbor and enables the later conceptual shift that the tag is “a living symbol.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, with the orchard’s ache softening into a glow once the community begins to heal. The main limitation is that stakes and obstacles remain low-friction, so the turns feel gentle rather than genuinely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean causal arc—rumor → quest → canal traversal → pendant activation → descent → citywide reconfiguration—with an accumulative, lyric texture. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing: time and echo are redefined, and the city’s interrupted heartbeat is restored at the cost of the pendant. However, obstacles are minimal and every step works on the first try, which keeps the drive feeling more ceremonial than pressured. The “giant’s nap” and rooftop canal rules are coherent enough, but they rarely generate tactical constraints that complicate the path.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative ritual: enter orchard → use stone and eyes → receive numeric “equation” → re-translate it into petals and return vision to the trees → depart. Causality is soft but coherent, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of loss rather than a decisive act. The cost is implied (he must accept loss as transformation and leave, not restore fully), but it’s quiet and largely conceptual. Still, the before/after in understanding is legible and the scene resolves under its chosen logic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: exit crawl space → library search → pipe chase → basement completion → emergence as guide, with clear causal steps. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Maren becomes visible and the library “breathes a sigh of relief.” However, the outage and urgency are largely atmospheric rather than structurally constraining, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed at the end. The drive reads as hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural bias, executed competently but not sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: observe anomalous leaf → create microclimate → mycelial contact → gradual green → institutionalize the lesson in a greenhouse. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Marlowe’s practice is reframed around “releasing control”—but the cost is mostly conceptual, with little sense that a viable alternative has been genuinely abandoned. Causality is soft but legible, and orientation is clean from the opening. The late “weeks that followed” time jump functions, but it slightly diffuses the earlier laboratory-like focus and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: rain trail → brooch discovery → mystical offer → ritual → convergence → aftermath in the studio. The piece delivers closure via a decisive exchange that changes the island’s state and Mara’s relationship to her art, with a coherent before/after. The “voice” in the brooch and the mechanics of the exchange arrive conveniently, with minimal friction or doubt, softening the sense of real cost. Still, as an accumulative-causal hybrid, the structure is legible and satisfies the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: pilgrim arrives, pearl activates, unseen forces reconfigure the cave’s “bright darkness,” then a child’s arrival and the pilgrim’s return seal the new order. Causality is soft but coherent—each beat grows from the previous one through the cave’s response, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear early. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: unpredictability and unseen forces are reweighted from vague threat to guiding promise. The cost is subtle but present in Lira’s acceptance that the future remains unseen yet binding; stakes don’t deepen much beyond that, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the pattern of sounding the valve, gathering fragments, and building a communal narrative is established and then reweighted when he’s called to sea. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—his role expands from solitary archivist of the harbor to connector of “scattered songs of the sea”—but the cost of that expansion is only lightly implied. Causality within the lyrical frame is sound, with no confusing jumps or broken rules. The late shift onto the sloop is graceful but slightly summary-like, muting the impact of the transition from stasis to journey.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal thread (clue → arrows → doorway → vault → staircase → door → ledger → new role) is coherent and cleanly sequenced, with no orientation issues. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the “fortress” is redefined as a living archive, shifting what her quest means. Cost is more implied duty than dramatized sacrifice, which keeps this from higher bands. Structure is solid and satisfying, but the journey is unusually frictionless for elite-market stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is essentially one continuous ritual scene—discover tile, activate it, transcribe, then rehouse it—working under an accumulative, textural drive. Causality is coherent (tile responds to thoughts and whale-song-like memory; transcription yields peace and a new purpose for the space), and closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration is legible when she defines the tower as ongoing sanctuary. Stakes and turns, however, are very soft; nothing seriously threatens failure or misstep, so tension feels more like a smooth meditation than a pressured progression. That softness constrains structural impact at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: boredom → whispering to stone → storm/amulet arrival → spatial rearrangement → confrontation with “reflection” → conceptual shift and departure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “goodbye” is redefined and he abandons his prior stasis at some implied cost. That said, the pressure never tightens into a hard choice—the piece feels more like a guided vision than a problem he must solve, which keeps escalation and cost moderate rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean single-scene structure: Mara waits, grief accumulates, the breach occurs, the ink writes a contract, and consequences ripple outward, ending in a conceptual reconfiguration of asylum. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—the pressure of grief and waiting enables the breach, which enables the contract, which reweights asylum. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing rather than a decisive on-page event, and the cost is more abstract than felt, since the officials’ transformation is summarized rather than confronted. Stakes of failure (what happens if the ink doesn’t work or the officials reject her) are underdeveloped, softening the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens, tracking a cycle from pre-dawn through dawn and into night, with his ongoing practice as the throughline. Orientation is clear enough early: mountaintop bonsai labyrinth, silent town below, solitary hut with lamp, and one focal character. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—reframing “invented histories” as bridges that will eventually underpin the town’s voice—but the cost and before/after distinction stay fairly gentle. Structurally it’s coherent and earned, yet too static and low-pressure for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative/textural and holds consistently: the walk through the port, the discovery and activation of the label, the murals, then the closing mission statement. Causality is clean within the chosen mode—the label’s glow leads him deeper, to numbers, to murals, to realization—with no confusing jumps. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing where his status as “dead” becomes a necessary condition for becoming a living archive. Stakes remain mostly conceptual; there’s little sense of what’s threatened if he failed or walked away, which keeps this shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is essentially a single accumulative scene: observatory → shell on cello → hums → ledger → realization, which is coherent and easy to follow. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each magical and reflective beat thickens the same question until the conceptual repricing at the end (“the riddle was not a puzzle to solve but a reminder…”). Causality is soft but functional: her actions cause discoveries, though nothing meaningfully constrains her or threatens failure. Closure lands conceptually, but cost is gentle and the path there feels smooth, with little sense of sharpened options.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the chip leads to decoding the map, to graffiti messages, to reorganization, to the council’s reaction and postponed privatization. Structure is linear and coherent with no orientation issues, and closure lands in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city’s stance toward privatization has changed with an acknowledged ongoing cost. The main limitation is that many critical turns (building the network, community uptake, investors’ ignorance) are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts impact. Still, the before/after is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation and structure are extremely clear: single POV, a single ascent and ritual on the summit, with clean causal links (chemical timer → shutter → photograph → emotional aftermath). The piece uses an accumulative drive, deepening the meaning of the sand grain and the act of photographing it rather than relying on big reversals. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he completes the mission, secures the canister, and reframes the act as an “offering” and a “captured breath of time,” with visible emotional cost. The limitation, for elite venues, is that the central problem is solved exactly as planned, with no challenge to tactics or expectation that would stress the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene framed by the ship’s anchor rising, with the causal thread of diagnosing and repairing the wing leading to a quiet but legible closure. The inferred lens is largely Accumulative/Textural, with setting and process deepening rather than sharp reversals; this holds consistently through the end. Closure lands in Mara’s settled assurance and renewed planning, a modest Resonant Reconfiguration where “each repaired wing was a promise” reweights prior detail. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, and the stakes never quite tighten into a truly pressured decision, which keeps it out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: discovery of the phrasebook pattern → decoding via heated glass → decision to transmit → environmental response (bell toll, thaw vein), all within one coherent window. The closure is a Charged Poise/RR: the first glint of flowing water and the sent signal reconfigure the situation from watchful stasis to impending change with implied cost and wider consequences. Some turns (the transmitter still working, the bell spontaneously tolling) lean on mythic convenience rather than tested effort, but they fit the fable-like mode and don’t break the lens. The causal through-line—her actions catalyzing a broadcast and coinciding with the thaw—remains legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric mode: he waits → sunrise hits archway → fork hums → town rebuilds → people arrive → he leaves. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph and the magical logic, while not detailed, is internally consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town has moved from ruin to revival and the tuner’s work is complete. The main weakness is the lack of a meaningful on-page price for this success, which keeps the ending from feeling fully earned at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal throughline—rumor → descent to temple → activation of vial → price of giving up the distress signal → resurfacing with changed purpose—is coherent and lands in a legible closure. The drive reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric component; the pattern of “gathered hush/unsnarl” is taught early and paid off. However, the decisive turn (sacrificing the beacon) arrives without much structural build-up and the supposed time/battery pressure doesn’t materially constrain later options. The ending is conceptually complete but could use sharper foregrounding of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: lattice pulses → corridor → chest/map → reef → bodies → return, with a legible before/after shift from ignored warner to guiding light. The structure is linear and clear despite the lyricism, and closure lands via a reconfiguration of his role and the lighthouse’s meaning. However, the stakes around the bodies and any real danger to the boy are underdeveloped; nothing resists him, so many beats feel like preordained procession rather than pressured turns. The cost of success is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: repeated passes through the greenhouse build toward the decisive act where she infuses the soil and disappears, leaving the bead as an on-page closure object. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each visit awakens more of the orchard until a threshold is reached. Stakes and costs are somewhat abstract (kingdom, lifetimes, “fractured cycles of time”), but the before/after (dead frost vs. glowing blossoms; bound ghost vs. bead relic) is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: repeated night-walks, sewing, and plate transformations build toward the reconfigured labyrinth and the guildmasters’ capitulation. Causality is soft but legible—her continued weaving leads to the crumbling of precedents and the labyrinth’s new function. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, but the cost is underdeveloped; rule-breaking is mentioned, not dramatically contested. The piece sustains its pattern and resolves coherently, yet the lack of concrete obstacles keeps it from feeling structurally tight at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.6)
    The structure is straightforward: a single throughline from entering the orchard to completing the altar, with the magical activation as closure. Causality holds—each step of excavation and assembly leads to the chime and ancestral voice—but the path is almost frictionless, with no true setback or hard choice. The drive feels predominantly accumulative/textural, and the ending does deliver a clear resonant reconfiguration (altar restored, faith renewed). Because the cost of success never feels pressured on the page, the closure is satisfying but modest in impact.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: ritual preparation → activation → dispatch of the letter. Causality is coherent at the symbolic level (chalk → code → address → drone), and the closure (the letter leaving as “encoded hope”) is legible as a conceptual repricing of surface mail. However, stakes and costs are never concretely tested, so the structural arc reads more like an extended vignette than a fully pressured story beat. Orientation is strong from the outset, with no temporal or spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: observatory → candle delivery → decoding via stitching → completed chart sent out, yielding a Charged Poise closure. Causality within the magical logic (“each stitch marked a hypothesis… the rhythm revealed which rumor held weight”) is stable enough, though somewhat summarized rather than dramatized in specific tests or setbacks. The coup remains off-page, so the decisive external outcome is deferred, but the narrative still lands on a clear before/after in knowledge and action (city ignorant vs chart in circulation). Cost is modest but legible in the ember’s exhaustion and her relinquishing the chart instead of hoarding power.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: entering the labyrinth → first glass pane attempt → spirits weaving the apology into roots → second, lagoon-scale ritual → release. Causality is soft but legible—placing the shard under moonlight generates condensation, which permits the apology to manifest and then disperse into the environment. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the apology becomes ambient rather than delivered, and her burden lifts with a discernible before/after. Stakes and sequence are never confusing, though the turns are gentle rather than sharply escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: translator called to task → anesthetic window of reading and ritual → quiet closure as the child wakes and meaning is “sealed.” Causality is simple but intact, and the closure beat (droplet on the cast, walking away with ache) provides a legible before/after shift in resonance. However, the stakes and costs are mostly conceptual, and no on-page decision truly narrows options or forces a trade-off. The structure is elegant but low-tension, more tableau than story by top-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural lyric: she awakens, connects to the network, creates the mural, witnesses its effect, and leaves in a charged new stance. Causality is straightforward and coherent, with no orientation confusion, and the closure (the orchard’s rebirth and her recognition of art’s power) lands as a Conceptual Repricing. However, the “before/after” lacks teeth because no on-page obstacle or price threatens her goal. The ending is resonant in tone but not costly, which keeps this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: Lena arrives, tests the garden with the coin, experiences increasingly intense sensory/inner responses, and exits with a reconfigured stance. Causality is soft but legible—echo → bells → auroras → nested awakenings → conscious shift—and the closure (her conscious decision to choose curiosity, signaled by smile and laugh as she leaves) lands on the page. Time and place are anchored early and remain stable; there’s no orientation debt. The main weakness is that the stakes and cost of the shift are kept abstract, so the structural arc feels elegant but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: greenhouse → planting the seed → the night’s chant and warping → Mirabel’s choice → expansion to the city’s gardens, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing / Earned Stasis: the greenhouse becomes a “living archive of rebellion,” with Mirabel’s complicity marking a stable new state. However, escalation is largely told rather than dramatized—there’s no concrete scene where taxation pressure or discovery risk directly tightens options. The causal spine is more implied than felt, which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: centuries of observation → discovery of the postcard → ritualized creation → blossoming armistice → future child inheriting the song. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—pain becomes a stable, luminous archive with intergenerational continuation—under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is soft but legible (postcard arrival and response), and there’s a clear before/after in the shell’s purpose. The main limitation is that the emotional cost of the long buildup is more declared than dramatized in discrete turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story reads as accumulative/textural: repeated ritual → crystallized variation when the traveler arrives → quiet return to the cycle. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her regret is repriced into ongoing, purposeful caretaking with a cost of perpetual partial loss. Causality within the fable-logic holds, though the traveler’s arrival feels more fated than earned by prior turns. The cost is present but gentle, so the ending satisfies more as mood than as a sharp structural click.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: each decoding step deepens the archive’s reawakening, culminating in the covenant revelation and renewed dialogue. Causality is simple but clean—Elara applies her method, glyphs respond, covenant emerges, the archive and keepers react—providing a legible before/after reconfiguration. Closure is present (the archive shifts from mute breach to living covenant), yet escalation is gentle and largely unopposed, with little sense that failure was ever a live possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: examine adhesive → decode cipher → link chain to valve → building calms → council elder is moved, yielding a legible before/after. The piece achieves closure via a clear Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the system now runs on “shared empathy” and political division softens. However, most stakes (council conflict, danger to the city) stay abstract and offstage, and the process unfolds without obstacles or surprises, so structural tension is modest. Still, for a short lyric-leaning scene, the throughline is coherent and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is accumulative and coherent: discovery of the meteorite chip deepens the existing dust-mapping ritual, then extends outward through pigeons to the city, returning in a reconfigured final image. Causality at this lyric scale holds—each new layer (chip, birds, notes to vendors) grows plausibly from the last and the closure beat (map glowing after the chip fades) functions as a resonant reconfiguration. That said, the story reads as a steady unfolding rather than a shaped progression toward a decisive juncture or visible sacrifice. The cost of her transformation and the stakes of failure are conceptually present but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: contact with the code leads to chair-grain analysis, which leads to the hidden panel, glass corridor, maps, and a reconfigured understanding. Causality is soft but legible, with each move flowing from the previous discovery, and orientation is never in doubt. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the distance between wonder and understanding—linked to his return to the maze with new knowledge. The main limitation is that cost and constraint at the end are more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a largely linear, accumulative structure: Aria enters, uses the feather and fireflies, accesses deeper chambers, triggers constellations, and emerges changed. Causality is broadly intact (each magical act unlocks the next space), and orientation is clear. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the facility’s purpose shifts from observation to communion and Aria carries that new understanding to the surface, but the cost of that shift is minimal and mostly conceptual. The “until sunrise” clock is mentioned yet never materially constrains options, so structural pressure feels soft.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: seeds → colored conjectures → deeper cave → fissure → repaired bridge and conceptual realization. Structure is linear and legible, with a clear closure unit when she restores the bridge and reconceives the nature of the paths. The “before memory fades” frame is underused as active pressure, so stakes stay conceptual rather than sharpened in-scene. Still, the story reaches a proper reconfiguration: paths are not gone but conditional on emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: bishops and water → ink X → improvised song → tide erases ink → quiet exit. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: he completes one micro-ritual and recommits to his ethos before vanishing. However, the causal stakes remain low; nothing he does substantially alters his options or knowledge beyond confirming what he already believes. It reads as a well-shaped vignette rather than a story with a decisive structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: find the speck → master slipping through gaps → perform the ritual → reframe exile and release the stanza into the world. Causality is lightly sketched but coherent, and the accumulative/lyric drive holds to the end with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (exile becomes pilgrimage/bridge). The main weakness is the lack of on-page cost or credible threat that the ritual might fail, which keeps the decisive change somewhat low-stakes. Still, the closure unit is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece works as an accumulative lyric rather than a causal plot: the ritual unfolds cleanly from stone toss to interpretive reverie to quiet resolution, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, in which the world is “revalued” and Mira pockets the stone as a talisman. However, there is essentially no significant turn or narrowing of options; the initial premise (“she performs her ritual and finds meaning”) is fulfilled without real structural surprise or cost. The structure is coherent and sufficient, but too flat in tension for top-tier publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is simple but coherent: walk up ridge with box → ritual at clearing → descent to village → opening of the box and communal transformation. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated images of light, ash, and the box build toward a clear closure in the town square, where the “bargain” is reinterpreted. Causality is soft but legible—her intentional act of opening the box produces the cascade of light and thematic resolution. The main limitation is that the earlier bargain and its cost are summarized rather than structurally tested in the present, keeping the arc somewhat thin.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: experiments with balloons lead to the gauge’s reinterpretation as a mirror and then to the festival, a clear before/after conceptual shift. The drive lens is primarily Accumulative/Textural, with causal links (“Arin gathers artisans → runs trials → reinterprets gauge → proposes festival”) but escalation is mostly conceptual rather than pressured. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the gauge’s nature and the city’s path forward are reframed—but the cost of this shift is nearly frictionless. There are no orientation issues; who/where/what are clear early and stay stable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: discover diaries/film → experiment with the wall → experience the corridor’s “exhalation” → extended return visits that reweight the premise into communal legacy. Closure lands via a conceptual reconfiguration of what “mapping” means, and the beats follow logically. However, the middle lacks a strong tightening beat—events unfold in a gentle progression rather than a sharpened arc. The months-later summary at the end slightly diffuses immediacy, though it doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric single-scene structure: pattern is taught early (terrace–mirrors–heartbeat–lullabies–bells) and brought to a clear closure when the bells toll and the doors appear. Causality is soft but legible: he paints and sings, then the mirrors respond, then the bell triggers the full release. However, there is almost no on-page resistance, and no meaningful cost is attached to the transformation; the before/after is conceptually clear but emotionally easy. Structurally, it’s coherent and complete, yet low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: arrival at a charged ritual, drafting terms, public reading, and the visible decisive change of the chieftains laying swords on the altar. Causality is straightforward and coherent, with no orientation issues: the setting and stakes are quickly anchored and the closure—a successful treaty ritual—is legible and on-page. The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative, with ritual pressure culminating in a stance crystallization, and this holds consistently. The main limitation is that the path from conflict to resolution feels smooth and somewhat inevitable, with few genuine complications or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: past act (manufactured drought) → present ritual at the brine basin → brief aftermath with scientists, forming a coherent causal arc. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the world misreads his cruelty as philanthropy while the salt flat preserves the true, haunted cost. However, the central scene lacks a meaningful turn or complication; events unfold exactly as planned, so momentum relies more on description than on evolving stakes. The epilogue with scientists feels slightly summarized, but it supports the closure rather than undermining it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: courtyard entry → contact with the prism → untangling threads → release of echoes → city’s awakening → her vanishing. Causality is clear enough under a textural lens, and the closure (the world’s narrative reweighted toward rebellion) lands on the page. However, the process unfolds without real complication or setback; every step works as soon as she attempts it, softening the sense of struggle or risk. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which keeps this below true top-tier structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural single scene with embedded memory: she enters the dome, performs a ritual, receives an insight, and departs with a clarified intention. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the reflective passages stay anchored to present stimuli (the dome, the stick, the echo of the argument). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the puppet strings reimagined as lifelines, reconfiguring her practice of storytelling. The cost is subtle but present—she accepts that “ethical storytelling” means surrendering some authorial control—yet the pressure toward that shift never tightens beyond a gentle drift.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: Lira arrives with a purpose, performs the ritual during the monarch passage, and remains after sunrise in an earned, quiet closure. The before/after is legible—she moves from honoring a moment to assuming an ongoing guardianship—but the cost remains conceptual and understated. Causality within the chosen mode holds, with the migration as the ticking window that shapes the ritual’s timing. Still, the lack of a sharper turn or complication keeps the structural arc from feeling truly decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara enters with a goal, manipulates the rope, restores the song, then we see the sanctum’s new function via the traveler. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration (the sanctum becomes a “living library”), and the small time jump is legible. The main weakness is that each step proceeds without complication or reversal, so structural turns feel more like smooth progressions than pressured inflection points.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: bunker → ritual with wafer → dream-trail vision → vortex → directive rewriting → new pact. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, with the directive reconfigured and her understanding of paths deepened in a way that clearly marks a before/after. Causality is mostly metaphysical but internally consistent, though the ease with which the directive rewrites itself softens any sense of cost or hard-won change. Orientation is clear throughout, with no disruptive lens or time jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative/textural arc: discovery of the tile → research and schematics → ritual alignment → covenant manifestation → aftermath. Causality is clear enough—his actions lead to the ritual’s success—and the closure beat (violet glow, covenant sealed, subtle prosperity) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of his practice. However, stakes are largely asserted rather than tested; there is no moment where the plan might fail, or where an alternative path is even considered, which softens the sense of cost at closure. Structure is clean but a bit too smooth and unresisted for top-tier literary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara plans to use the music box during the shifting-phase to rewire the monks’ resentment, succeeds, and later extends the pattern to the wanderer. The two-shard structure (monks, then wanderer) is coherent, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sanctuary and box become a recurring global mechanism of released resentment. However, the progression is nearly frictionless—every touch produces transformation with no real setbacks or complicating turns. The drive lens feels primarily causal with accumulative overtones, and that hybrid holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → ritual → repair → dream capture → new charged equilibrium, with each step causally flowing from the last. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard and dream are now linked through the repaired sextant and mirror, and Arlen adopts an ongoing duty. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, but the before/after is legible. Nothing crucial is confusing or omitted, though the path from problem to success is relatively smooth and untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: breach → recall to orchard → ribbon snag → use of forgotten tools → idea to mend quartz → successful repair → reframed destiny. Structure is linear, contained in one scene, and closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the breach is reinterpreted as a nudge toward deeper purpose. The cost is relatively soft—no real risk of failure or meaningful alternative path is put under strain. Still, the piece feels complete and coherent under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is legible and accumulative: orchard summons → questioning → bathroom breakthroughs → revelation that the cameo is a key → activation and conceptual shift about nonlinear inheritance. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with each surreal beat adding density until the final conceptual repricing (“knowledge is a garden that grows in loops”). Causality is loose but not incoherent; the pattern of questions dissolving and later reassembling is signaled and paid off. Closure lands conceptually, though the cost of the shift is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clean: researching catalog gaps → discovering the vine cavern → negotiating with the lock/vines → accessing the library → triggering a new portal. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: the “rescue” of unlearned lessons alters the future and reframes the bookstore as a pilgrimage site. The structure is basically one continuous progression with an added coda toward the citadel of glass libraries; this extension is coherent but somewhat softens the sense of a tight terminal beat. Cost at closure remains mostly conceptual rather than felt, limiting the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is legible and clean: card → portal → ink river → collected verses → garden → ship’s reanimation → new mission. Structure is linear with one dominant drive and a clear closure unit (resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing around stories as liberating acts). What’s missing is a real sense of risk or potential failure at any stage, which blunts the felt cost of success even under an accumulative/lyric lens, but the piece is nonetheless structurally coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: paradoxical door → memory of seal and rope → descent to vault → reweaving → door’s dissolution → reflective return. Structure is tidy, with one main progression and a brief reflective frame at the end, and the closure image (frozen clock, glowing seal) is legible and earned. The main weakness is that the stakes remain abstract and relatively low; nothing pushes the structure toward real risk or loss. Still, under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, the piece lands a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: disturbance → decision to seek quiet → reading the ice → discovery of the stone → placement → transformed cavern. The piece lands a clear closure beat with the “bloom of hush” and the establishment of his ongoing guardianship, so the before/after is legible. The structure stays linear and easy to follow, with no orientation issues or lens ambiguity. The main limitation is that each step unfolds smoothly and successfully, with little sense that failure is possible or that the solution might backfire.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: nightly ritual → rekindling → travelers’ arrival → expanded mission to other towers. Closure is present in the vow to map the wider network and in the pavilion’s redefined role as a communal beacon, but the cost of that shift is largely conceptual, not dramatized. Many beats are linked by “and so” rather than by pressured turns, and the rekindling itself happens without resistance or complication. The piece reads as a textured vignette with a gentle deepening rather than a tightly driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: storm → crystal song → shadow measurements → fog/sunrise → conceptual repricing around conjecture as bridge. Causality is soft but present—each environmental beat prompts the next interpretive move, leading to a clear before/after in his stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, with a believable emotional cost in relinquishing pure nostalgia for resolved purpose. Stakes are modest but appropriate for a lyric-intellectual piece.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single accumulative scene: arrival, sensing the fortress, lighting the rag knot, the fireworks revealing the mosaic, and a resolved departure. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens—his actions gradually awaken the fortress and complete the “note in mosaic.” Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration: his wandering is reinterpreted as purposeful, the fortress “smiles,” and he vows to return. The main weakness is the low sense of jeopardy or cost; stakes never tighten so much as gently brighten.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: grotto setup → ritual with cicada and observations → dawn conversation → realization/exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she reframes foretelling as feeling intention in pauses, with a clear before/after in her understanding. However, the actual clan confrontation and its risk are mostly summarized in a few lines, and the outcome comes too easily, so the structural peak is muted. Causality is intact but light: her foreseeing doesn’t clearly change what happens, it mainly reinterprets it.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: underground life → inversion event → ascent and collection → return and reconfiguration of meaning, with no orientation confusion. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the gathering of silences and the final reweighting of “cramped space versus sky” offer a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is coherent—trellis + inversion enable the doll to work; his experience above drives the bunker’s new hum below. The main limitation is that the plot’s turns are conceptually interesting but low in concrete complication or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece functions under an accumulative/textural drive: a single transit across the river in which motifs (vial, terrace, hush) build toward a quiet resolution. Causality is simple but coherent—Lira’s methods gradually deepen, leading to the vial bursting silver and the passengers arriving calmed—and there is a legible before/after: they begin in tension, end in “a destination that was simply peace.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change; the mission is fulfilled and the vial is empty, but the cost is light and mostly conceptual. Structure is linear and clean, though the lack of a stronger on-page consequence keeps it from feeling fully earned at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: ruby flake → murals → fissure/corridor → stairway → throne, with an on-page decisive change when she claims the throne. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with one continuous drive that resolves. However, the declared deadline (“before sunrise”) and the supposed difficulty of claiming the throne never manifest as obstacles or reversals. Closure is present but the path feels frictionless, limiting dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is coherent for an accumulative/lyric piece: approach to the threshold, ritual action with the ring, threshold transformation, then crossing and aftermath. Causality is soft but legible—the rituals (knocking, linking through scars, burning bridges) lead to the threshold opening and a reconfigured sanctuary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: isolation-to-connection with an on-page cost (no retreat, ring left behind). Escalation is mild but present in the thickening imagery and in the eventual irreversible crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clear: world rule → farm/bolt setup → glitch texts urging action → choice to use the bolt → pressure chamber activation → diamonds and covenant realization. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a conceptual-repricing closure, and closure lands in the shift from personal wariness to a broader covenant about honesty, pressure, and brilliance. Cost is somewhat soft and abstract—the diamonds’ conditional existence and the weight of responsibility—rather than dramatized as a hard loss. Structure (one main scene with reflective extensions) is coherent and never disorienting.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Lian arrives to seek truth, uses the gramophone, interprets the standing waves, finds the cipher, accesses the compartment, and reads the confession, leading to a conceptual shift. Orientation is solid early on; we know who, where, and roughly when we are. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: the meaning of “dynasty ender” and of the empire’s fall is reweighted in the final paragraphs. The cost is somewhat soft—more reflective than pressured—so the structure feels solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clear: discovery of the program → activation of the panel via patterns → manifestation of scripts and trails → final merging with the orchard. Causality is soft but traceable under a textural lens, and the closure (binding himself to the orchard and possibility) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with implied cost. There are no major orientation issues: we know who, where, and the governing situation early. The main limitation is that the turns feel inevitable rather than pressured; events unfold smoothly without real resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural structure: button → dust → emergent stories → institutional recognition → renewed work, and this pattern holds cleanly to the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Amelia commits to ongoing, attentive work in the same space, now slightly reweighted by institutional acknowledgment. Causality is modest but intact, with each move (“she lifts the button,” “she presents it,” “she returns to it with a new file”) flowing logically. Stakes and costs are small-scale and interior, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: lagoon → puddle-map → hidden platform → key in transmitter → broadcast → weeks-later repercussions, with a clear two-shard structure and a conceptual-repricing/charged-poise closure. However, the “moment when plans unravel” is asserted rather than dramatized, and no serious obstacle ever threatens her success, so the central turn feels somewhat pre-smoothed. The ending, with the key’s glimmer and the lagoon’s living chart, lands coherent closure and cost framed in terms of ongoing struggle rather than immediate peril. Structurally this is solid and publishable, but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: arrive → play to dissolve the code → leave once the prophecy is hushed. Causality is straightforward but low-friction; nothing meaningfully resists his goal, so pressure never truly tightens even as images build. Closure is present—DC/RR as the prophecy unravels and he walks away under a new quiet—but the “world-ending” stakes are resolved with near-total ease. The accumulative/textural lens holds, yet the lack of concrete cost or complication keeps it below elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: rituals → first ignition → deciphered messages → discovery of the spring → final monument and pact. Causality is coherent—each magical response follows a concrete act (building monuments, prodding moss, placing the last leaf). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the pact seals, the arbor becomes sanctuary, and Lira’s role stabilizes, but the cost is soft and mostly conceptual (her individuality dissolving into the forest) rather than dramatized. Structure is clean but almost entirely free of genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: courier → compass test → tunnel → waterfall → brazier → inscription → return to workshop and new practice. The closure is a conceptual repricing where Mara reframes invention itself and commits to a new stance, and this is clearly grounded in the prior beats. Coincidence is thematically baked-in rather than a lazy fix, and the single throughline holds. The main weakness is that very little on-page resistance or consequence complicates her path, which keeps the structure from feeling fully pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival after the search party, ritual with the coin, internal reframing at the end form a tight single-scene arc. Causality is quiet but present—naming the dragon opens the crack, gold flows, and that physical repair triggers her emotional revaluation. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration where regret is reweighted into purposeful gratitude, with the disbanded search party as emotional cost. The main ceiling is the relatively low sense of jeopardy or consequence if the process failed; the drive lens is accumulative rather than sharply causal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: rumors → waiting at dawn → harp’s notes → tooth as conduit → confessions → laughter as experiment → gorge’s transformation and lingering hum. The story holds a coherent accumulative/textural lens, building pressure by layering sensory and emotional detail toward a single reconfiguration. Closure is solid—the world and Mara’s understanding shift, with a clear before/after, though the stakes remain mostly conceptual and low-friction. No serious orientation or logic issues, but escalation feels gentle rather than truly testing limits.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece functions as a single accumulative passage through the forest, with a clear before/after: entering in bruised survival mode and leaving with a reconfigured understanding of mercy. The causal chain is simple but coherent: endure light/trauma → decode patterns → articulate equation → emerge changed. Closure lands cleanly as a conceptual repricing, with the strap and forest reweighted. The main limitation is that the “mathematics” realization arrives slightly lecture-like rather than as a sharply dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: market → search in paintings → chain unfastens → fragment dissolves → reflective coda. Causality is legible (reading the paintings leads to the chain’s release), and the closure offers a resonant reconfiguration where the lighthouse’s memory diffuses into the city. However, the stakes remain mostly conceptual, and the “cost” of success is gentle and abstract rather than sharply felt. The reflective apartment and balcony ending ties back but doesn’t significantly re-tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: fissures → barrel light → dust analysis → ladder → attic hatch → hidden clock/barrel → mapped beams → ledger. The piece delivers a solid Resonant Reconfiguration closure, with Mara’s stance toward her burden and the ghosts reweighted by the discovery. Structure is linear, single-POV, and well-contained within the night’s investigation. The main limitation is that every obstacle yields quickly, so turns feel more like steps in a process than pressured structural pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: bottle arrives → whisper merged with ink → rupture → reconfiguration into a “living lattice,” with a clear before/after. Causality under the textural lens holds: each intensification of the whisper/press interaction leads to a larger systemic shift. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “perfect systems” and the library itself, but the cost of that rupture is underdeveloped—no real sense that Mara risks or loses anything she values. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/what is quickly clear), and the pattern stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: dispute → plan → storm-ritual → communal transformation → quiet coda, all under a single POV. Causality within the lyric frame is intact, and the closure—a shift from armed revolution to myth-making, sealed by Lira pocketing the shard—lands clearly with felt cost in memory rather than on-page sacrifice. The resolution is somewhat frictionless, with little resistance once the ritual begins, which modestly blunts structural tension but doesn’t damage closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: summoned → enters tower → applies philosopher’s stone and ancestral method → chamber heals → village responds in the coda. The closure is a clear Decisive Change from threatening song to restored harmony, with a related social reconfiguration as the town’s resonance powers the lanterns. The cost is modest (Alder’s effort and ongoing responsibility), but the before/after is legible and satisfying. The piece stays within one main throughline without tangles or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: compass → quarry → tunnel → lagoon → staircase → crystal → vortex → repriced understanding. The piece holds a mostly accumulative/textural lens, but the concrete sequence of discoveries still tracks causally and supports the final conceptual turn. Closure is present and satisfying—Mara returns to the surface with a reconfigured relationship to her quest—though the cost is largely conceptual rather than dramatized through loss or foreclosed opportunity. Structural choices fit the length and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: the archway, lantern, turbines, and driftwood recur in a tightening pattern that culminates in Mira’s reconfiguration of her practice and the arch itself. Causality is soft but coherent—lantern → visions → artistic decision → exhibition—without obvious breaks or unkept setups. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the arch and her sculptures become a way of seeing and bridging time, with the lantern dimming as an earned cadence. The cost is subtle but legible: she accepts an endless, demanding learning process rather than a tidy endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—pavilion → cathedral → stained glass → vision → return—reads cleanly, and closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration of her question about night-blooming flowers. The postcards functioning as a key to the hidden lenses gives the central event a legible causal mechanism within the piece’s lyric logic. That said, the path is almost obstacle-free; every step works on first try, so escalation and cost are muted. Still, the before/after is clear and the story resolves under its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: letters → parley → sand-symbols → lagoon → crystal → broadcast. Closure lands cleanly with a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing as the desert itself responds to the released testimony. However, each step unfolds with near-frictionless success, so structural pressure is more quest-like than truly tested. The retrocognitive diary rule is intriguing but doesn’t materially complicate the sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: cove → bottle → question → released sigh → mental reconstruction → visible revival → departure. Causality holds in a mythic/lyric sense, with the question-opening and memory-work leading to the town’s slow relighting. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the empty bottle and self-sustaining town mark a before/after shift, with his role moving from lone savior to periodic caretaker. The weakness is that obstacles never materially threaten failure, so the arc reads smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clear and cohesive: arrival in the orchard, encounter with the phonograph, accidental prophecy, reinterpretation, then inscription and quiet release. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from sensory immersion to conceptual loop is legible and the closure—a conceptual repricing of prophecy as archival design—lands. That said, the causal stakes are soft: no real dilemma or external consequence complicates the revelation, so the decisive change is thematic more than dramatic. The global drive holds, but the ending’s cost is more implied than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric mode: summoned → ritual with the acorn cap → vortex/phoenix transformation → aftermath and new seed planted. The closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration: Mira’s perception of time shifts and the covenant is re-opened with a concrete act, leaving a clear before/after. Stakes and costs remain somewhat abstract (no real possibility that the ritual fails or harms her), so the sense of risk is low even as the pattern completes. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph and the accumulative drive lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: install sensor → wait for glue to dry → reattach cable → zero hour storm pattern → bell responds differently → dawn closure with new practice established. The piece lands a valid closure via conceptual repricing/earned stasis: the sanctuary has shifted from clamor to listening, and his role has crystallized. However, escalation is gentle and risk-light, with no real chance of failure or reversal, so the structural arc feels more contemplative than compelling. For a prestigious venue, the stakes and cost at the turn are underpowered.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric structure where small actions (tracing paths, vowing, sensing the tremor) gradually deepen the central stance rather than drive a causal plot. Orientation is clear early, and the piece coherently builds from description to vow to resonant closing image. Closure arrives via a resonant reconfiguration: dawn “within the janitor’s heart” and a clarified purpose tied to empathizing with stars. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, not dramatized, but it is legible within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: repeated visits to the box and the ghosts’ presence build toward the final sealing of the covenant. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he consciously accepts his role as guardian, the box sheds amber, and the wasteland subtly “softens.” Causality is light but serviceable: recognition of the covenant leads to renewed commitment, yet the stakes remain somewhat abstract, with little on-page testing of alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Mara tends relics, learns the capsule’s history, uses the garage-sale cipher, locates the hourglass, reunites it with the fragment, and triggers the revelation. Orientation is strong from the first line—who, where, and what she’s doing are quickly legible—and the accumulative logic of the time motifs holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: clocks now count the “weight of decisions,” and the silo’s role is redefined. The main weakness is that the declared deadline (“before the last grain of sand slipped”) never materially constrains tactics, so cost at closure is more thematic than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure reads as accumulative/lyric: repeated cycles of observing discord, offering verse/ritual, and the lagoon’s response build toward a conceptual repricing of “incomplete” beauty. Causality is soft but coherent (finds feather → chooses to tend → lagoon reconfigures), and the closure image of the glowing feather/star offers a legible before/after in tone and understanding. However, progression is more circular than tightening, with several nearly interchangeable beats of harmonizing wind and water. The cost of this transformation remains abstract, keeping the closure from fully landing at a higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows a mostly linear causal arc—from decree, to project, to cultural change—with a clear before/after when the council lifts time limits. However, much of the middle is summarized (“Soon the orchard became a pilgrimage site”), flattening beat-to-beat pressure. Closure lands conceptually, but the cost of the transformation feels low and the council’s reversal comes without on-page resistance. The drive lens reads primarily accumulative/textural, but escalation under that lens could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly one accumulating scene: arrival, experiment with amber, signal resonance, then realization and naming of the Convergence. Causality is mostly sound—Arin applies the amber, the tower echoes, the convergence occurs—under an accumulative/textural lens with a clear before/after in his understanding of “home.” Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, and the cost is subtle but legible in his acceptance that home is pattern, not place. Stakes and the mechanics of the alien response remain hazy, so the climax feels more like an aesthetic intensification than a sharp turn in options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: arrival → listening/decoding → releasing seeds → immediate sprouting → reflective departure. Causality is stable under a textural lens and orientation is clear from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he leaves with a lighter burden, the jetty transformed into a charged promise), though cost is more conceptual than felt. The main limitation is the lack of any structural complication or tightening beyond a single, smooth ritual pass.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: cylinder → riddle → chest → leaf → reconfigured purpose, with no orientation issues and a coherent accumulative drive. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Rook shifts from body-finder to keeper of connections, and the final image of the settlement “breathing” underlines that. Cost is present but subtle—the taking on of a psychic burden and a vow of ongoing labor rather than a sharp sacrifice. The structure is solidly publishable, though the near-effortless success of each step keeps the arc from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: first anniversary and glimpse, then a later anniversary with the family and a recharged ritual. Causality is legible—using the deck and compass via the family custom leads to a vision, which reconfigures the narrator’s stance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a committed choice to continue navigating by an internalized “true north,” though the cost of that stance remains more implied than dramatized. The pattern is coherent but the turns are gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: he climbs the spire, performs a ritual of chess-piece swaps, triggers the sundial’s reaction, breaks the curse, then descends to share the unlocked wonder with the village. Structure is clean—a primary scene plus a short coda—and closure is decisive (frost cracks, knowledge floods, his role redefined), but the process is almost frictionless: no setback, complication, or serious uncertainty tests him. The cost of success is conceptually framed rather than dramatized, which keeps the closure effective but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrive in gallery → establish absence (pawns) → use patterned walking → reveal scroll → reconfigure mission → exit with renewed purpose. Causality is simple but functional (her pattern triggers the compartment), and the accumulative, lyric progression is well-handled. Closure lands via a conceptual reweighting—Mira fully embracing the role of historian of small gestures with the penumbra as escort. Stakes remain largely conceptual, but the before/after of her mission is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: stone → dreams → corridor → book → realization forms a clear progression, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “home.” Causality is soft but legible—the stone’s hum opening a new corridor and the book’s sensory revelation follow the established magical logic. The ending beats (replacing the stone, the mountain’s heartbeat slowing, Lira stepping out changed) provide a distinct before/after. Stakes remain modest and largely internal, so the change, while real, doesn’t carry a strong sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: village → tapestry test → labyrinth traversal → altar realization → release of the pawn → emergence into resumed time, with clear causal links under a mostly Causal/Accumulative lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and never wavers. Closure—a Decisive Change in self-conception plus a Resonant Reconfiguration of the world resuming time—is on the page, but the middle lacks a meaningful complication or hard choice; the labyrinth yields almost too readily. The cost of transformation is more asserted than dramatized, keeping this solid but short of top-tier rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure reads as accumulative/textural: repeated acts of refracting (art, chant, mural, sky-line) build toward the canyon’s response and the ritual’s onset. Causality is coherent—her initiation of the chant and mural leads to echoes, communal participation, and the canyon’s “forgiveness”—and the closure offers a clear before/after in atmosphere and burden. The cost is a bit abstract (acceptance of loss, a “piece of herself” offered) but still legible in the canyon’s shift from wound to resonant peace. The focus remains tight in time and place, so despite the lyric mode, orientation and closure are both secure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is coherent and essentially single-scene: she begins uncertain, undertakes a narrated ritual, repairs the statue/sea/self, and exits with a reconfigured stance. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/lyric lens: her narration → light filaments → statue mending → sea calming → inner doubts sealing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with a clear before/after in both the workshop’s state and her relationship to her own doubt. Stakes remain localized and mostly internal, but they resolve cleanly without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: cracked mirror → private promise → wrong turn into caves → seashell and key → remembered hidden chest → glowing shells → new painting that embodies the vow. Structure is basically linear with one central excursion and a clear return, and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration where his relationship to time and memory is slightly but definitively altered. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with straightforward causality underlying the lyricism, and the before/after is legible. Stakes and turns are modest rather than gripping, but there are no real causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: single scene, linear progression from preparation through ritual to result and realization, with no orientation issues. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated focus on vibration, scent, and light builds toward a charged final image of alignment between Mara and the world. Causality is soft but legible within the magical-realist frame (intent → ritual → fisherman’s turn → confirmation). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with limited on-page cost but a clear before/after in Mara’s certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: midnight calls → engine construction → signal stabilization → ships returning, all oriented around the single station and POV. Causality is soft but intact under a textural lens—the repetition of calls and soldering builds toward the closure image of reverse migration commencing. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the station’s function in the world inverts with a clear before/after and a felt cost in the “weight of every name etched into the copper coils.” The only limitation is that pressure and constraint around each step are implied rather than sharply foregrounded, which softens the sense of necessity in the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: a single causal sequence from meeting the smugglers through hiding the eye to a redefined function for the orchard, with a legible before/after. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid with a strong Accumulative/Textural component, and it holds to the end as imagery and concept build toward a Conceptual Repricing of “safety” and “truth.” However, the central turn—smugglers shifting from greed to silence and quasi-reverence—arrives quickly and with minimal resistance, softening the sense of cost. Closure is present and coherent but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure follows a clean accumulative arc: discovery of the journal → decision to investigate → reading the tide’s gaps → realization about “borrowed memories” → ritual placement of the flower and lighting the lamp. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of Marlowe’s loneliness and his role as keeper of others’ memories. Causality is soft but coherent for a lyric piece; there are no orientation problems, and the stakes (will this gesture be honored and understood?) are resolved on the page. Escalation is modest, though—the middle does not significantly tighten options so much as steadily deepen a single mood.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal chain is legible: discovery of the chip → following the ants → placing the chip → doorway → return to the shop, with a clean before/after conceptual shift about what a “map” is. The drive reads primarily as accumulative/textural with a causal spine; closure functions as a conceptual repricing rather than a decisive external change. Cost is implied (he foregoes stepping into any specific horizon) but not fully dramatized. Structure is cohesive for a single-POV lyric piece, with no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal through-line is clean: final warning → decision to seek the grotto → climb → basin/map → alcove/orb → dreams resolved and kingdom relieved. The drive lens is predominantly causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and closure is a clear Decisive Change (orb burst, dreams end, realm reconfigured). However, the journey is frictionless—no serious obstacles, reversals, or tactical adaptations, so structural beats feel somewhat pre-ordained. Cost at the end is implied more than dramatized, keeping this short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is linear and legible: assemble → perform the experiment → achieve the glow → vow to use it, with clear causal links between steps. However, there is effectively no jeopardy—success comes smoothly, with no failed attempts, reversals, or real risk to the participants. Closure exists as a resonant reconfiguration (they now carry the glow and a shared vow), but the “before/after” lacks a felt cost. The accumulative, ritualistic lens is consistent, yet dramatically quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: cabin reflection → remembered grave → lucid dream flight → waking and reinterpreting the grave → stepping outside. Causality is soft but coherent—dream and memory loops consistently feed back into the present choice to keep writing and to re-engage with the outer world. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the grave’s meaning shifts from literal death site to marker of future stories, and that reweights the earlier dread. Stakes are modest and interior, but the before/after in stance is legible and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative lyric: Lena engages the screw, synchronizes it to the water clock, and exits into a subtly reweighted world. Causality is soft but coherent (handling → alignment → “rebirth” of the screw → outside mother image), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where her anosmia is repriced as a different modality of sensing. Stakes remain small-scale and interior, with no major reversal, but for an accumulative drive the tightening via fog thinning, water rising, and sunrise is legible and satisfying. Orientation is clear from early on, so there’s no structural confusion undermining the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual that accumulates toward a clear reconfiguration: scars shift from failure to purpose. Causality within an accumulative/lyric lens is coherent—each step of the tea ceremony and use of the quill feeds into the transformation with no orientation issues. Closure is on-page and legible when the scars glow as “luminous verses,” but the path feels almost predetermined, with little sense that the ritual might fail or cost her more. This makes the before/after line emotionally real yet somewhat low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: enter archive with bottle → initiate induced currents → apology text manifests → she sends it toward Mara/orchard as the trees fall. Causality is legible within the story’s magical logic; each step follows from the previous, and the final chord plus lifted weight provide a clear resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. Stakes stay modest and interior, but the approaching felling of the orchard supplies a light situational clock. There are no major orientation or lens issues, though escalation is more atmospheric than decisively structural.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: entrance → reading/translation → spiral arbitration → map → crystal/vortex → reconstituted library. Each step follows a clear ritual logic, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing where history ends/reconfigures and she vanishes. Causality works within the mythic frame—her choices trigger each new phase, not coincidence. The cost is somewhat abstract, but the before/after (fragmented illusions vs. unified tapestry; her presence vs. disappearance) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene structure with causal flow: the watch change, the measuring ritual, the counting, and then the realization as the mechanism sighs. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of what clocks measure, tied to the final image of him walking away in sync with the rhythm he’s uncovered. The cost is subtle—mostly a reframing of purpose rather than a felt loss—but it is legible. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when are immediately clear), and the accumulative/textural drive is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clear and linear: arrival → system design/testing → storm as proof → reflective departure. Causality is intact, and the storm offers a modest tightening, but there is no real sense of options narrowing or failure genuinely threatening the farm. Closure is a conceptual reweighting (understanding letting go and connection) more than a decisive turn with cost. It works at a quiet, accumulative scale but doesn’t yet feel like a culminating beat in a high-stakes arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: coin on the carved seat → panel opens → tunnel traversal via probabilistic scrawls → emergence and theorem-writing. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and never lost, and the ending offers a clear conceptual reconfiguration (knowledge is split between library and subway, certainty and chance). The main weakness is that each step unfolds without friction or complication, so the structural turns feel more like stations on a pre-laid track than pressured choices. Closure is present and legible, but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: the booth, the loop, then the Lena call as a deepening, followed by the growing chorus and Mara’s final realization. Causality is soft but coherent—Mara’s method leads to progressively layered calls, which in turn enable the conceptual shift at the end. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: estrangement is redefined as communion and the tunnel’s isolation is reweighted. Stakes remain modest and internal, but there is a legible before/after in Mara’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions on an accumulative/lyric lens: twilight arrival → ritual writing → sea’s response → renewed promise and a charged final image. Causality is soft but coherent—his acts of writing and placement of the locket lead to the sea’s “chant” and his internal recommitment—yielding a clear Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never lost, and the cyclical structure (twilight to implied dawn return) is legible. The main limitation is that the pattern of covenant-renewal is reiterated more than it is deepened, so the sense of before/after change is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → plan → puzzle with ivy → retrieval → activation → sending the fragment onward. Structure is coherent as a single accumulating scene that lands in a conceptual reweighting (the cure as catalyzed connection). The puzzle resolves almost too smoothly, with no serious setback or alternate path, so the closure cost feels modest. Still, the before/after (fragment buried vs. fragment traveling outward through a network) is legible and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and linear: journey into the forest → following the melody and ring → contact with the stillpoint → return reconfigured. Causality is soft but legible under an accumulative/lyric lens; each described feature (ring, hums, melody) feeds the approach to the stillpoint. Closure lands via a conceptual shift—discovering the stillpoint within—though the cost is subtle and the path has no genuine risk of failure. Orientation is strong throughout; no penalties there.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    The structure is clear: a continuous scene in which the narrator decides to use the pen, rewrites the experiment’s “seeds,” stabilizes the anomaly, and reaches a new stance. Causal links (pen → hologram shift → corrected data → anomaly stabilizes → emotional repricing) are legible, and closure lands as a conceptual reweighting of what “editing history” means. However, the process unfolds with little complication or setback; once the pen is used, resolution is essentially linear and easy. The cost of the change is implied more in backstory than in any present-tense sacrifice, which blunts structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean two-shard lyric: Arlen enacts the technique; months later Lira discovers and continues it, which yields a coherent accumulative arc. Causality is soft but legible—Arlen’s act creates a changed harbor that enables Lira’s experience—and the closure reconfigures the premise from singular miracle to ongoing practice. Stakes remain conceptual and gentle, with no substantive obstacle or time pressure to tighten the frame. The ending achieves a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration but without a sharp sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—controlled blaze → scorched circle → vandalized self-portrait map → art trail → phoenix mechanism → bronze box with promise → return to portray murals—is coherent and satisfying. The piece delivers closure via a decisive change: he reorients his life from burning to preserving, and the mentor’s promise is literally recovered and then re-enacted. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative lyric overlay, and that pattern holds cleanly through the ending. Stakes remain intimate and mostly internal, but the structure supports them without gaps or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is clear: Lira’s rhythms intensify, the garden responds, memories surface, and the lab’s ethos is reconfigured, culminating in a new collaborative protocol. Causality is broadly legible—her drumming triggers the garden, which in turn affects the staff’s dreams—but key shifts (the wholesale protocol change, the lab’s moral pivot) occur in compressed summary rather than dramatized pressure. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with the world reweighted around compassionate collaboration, but the cost of abandoning “experimental treatment” is only lightly gestured at. Structure holds, yet the pivotal turn feels too frictionless for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Milo sets a challenge, performs the ritual, follows the changing map, uses the coin and key, and reaches an on-page conceptual closure. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the story maintains a coherent throughline within a single continuous scene. However, escalation is gentle and problems are solved almost as quickly as they appear, so the sense of narrowing options or rising risk is mild. The closure—his realization and the parchment’s message—lands, but with relatively low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the guardian arrives, performs a ritual with water and light, and departs once the lesson is complete, with a clear before/after in the night’s awareness. Causality is soft but legible—raising the mirror and weaving shutters produces constellations and a reconfigured night. However, there is minimal sense of cost or constraint; nothing concretely resists the guardian’s purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, but it lands a bit cheaply because success feels inevitable from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: the synchronized displays, town response, and sapling-planting build toward a conceptual repricing of “quiet” as radical. Causality is soft but legible—Mara organizes displays → neighbors gather → civic shift and mayor’s forum—without large temporal or spatial confusion. Closure lands in the line “The quiet has spoken,” which reweights the earlier motifs, but the cost of this transformation remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized. The smooth, nearly frictionless societal shift keeps the arc from feeling fully earned at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain—scrimshaw → whale call → island reveal → tower/crystal → hearts unlocked → changed world—is clear and easy to follow, with a legible before/after where the island no longer disappears and Mara returns transformed. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with lyric flourishes, and closure lands via a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration. However, most turns hinge on near-automatic success once the mythic machinery starts; Mara’s agency rarely complicates or redirects events, and obstacles are absent. Cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, so the structural arc functions but doesn’t yet feel gripping or inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single continuous scene of whittling and narration that builds toward a reconfigured hush in the farmhouse. Causality is simple but intact—Mara’s decision to carve, narrate, and leave the baton and bouquet leads to a quiet conceptual shift in what silence and legality mean here. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the hush becomes chosen rather than imposed. The main limitation is the lack of a strong mid-scene turn or concrete test of the mandate, so progression feels more like steady deepening than a decisive structural inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: he enters, engages the colonnade and chant, the environment responds, and he crosses the threshold with the world subtly altered. Causality is soft but legible under a lyric/textural lens: paraphrasing the chant leads to the colonnade’s color shift, the “crack” of old prohibitions, and the dissolution of lake/sky boundaries. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, with the tremor of certainty becoming a steady pulse that “guides all who listen,” but the cost of this change remains abstract. The piece holds its pattern, yet lacks a decisive on-page price or narrowed option set that would push it into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story reads as an accumulative/textural piece where each barter with the reed builds toward the courtyard’s full awakening and Selene’s reframed vision. Causality is coherent within the magic’s terms (arrangements → reed songs → new hues/awakenings), and the phoenix backdrop and furnace form a loose temporal-spatial frame. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: her imperfect sight becomes a generative lens, embodied in the glass garden and mural. Stakes and turns stay small and internal, so the before/after line is more conceptual than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural drive: one continuous experimental session that deepens the mind–bell ringer connection until the artificial sigh and lingering echo close the piece. Causality is clear (grid stabilizes → experiment begins → chimes through lens → neural response → ritualized continuation), and there is a legible before/after in the artificial mind’s responsiveness. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pilgrimage becomes a daily ritual of mutual awareness, not just a test, with a conceptual cost (travel reimagined as interior, artificial). However, escalation is gentle and the stakes remain mostly conceptual, so the structural impact is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative progression: stencil → cranes → silver thread → withered rose → wider dissemination of gardens → renewed practice with new coordinates. Causality is soft but coherent, and the closure (she now sets coordinates toward a new sunrise) reads as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost in the grief she has carried. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/what she’s doing). The only limitation is that turning points arrive with near-immediate success, muting any sense of risk in the process.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: she prepares, measures, listens, and reaches a quiet reconfiguration where burden becomes compass. Causality is soft but consistent (tape crossing glyphs → hum/song → realization), and the single-scene containment is clear. Closure qualifies as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost of this new stance is only lightly implied, so the before/after divide lacks sharpness. Orientation is strong from the opening; no structural confusion, just modest stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: entrance into the archive → approach to the pagoda via the no-pattern method → transformative encounter and departure, all in one continuous scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build from atmosphere and ritual into illumination and realization gives a legible closure where the world’s rules (avoiding patterns, purification) reconfigure into a new understanding. Causality is simple but intact, with no orientation problems. The cost of opening the archive’s veil (emotional upheaval, sacrifice of “safety of pattern”) is implied but not sharply dramatized, which keeps this out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: observation of footage → ritual with the stone → recharged footage → his own recording and departure. Causality is coherent and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—regret into legacy—rather than a decisive plot turn. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains stable, but escalation is gentle, with no real structural surprise or pressure spike. The cost at the end is more implied (accepting the burden of remembrance) than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene in the workshop that moves from aftermath of the con, through ritualistic reconstruction, to quiet closure. Causality is simple but coherent (betrayal → need to rebuild trust → symbolic reconstruction with objects → reattachment of tail). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s stance toward balance and trust shifts and is anchored in the final journal line. Stakes and cost remain modest and mostly internal, preventing the structure from feeling fully high-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: tower → tunnel → attic → tunnel → balcony, with each move motivated and clearly linked to the goal of decoding scars. The causal chain—moss → coffee rings → hourglass ritual → revelation—is legible and satisfying, and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard plot reversal. Stakes remain internal and relatively gentle, so the closure is more contemplative than pressured but still coherent. No serious orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the accumulative/lyric design holds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates cleanly on an accumulative/lyric lens: each move (psychometry → hidden compartment → letters-as-map → river of light) intensifies the central quest. Orientation is clear from early on (who/where/what she wants), and the through-line never wobbles. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes the carrier of unused love—at a felt conceptual cost. The only limit is that obstacles are minimal, so the progression feels inevitable rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure—ritual tracing of stars building toward a release—reads coherent and yields a clear before/after: silence vs. freed creativity. Causality within the lyric frame holds, and closure is legible when the last star falls and “freedom” lands as the final unspoken word. However, the path feels almost frictionless; there are no meaningful turns where options narrow or failure threatens, so the climax lacks bite. The return visits at the end reinforce resonance but function more as restatement than new structural development.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: legend → clock + chant → archive opens → sparks → nascent forest, forming a legible before/after. Closure lands via a Decisive Change (the clock starts ticking in reverse; renewal begins), with a conceptual cost in the reversal of time and his continued dreamlessness. Structure is linear, single-POV, and coherent throughout. The main weakness is how effortlessly the central problem resolves—no failed attempt or real complication—which softens the sense of earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: wandering → dream-translocation → engine activation → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he reframes the quest as internal reclamation and carries the gear out as a charged object—but the arc feels nearly foregone, with minimal sense of jeopardy or alternatives foreclosed. Causality is clear at the symbolic level, yet there’s no strong on-page constraint or cost to sharpen the before/after divide. Structurally it’s clean but not especially dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: waiting on the pier leads to boarding, the indirect voyage leads to the cave, the star-stamped ticket opens the chest, and the chest’s contents catalyze Mira’s inner shift. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric component; pattern and metaphor build to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure is on-page and legible: before, unused courage; after, a commitment to continued traversal with a recharged sense of self, with the prior leash-loss as the price. The main limitation is that obstacles along the way feel ceremonial rather than genuinely testing, so turns in options are relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: fortress → discoloration → bellhop’s offering → discoloration’s response → guests’ altered understanding. The causal chain is legible enough—placing the bolt leads to the staircase’s transformation and synchronized pause in nerve regeneration—but pressure remains largely conceptual, not situational. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing: safety is re-understood as a costly silence. The scene holds one continuous window and the lens stays consistent, but the felt cost at the end is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: oracle clue → search for pellet → decoding map → crown and rune → temple’s sundering → pretender exposed → exit and legend. Closure is solidly on the page with a decisive change and a clear before/after for the kingdom’s legitimacy. However, key middle beats (following cryptic book messages, traversing the library) are summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation feels somewhat pre-ordained. The drive lens reads as causal with light lyric overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: morning monitoring → nightly assembling → canyon watermark discovery → coordinate flash form a legible progression. The drive lens is largely Accumulative/Textural, with causality present but soft (the revelation emerges more from patient ritual than a decisive act). Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: past navigation and future restoration are newly linked. The cost of this realization (what it demands of them or the world) remains mostly conceptual and could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: she notices the glyph, invokes the stone, the hum spreads, engines reignite, workers return, and she adopts a new stance. Structure is linear and legible, with no orientation issues and a clear central drive from question (asking the stone) to answer (reignited rebellion and reframed meaning). Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the bay transforms from dead ruin to living sanctuary, and her understanding of meaning shifts. The main limitation is that the costs of this shift—personal or situational—remain conceptual rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the kite → decoding → ritual → sacrifice → embryo’s awakening → community reframing of destiny. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (a decisive unsealing plus a reconfiguration of what “implanted destiny” means for the village), with the memory sacrifice as concrete cost. Structure is linear and well-contained in a single scene, with legends and reconstruction context woven in without derailing orientation. The main weakness is that the foretold calamity never manifests even as a near-miss, so the risk side of the choice feels under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present action in the arboretum interleaves with memory, building toward a quiet but legible reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is excellent from the outset, and the lens (internal processing under steady environmental pressure) holds to closure. The final choice—to let stillness guide her steps and “plant her own beacon of hope”—lands as a clear Charged Poise/Earned Stasis beat with visible emotional cost. The main limitation is the relative softness of turns; escalation is more incremental than decisively staged.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the lighthouse, engagement with the tarot, literal and figurative descent, then return with a reconfigured stance. Causality under an accumulative/lyric lens holds: the choice to work with the broken cards leads to the spiral, the descent, and the vision that enables the new portrait. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he returns to the library with a redesigned portrait and a new understanding of fragmentation, with the lighthouse’s hum closing the loop. Some of the magical mechanics (cards rearranging themselves, door slamming) are taken on faith but are coherent within the symbolic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent accumulative/textural structure: Kael performs a ritual (releasing ink), experiences escalating vision (patterns, dissolution), then reaches a conceptual revaluation of time’s slowdown. Causality is stable at the conceptual level, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing with a before/after in his understanding and mission. However, the cost of that realization is mostly abstract; his partial “disappearance” is hinted but carries little concrete consequence. The drive lens is consistent, but the stakes of the closure remain more thematic than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean causal spine—Maren inserts the letter, the dormant networks awaken, the council convenes, dissent spreads—and closure lands as a reconfigured world where silence has been broken. Still, escalation feels more summarized than dramatized: major turns (realm-wide awakening, council scandal) occur at a distance rather than through concrete scene work. The closure image (library as lighthouse, snow melting) gives a conceptual before/after, but the price of that change is only gestured at through vague risk to Maren. Structure is coherent and legible, but the inciting decision is front-loaded and later beats reiterate its consequences rather than complicating them.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clear and linear: post-collapse gathering → Lira’s ritual with scrap and roses → communal reinforcement → dawn vow, with an accumulative/textural drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the community adopts her rituals (rose petals, the elder taking the scrap), but the path there lacks a distinct tightening or turn; events feel like smooth steps in one direction. Causality is soft but intact—each ritual leads to the next communal gesture. Cost is more implied than felt, focused on emotional reframing rather than a tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: he prepares the ritual, follows the garden’s cues, performs the climactic act with the spike, and then settles into a new state with the echo inside him. Causality is soft but legible within the lyric, mythic frame—the pulses lead him, the sky’s shift marks the decisive moment, the spike’s song reaches the constellations, and the echo is received. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reorients from hunting a divine echo to becoming its carrier and disseminator. The lack of concrete obstacles or reversals keeps the arc from feeling fully tested, but the throughline is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean: a call about a ledger prompts Mira’s ascent to the observatory, use of the console, and discovery of the ledger’s location, culminating in the archives opening. Closure is solid—knowledge changes, options for the city reconfigure, and there is a clear before/after in terms of secrecy versus accountability. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a conceptual flourish, and that holds consistently. A minor slip is the rosewood nib being both handed to the journalist and then “safely in her palm” as she descends, a small continuity glitch that slightly undercuts tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: discovery of the letters → integration of amber and firmware → transformation of the lab into a sanctuary. Causality is coherent and closure is clear, with the lab’s purpose reconfigured and Lyra’s guilt partially relieved—an effective Resonant Reconfiguration. Some key beats (the technical confrontation with the haunted firmware, the difficulty of the process) are skimmed rather than dramatized, softening the sense of cost. Still, the structural arc holds together cleanly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: Liora enters uneasy, discovers the tile, performs the mandala ritual, and reaches a reconfigured calm, followed by a brief epilogue with the violinist that confirms the transformation’s persistence. Causality is coherent—each beat grows logically from the last—and the emergent hush produces a legible before/after. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing rather than a decisive plot turn, but it lands. The main limitation is that pressures never become sharp enough to make the change feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: motifs (mosaic, shattered sky, Hearthsteel) build toward a conceptual repricing where mercy-as-steel becomes the city’s new foundation. Causality is soft but legible—the naming triggers light, which reconfigures sky and social ethos. The closure unit is clear and on-page: the plaza becomes a pilgrimage site and his past “dissolves” in a new order. The lack of substantial complication or reversal before that turn keeps the structure from feeling truly rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is legible and coherent: ghost → finds coin → learns its power → goes to orchard → sings to produce echoes → shopkeeper follows and closes the loop by wishing. The structure is a smooth, single arc with a clear before/after: a restless ghost at the start, an at-peace ghost and empowered mortal at the end. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration, with the coin and orchard reweighted by the shopkeeper’s involvement. Some mechanics (how he “learned” the coin’s rules) are told rather than dramatized, but they don’t break the spine.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is legible: city-wide static shock → idea recalling the telepathy pill concept → geode/LED/somatic-marker experiment → successful contact → decision to share data. The structure is essentially one accumulating scene with a reflective tilt, leading to a clear closure beat when she feels another mind and reorients her purpose. However, the stakes remain small and largely aspirational, so the before/after line lacks substantial cost. The drive lens reads mainly Accumulative/Textural with light causal scaffolding, and that’s held cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the ritual with the fossil and droplets builds toward the caves’ “heartbeat” and her final understanding. Causality within the lyric frame is coherent—her invocation of the storm, the droplets, and the leaf’s glow each follow from established rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the premise of “voice of the unknown” is reweighted when she realizes it means amplifying existing silence, and the later emergence of the first human reflects that change back through the world. Stakes remain more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: prophecy → cataloging buttons → echo reacting → deciphered line → sand into jar → river-shaped buttons → released echo → time-bridge. The piece operates primarily in an accumulative/lyric mode but retains enough because/therefore linkage to keep orientation and progression clear. Closure lands with Mara stepping onto the sand-bridge as the world “begins to rewrite its own story,” which functions as a resonant reconfiguration, albeit with little on-page cost. The structure is clean and self-contained, but the near-frictionless success softens the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: snow codes → pillbox compartments → altar → map → pass → spring → light, with each step clearly triggering the next. The drive lens feels largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the closure—a reconfigured stance toward courage and redemption—is on the page. However, escalation is smooth and low-friction; no turn truly threatens failure or derails his progress. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, not concretely dramatized in the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: the ticking gutters and evolving fog build toward the moment the ticking ceases, the river reveals silver light, and his promise is accepted. Causality is soft but present—he attends, “stitches,” waits for the gutters to fall silent, then receives a response. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the river shifts from barrier to bridge, and the palimpsest promise becomes a single visible mark. Stakes remain internal and modest, but the before/after is legible and thematically consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: she hypothesizes about fractured timelines, tests with the lantern, listens, and coaxes the hives back to life. Causality is gentle but legible (her attentive kindness → lantern response → hive awakening), and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration as the oasis “breathes again.” There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are anchored early and consistently. The main limitation is that the stakes and cost of failure feel low, so the closure lands more as an elegant concept than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is linear and coherent: Mara descends, performs a ritual (waiting for the last petal), plants luminous vines, and leaves at dawn with a modest sense of transformation. As an accumulative/textural piece, the repeating images (hush, oars, light) build toward a tonal closure where the harbor’s state is reconfigured from anxious to soothed. That said, the global drive is quite gentle, with no substantial turn beyond “she does what she planned,” so escalation and cost remain muted. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, but without a strong before/after price.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure reads as an accumulative lyric arc: preparation and ritual in the library, awakening and coexistence, then ascent and vow, all cohering around the sundial and stone circle. Causality is soft but legible—place sundial → hum awakens scripts → library sings → Mira’s stance shifts—and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing as she reframes “brittle awakenings” and steps into independence. Orientation is clean and the drive lens (textural/accumulative) holds. The main weakness is that cost and constraint at the end remain more conceptual than dramatized, muting the punch of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: Mira approaches the installation, interacts with it, and experiences a clear reconfiguration where the temple/spiral become conduits for unsent love letters. Causality within this lyric mode is coherent (each action—whispering, stepping on the spiral, placing the petal—leads to the next escalation), and closure lands with her choice to “rejoin” and the installation’s transformation into a monument. The cost of this closure is more conceptual than felt, so the before/after is legible but not deeply pressured. Orientation (who/where/what) is clean from the outset, with no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causality is coherent: signal → concern about tricksters → subsonic interference → thwarted false alarm → communal shift. The story follows a largely accumulative/textural pattern but still obeys basic because/therefore logic. However, escalation is compressed into summary (the valley joining, appliances, firehouse) and the resolution feels nearly effortless, with little visible price for success. Closure arrives as a clean reconfiguration toward harmony, but the cost of that shift is underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: he comes seeking a key, uses the compass and organ, the cavern mutinies, the passage opens, he traverses it, retrieves the key, and emerges changed. The piece maintains a single POV and continuous throughline, with the garden reveal and vow to share the passage providing a clear closure beat. The cost is mostly internal and subtle—facing his claustrophobia and the risk of entrapment—yet it is legible on the page. Structure is solid and publishable, though escalation is relatively smooth and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: Mara arrives at the quarry, paints, the quarry “responds,” and closure arrives with the fissure, carved names, and her internal reconfiguration. Causality is more mythic/accumulative than strictly logical but still coherent under that lens: her sustained ritual attention leads to the quarry revealing names. The ending provides a clear before/after—she regains empathy and a new mission—yet the path there feels too unresisted and free of complication. No significant orientation issues, but the lack of on-page obstacles or real tactical shifts blunts the sense of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: journals → riddles → chamber → nail → storm decision → encoded new stanza, with no glaring logic gaps. The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Mara’s stance toward her ancestor’s “reversible exile” solidifies into an ongoing guardianship of the story. However, the storm’s danger remains abstract—alarms blare, the vortex “threatened,” but no concrete near-loss or concrete consequence tests the new stakes. Structure is otherwise tight and linear, with backstory folded efficiently into the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → legend → map → ascent → song → amnesty-image → vow, under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is simple but coherent (legend motivates the climb; the climb enables the song; the song activates the amnesty via the plate). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the moment with the hitchhiker’s image and the vow to travel bridges reweights everything. Cost is more implied than dramatized, but the before/after is legible and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure—startup rise, mapping project, circus-train experiment, then crash and return—reads cleanly causal under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Arlen reframes loops and redirects his life toward “rewriting the map,” with the cost of disillusion and relinquished mythic violence implied. Much of the rise/fall arc is summarized rather than scened, which keeps pressure somewhat distant but doesn’t break coherence. Orientation is solid throughout, and the life-arc frame supports the quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal line—telegram arrives → she decides to “share the burden” → stars respond → temple vision/crystal key—is legible and the ending offers a clear resonant reconfiguration. Structure is straightforward and mostly accumulative-textural with light causal beats, and the closure is on-page. However, the path from problem to solution has no real complication or reversal; the inscriptions yield as soon as she aligns with the theme, so escalation and cost are thin. This keeps the piece from feeling structurally urgent enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: arrive at lake with seed → perform ritual with expanding circles → confession releases → she binds it into the seed/amulet and departs in a reconfigured world. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with the lake and orchard transformed and her stance softened. However, the path from setup to resolution is almost frictionless; the seed’s danger and the difficulty of unfreezing the confession are stated but never materially complicate her tactics. The global drive reads as Causal with lyric texture, but the lack of visible cost keeps it below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean and legible: rumor → exploration of the maze → contact with the hedges → vision and revelation → acquisition of the clipping → portal → beacon → return. Causality is coherent under a mostly causal, slightly accumulative lens, and the closure—her becoming the bridge and igniting the beacon—is on the page. The main weakness is the near-frictionless progression: each step succeeds without resistance, and cost is largely absent or implied in abstract terms. As a result the decisive change feels conceptually complete but dramatically under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: Maelia moves deeper into the orchard, performs a ritual, and emerges with a reweighted relationship to the pact and to herself. Causality is straightforward—card to soot to sigils to root reaction to final placement—and closure lands when the card dissolves into amber and her inner lack is partially repaired. The main weakness is the soft sense of cost; the “bartered destinies” premise implies danger but nothing on the page pushes back or threatens failure. Still, the before/after is legible, and the structure holds cleanly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: present in the quarry trailer framed by the earlier televised failure, accumulating through a night of work to a small but clear reorientation the next morning. Causality is simple but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens—the museum disaster leads to this exile-like shift and to the final reframing with the record player. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive action, but the before/after in her stance toward applause and purpose is legible and has a felt emotional cost. The piece edges toward summary in places but maintains a continuous, anchored window.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: Lira experiments with the seed, triggers a response from the arbor, experiences a conceptual shift, and chooses a new direction. Causality is intact (seed placement → arbor reaction → inner resolution), and the accumulative/lyric lens holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of ambition and transition, but the cost is soft and largely abstract. The piece reads more like a well-shaped vignette than a fully pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean lyric arc: tomorrow disappears, prompting the librarian to forge a key from memory, test it on the creel, realize his kinship with migrating identities, and embed that insight into the library’s routines. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens; each step follows logically from the last, and the final act of sealing the creel with the key provides on-page closure. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—he alters his role and softens his gears rather than facing overt loss—but the before/after is legible. No major set-ups are dropped, and the calendar rupture is satisfactorily metabolized into the new order.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, one-scene structure is clean: confessions → pearl activation → ritual of crowning → vow to spread the method, with a clear resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality within the lyric frame holds, and orientation in place and action is never in doubt. The main limitation is the low sense of cost or jeopardy at any point—nothing meaningfully threatens the ritual’s success or her ability to accept the new role. Closure lands, but without much structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: arrival → discovery of graffiti → descent to the tunnel → communion with the river → vow and departure, with each step deepening the same core drive. Causality is legible (graffiti literally routes the narrator to the tunnel and hence to the pivotal encounter) and the closure—accepting a repeated, “daringly methodical” pilgrimage rather than a one-time cure—reads as an Earned Stasis / Resonant Reconfiguration. Stakes are internal and modest but consistent; nothing crucial is left hanging. The only limit is that the decisive change is more conceptual than dramatized in a single charged action, keeping this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is linear and easy to follow: enter library → decode watch/whispers → uncover deeper chambers → reach garden of unspoken words. Causality is present but gentle; each discovery leads to the next, though obstacles are essentially absent. Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing, recognizing the library as a “living, cyclically reversed symphony” and vowing to document it. The lack of on-page cost or meaningful narrowing of options keeps this from feeling fully shaped for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: violin verification → discovery of telepathy/coffee-reading → revelation of the pact → time pressure → decision → envoy’s reaction → outcome. The structure is coherent as a single, continuous scene with an integrated clock (“before the promise loses its glow”), and closure lands via a decisive change in the city’s fate. The main weakness is that the envoy’s reversal happens very quickly and smoothly, softening the sense of earned difficulty at the climax. Still, the before/after is legible and the emotional cost is at least conceptually on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: she enters with a task, performs the infusion, and leaves the chip as a beacon, yielding a clear before/after with the world one step closer to oblivion yet holding a preserved spark. Causality is straightforward and intact, and the closure image (chip at the threshold, aurora’s final chorus) functions as a resonant reconfiguration. However, the path from intention to success is almost frictionless, and the cost of success remains largely conceptual. The global drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently, but the lack of on-page sacrifice limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: orientation comes early, the grotto ritual leads to a realization, and later vignettes (storm, harvest, elders) reinforce the new equilibrium. Causality is soft but present—hairpin ritual → inner shift → more effective caretaking and symbolic wine. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance on contentment and care is clarified and stabilized. However, the arc remains low-pressure and linear, with no real jeopardy or structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: lighthouse → wind chimes/pattern → mirror shard experiment → unhooking the decree’s knot → departure with reweighted understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the decree becomes a “living conversation” and the magistrate embraces the cloak of doubt, with Mara’s exit framing the before/after. However, causality is soft and largely symbolic—nothing seriously obstructs her goal, and the magistrate’s shift feels more like a foregone ritual than a pressured turning point. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is stable, but the cost of the change is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: platform → pond ritual → trance → journey to grotto → vision → conceptual shift, with a coherent throughline of seeking the grotto’s secret. Causality is gentle but legible (stone → patterns → guidance; trance → sensing magnetic pull; vow to wait → access to revelation). Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of what the grotto offers, though the cost of that new understanding remains largely abstract. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric component, and it holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: arrowhead discovery → appraisal ritual → bird-pattern reading → internalized map → inward turn. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she ends with a new inner navigation method and a quiet pledge of continuity. However, there is almost no meaningful turn or complication; each new element harmoniously slides into place without creating friction or narrowing options. The result is structurally clean but low in felt stakes or cost, which keeps it out of top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: ascent → approach → ritual unstrapping → mist walk → contact with stone → realization → descent, with each step flowing causally or at least plausibly accumulatively from the last. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where his metric of success re-prices itself. Cost is present conceptually (he turns away from institutional acclaim toward a solitary, sacred path), though it isn’t sharpened by any concrete lost opportunity on the page. There are no major causality breaks or orientation issues, but the path is almost too smooth to fully maximize the change.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: vow → clue → descent → discovery → return, with clear causal links under a largely accumulative/lyric lens. Orientation (who/where/roughly when) comes quickly and remains stable, and the transition into the sunken library is legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Eli now literally perceives and carries sound-color, with a map toward future quests. The main weakness is the absence of any real obstruction or price, which keeps the arc from feeling truly hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: decode coins → backward prophecy → turning the last coin → tonal revelation and revaluation of purpose. Causality holds throughout, and the final note of resonance provides a legible closure unit (a conceptual repricing of “purpose”) with the universe’s contraction as a persistent constraint. That said, the middle does not meaningfully complicate his path; the decoding proceeds without setback or reversal, so pressure tightens only modestly. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the atlas → crystallization → sequential naming → final revelation of the lover’s name, with each step clearly linked. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—grief reweighted into gratitude—on the page. Causality never breaks, and orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening. The only limitation is that the cost of the final change remains more conceptual than dramatically tested, keeping the arc powerful but not shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: imbalance → silent river → decision to rebuild bell via dripping rates → successful resonance → cosmic adjustment. The piece reads under a largely causal lens with lyric texture, and closure is clear both in the healed cosmos and the mage’s reframed self-understanding. However, pressure is low and obstacles are minimal; nothing seriously threatens failure once the method is chosen. Cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, which keeps the structural success from feeling fully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal thread—Caitlyn follows the photos, reconstructs the truth, and publicly reframes the town’s history—is legible and coherent. The piece functions on an accumulative drive: each photograph adds information and symbolic charge leading to a Conceptual Repricing of the town’s myth at the gathering. However, the investigation proceeds without friction or uncertainty, and key realizations (e.g., the clandestine trade) are accepted without on-page testing or doubt. Closure is present and thematically apt, but the path there is somewhat smoothed and summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ritual sequence unfolds in a clean causal chain: crystal placement → flame → starling pattern → thaw and alcove → explosion → shard spiral → ingestion → orchard transformation. The structure is single-scene accumulative, and the closure (she bridges mind and heart; the orchard changes) is legible. Cost is mostly implied as a profound change rather than a sacrifice, which keeps the arc from feeling fully consequential. Still, setup imagery (dew, flame, starlings) is nicely paid off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: storm → radio loss → climb → repair → descent → silent gratitude, and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration where his ongoing burden is reframed rather than solved. The drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural with a coherent through-line of responsibility and trust, and the final “Hold fast” crackle lands as a quiet but legible payoff. The cost at closure is modest—more conceptual than felt—and the stakes never narrow into a moment where failure seems possible. Still, the structure fits the length and holds together without orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Kael arrives with a goal, confronts the factions, acts by slicing the cylinder, and the resulting awakening reconfigures the situation into shared stewardship. Orientation is strong from the opening—who/where/what is clear despite the surreal setting—and the drive lens (causal with thematic overlay) holds. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change: brain freed, factions reconciled, dojo’s purpose transformed, Kael’s numbness cracked. The main weakness is that opposition is soft and brief (the factions “demand” and “shout,” but don’t force tactical adaptation), making the resolution feel a bit frictionless for the scale of the stated conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious seed arrives → Mara devises an adaptive escape room → participants solve puzzles → airflow triggers the bloom, leading to a conceptual closure about innovation. Orientation is solid early on, and the single continuous scene structure is easy to track. However, the plot lacks any meaningful complication or setback; once the premise is established, everything unfolds as planned without resistance. Closure lands as a mild resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and the cost of success is more implied effort than anything felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual steadily builds from first activation of the blower to the house’s reanimation, with a clear before/after in the soundscape and emotional charge. Causality is soft but coherent—pulling the cord, shaping gusts, and singing all plausibly cause the reawakening of laughter. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the house now “will hear laughter again whenever the wind dares to sing” and the conductor vanishes, though the cost of his vanishing is only lightly implied. There are no major orientation issues, but escalation is more tonal than decisional, which keeps the structure from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is simple and coherent: guardian in garden → discovery of pendant → contemplation and ritual → adoption of pendant and reconfigured role. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure builds through repeated motifs of waiting, light, and veil until the pendant is reframed as a key, giving a clear resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality is soft but adequate: the pendant’s discovery and properties motivate the guardian’s new purpose. The cost of potentially awakening a breach is mentioned but not sharply felt, which keeps the closure from landing at a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly causal: gather ember-ash → first failed tincture → refined attempts with new ingredients → successful vivification that cracks “destiny’s cage.” Closure is solid; the crozier’s transformation and the realm’s response clearly reconfigure his options and the story’s world. However, the path from problem to solution is fairly smooth—each iteration improves things without a serious setback or structural surprise—so escalation feels more incremental than gripping. Still, the piece holds a coherent drive and pays off its set-ups (penny drops, nexus, cage) on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: call (transmission) → climb and tuning → city reawakens → mapping and broadcast → communal response and archival closure. Causality largely holds, but pressure is light: nothing meaningfully resists her plan, and there’s no moment where failure feels live. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “endings” with visible external outcome (the city’s rebirth), yet the cost is almost entirely abstract. The accumulative/textural lens is stable, though the lack of a hard constraint or dilemma keeps it from feeling fully decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain (mysterious vanishings → Lio’s plan with radio/hourglass → success and permanent fix) is coherent and easy to follow. Structure is straightforward single-scene with a clean before/after closure (the ferry no longer vanishes). Cost is conceptually present (tampering with time, burden of responsibility) but never really bites on the page, so the decisive change feels somewhat frictionless. The “clocks run sideways” premise is underutilized as an active structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: enter gallery → weave → eruptions → bridge → exit with reweighted understanding. Causality within the lyric logic holds, and the closure (realizing imagination has “realistic weight” and carrying the thread into the city) qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing. However, there is no strong pivot or constraint that meaningfully narrows options—everything unfolds smoothly as a sequence of wonders. The result is aesthetically coherent but narratively soft for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative arc: discovery of aliens → adoption of edge geometry → test vessel → institutionalization via curricula → Mira’s closing vow. Closure is present as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration, with the final image reweighting the anchor link and Mira’s commitment. However, the plot remains largely expository and celebratory, with minimal concrete obstacles or turns; escalation is conceptual rather than dramatized. The structure works, but it feels more like an extended vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: detecting the hearing aid’s pulse leads to the photo, the alcove, the choir, synchronization, and finally the promise and restored photograph. Causality is intact and easy to trace, with each step deepening the central situation rather than meandering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s role in the city is conceptually reweighted by the final image of “distant heartbeats” as threads he is sworn to follow. The cost of this role, however, is only lightly implied and never concretely dramatized, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara arrives, aligns codex and cables, crosses via phase transition, receives/activates the map, and returns. The shift to the “cavernous chamber” is legible as a single big turn, and the return plus burial offers a modest but real closure unit (Earned Stasis / conceptual repricing). However, the touted danger of phase transition and dimensional void never complicates the plan—everything works on the first attempt without a genuine setback or cost. Structure is coherent but safe, with a resolved arc that lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: she starts with the problem (being declared dead and the ghost-loop), enacts a specific procedure (shard + ink defragmentation), and arrives at a reconfigured reality (one pulse, integrated wisdom). Causality is legible and steady—each step (retrieving the shard, spilling ink, reading the patterns) follows coherently from the last. Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting of her status and the ghost’s meaning, with a clear before/after in how she relates to her own “death.” The stakes resolve quietly but decisively, with no orientation or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: arrive at the tunnel → attempt to bind its echoes via the birds → the diamond opens and the new language is sealed into the canyon. Causality within the lyric frame holds: each move (inviting the diamond to listen, tracing bird patterns) leads to the next escalation and to the closure image of the language locked in bone walls. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: before, language risks death; after, it survives as inaccessible echo—preserved yet lost—with a conceptual cost. Orientation (who/where/what is happening) is legible early, and there are no jarring temporal or logical breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a largely linear single scene with a clear before/after: garden + sorrowful “beast” → laughter, transformed garden, and a repriced understanding of the creature. Causality is more atmospheric than tight—placing the arrowhead, the vines lifting the phone, and the beast’s tonal shift form a coherent sequence, but the rules of how and why these specific actions work remain vague. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with some cost (loss of the arrowhead, renunciation of the “monster” frame), but the victory comes very easily, with no real threat of failure. As accumulative/lyric structure it holds, yet for elite markets the escalation and price feel underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: music → statues’ warning → heart-guided locust shell → orchard awakening → regime’s soft transformation. Causality is legible and consistent, and the before/after (rusted oppression vs breathing orchard and softened gears) is clear on the page. Closure lands via a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules are materially altered and his mission continues outward. The main weakness is the relative ease of the transformation—resistance from the regime appears briefly and dissolves quickly, softening the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Milo arrives with the storm, uses it to blind the drone, and exploits the opening to deliver a truce message, which leads to the second drone’s peaceful response. The piece reads as a single, coherent scene with a clear before/after: a contested arcade vs. a tenuous bridge of trust. Closure is on the page (the mutual nod and crossed flight paths) with modest but legible cost in the spent storm and Milo’s risk. Stakes feel slightly abstract, but there are no serious orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: wrong turn → oasis → fragment on horse → carousel revival → hidden compartment → descent to mirrors → global reawakening. Causality within the lyric logic holds, and closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which the train and circus are permanently altered by her actions. However, the arc lacks a decisive tightening or cost at the end—everything opens, nothing is truly foreclosed. The piece reads as a smooth escalation of wonder rather than a pressured progression toward a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Mara’s subtle actions with geometry and the scarf gradually intensify until the analog memories manifest as a luminous projection and communal experience. Causality is legible within a lyric mode (“she whispers the algorithm” → space folds → memories surge), and orientation (who/where/when) is clear early. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the library’s role and the patrons’ solitude are reweighted by the communal story and Mara’s ongoing vigil. The main limitation is the lack of a sharp before/after cost—events unfold smoothly, with no real narrowing of options or irreversible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: Mara’s ritual → the photograph → Lio’s reception of the filament → Mara’s realization and a new shared practice, with a clear before/after in how longing is understood. Causality is soft but legible under the lyric mode—her act of vitalizing the image leads to a filament that connects to Lio, and that experience reconfigures the premise. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with modest but clear conceptual cost (accepting that the dream returns to the sea). The piece does lack any serious complication or threatened failure, so the arc feels more like a graceful curve than a pressured turn.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: star → path → groove revelation → unlocking → legend, with a clear before/after around freeing the idea. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—conceptual repricing of fear vs courage through the liberated filament and ensuing legend. However, causality involves almost no resistance; every step unfolds as benign inevitability, so the decisive change lacks a palpable price. The nexus “exhaling” and the path across galaxies are effective but feel more decorative than the culmination of tested stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: detecting mythic energy → mapping broken constellations → finding the sextant → rearranging the fairy ring → orchard memories returning. The closure (memories restored, greenhouse as testament) is legible and satisfying, with a clear before/after. However, the path is almost frictionless—no false starts, failed attempts, or genuine risk—so escalation under a causal/accumulative lens feels modest. The retrospective opening (“Decades later…”) is structurally clean but doesn’t deepen on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: entering with the trapped shadow, annotating tea-leaf journals, triggering the noon alignment, then using the resulting knowledge to reach the altar and end the exile. Causality is clear—her annotations and the tea-leaf method directly produce the timing, the map, and the final ritual—while the accumulative, lyric pattern is taught early and held. Closure lands on-page with the decisive undoing of the library’s exile and a reconfigured, guarded future, though the sense of what might have happened had she failed is diffuse. The drive lens reads as Accumulative with a causal spine, and it holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The structure is basically accumulative: seed found → ritual with water → orchard transformed → traveler carries hope outward. Causality is soft but legible within the fable-like frame, and the ending offers a resonant stasis where hope now persists across worlds. However, the stakes stay abstract and are never tested—nothing seriously threatens his goal beyond a briefly mentioned storm that resolves easily when he sings. The closure has conceptual shape but little on-page cost, so it lands more as a pretty tableau than a hard-earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly linear: Elara works through knots, spirits rise, the net collapses into a thread, the mask is completed, and the sanctuary settles. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent and the closure—a reconfigured peace and sealed sanctuary—lands clearly with a before/after. However, escalation is gentle and largely procedural; no moment significantly alters the range of possible outcomes. Causality is intact but the scene feels like watching a ritual we’re told will work rather than witnessing a process whose success is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: each pass of observation (map tear → stone fissure → aligned rain → emergent glyphs) deepens the central premise until the chapel’s “reopening” and portal realization close the arc. Causality is coherent at this lyric scale, and the ending’s reconfiguration of the map tear from flaw to portal lands as an on-page conceptual repricing. Stakes and cost are more conceptual than concrete, but the before/after in meaning is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean and legible: Mort explores, untangles, triggers the transmission, listens, reflects, then leaves, with the snow globe and cylinder shaping the arc. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from object to idea to final image in a coherent progression. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “letting go,” marked by the globe’s shattering and Mort’s note. The main limitation is that the journey from start to finish feels steady rather than tightly ratcheting, so the decisive shift is more tonal than structurally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure built around the three lightning strikes is coherent and easy to follow, and each strike deepens the exchange between balladeer and ghost. Closure is solid: the ghost’s need is voiced and answered, and the courtyard becomes a living archive, a clear before/after reconfiguration. Causality is soft but sufficient under a textural lens (ritual actions → ghost’s response → enduring mural). There’s little sense of risk or constraint shaping tactics, so the arc feels more ritualistic than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal chain is clean: elevator ascent → discovery of chest/diary → goggles unlock cipher → revelation of hidden chamber → descent and retrieval → return and recommitment. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a clear before/after centered on recovering stored laughter. Yet each stage unfolds without real complication, surprise, or meaningful constraint, so escalation and cost at the structural level remain modest. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration, but the journey feels pre-smoothed rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural arc: the vigil in the gondola, the emotional cloud taxonomy, the inscribing of emotions, and the comet sighting build toward a conceptual repricing of emptiness as memory-laden. Causality is gentle but coherent—each beat proceeds logically from her project of memorialization, and the final dawn/gondola-lullaby gives a clear sense of closure. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, not sharply dramatized, which limits impact. Still, the structure is clean, unified, and well-contained within one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a mostly single-scene, accumulative structure: preparation → ritualized painting guided by the coin → demolition and aftermath, with a clear before/after once the building falls and the interior remains a “cathedral of sky.” Causality is coherent if soft; the constellated coin and pigment ritual guide her process and tie into the climax where the coin presses into wet paint. Closure functions as Resonant Reconfiguration: the world outside collapses while the crafted sky persists, reweighting the premise of limits and preservation. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (we don’t feel the loss of the library or Lira’s risk in concrete terms), which keeps this short of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: investigation → ritual (words, board, chalk) → manifestation of luminance → channeling it into the engine, all in a single, legible scene. Causality is mostly sound and orientation is excellent, but the closure lacks a strong sense of cost or irreversible shift beyond “the engine hums anew” and a warmer cabin. The final turn feels like a gentle success rather than a pressured reconfiguration. For a prestigious venue, the ending needs a sharper before/after or more charged consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal spine is clean: prophecy → search → hall of mirrors → unlocking the pedestal → repairing the clock → leaving with renewed purpose. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the closure (repairing the clock and departing with a steady tick) is on the page and legible as a before/after shift. However, nearly every obstacle yields smoothly, with no meaningful failure or complication, so the beats feel more ceremonial than pressured. The drive lens reads as accumulative/lyric rather than strongly causal, which slightly limits structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    The causal chain—chalk message → communal gathering → bell-ringing ritual → renewed commitment—reads cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchards now “thrumm[ing] with a brambled hope” and a seasonal rite established. However, stakes never truly tighten; nothing serious threatens the ritual or the community beyond implied past hardship, so the before/after shift lacks a sharp sense of cost. Structure is coherent but low-pressure for an elite-market piece.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: arrival at the lighthouse → ritual with the puppet and clock → pane of hush → world’s pause → departure. Causality within the magical logic is coherent (her actions with the dial and head lead to the hush and the global pause), and the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration where the world gains a “borrowed pause” at a conceptual cost. However, the lack of genuine setbacks or altered tactics keeps the arc feeling like a foregone solemn ritual rather than a pressured sequence of turns. Orientation is excellent from the outset, and the closure beat lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: investigation and pattern-making lead logically to the altar scene, activation of the nut, illumination of the maze, and the caretaker’s departure. Causality holds—assembling clues, tracing impressions, and reaching the stump all pay off coherently in the orchard’s brief transformation and the travelers’ escape. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the blueprint’s purpose is fulfilled for one night, the curse persists, and the protagonist’s role ends with a clear before/after. The only limitation is that several steps (months of clue-assembly, the “bargain”) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly flattening the sense of real-time turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: ravine insight → improvised experiment → lab implementation → regional impact → cyclical return, forming a coherent causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is strong: the polymer curing real bridges and the child’s chrysalis concretely reconfigure Mara’s relationship to her failure, with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that turns are smooth and relatively unpressured—each step succeeds without much complication or doubt—which softens the sense of cost. Still, the narrative is well-shaped and lands its ending cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: arrival → ritual with moonlight → conceptual realization → relay to the child → choral closure. Causality within the magical logic generally holds (placing/incising the moonlight leads to scripts igniting and a new story being born). Closure is present as a conceptual repricing—the origin of stories as quantified absence turned to light—but the cost of that realization is soft and mostly asserted. The lack of real resistance or complication keeps this from feeling fully shaped for high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: Lir approaches the pavilion, engages the ritual, intensifies contact, and the fortress subtly transforms, giving a legible before/after. Causality is soft but present—his tasting and hand motions lead to cracking coral and dispersed remorse—without stray or unkept set-ups. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress moves from burdened to “brittle resilience,” with a conceptual cost in that healing leaves things fragile. The main limitation is that the path from risk to resolution feels frictionless, with no moment where failure or backlash seems genuinely possible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural ritual: retrieve the weight → release the chime → awaken silos/workers → build bridges → return the weight. Closure is clear—the city moves from isolated silos to unified bridges, and the final chime at dawn is a resonant reconfiguration—but cost remains abstract and untested. Causality is broadly coherent but soft: resistance, failure modes, or alternative outcomes are never dramatized, so pressure doesn’t truly narrow options. Still, the circular structure (weight taken and then replaced) and the before/after city stance give a legible arc.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival → setup and calibration → canyon response and tremor → successful communion → departure with altered tool and clarified mission. Causality holds—each step grows from the last—and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Aria leaves with humming shards and a newly charged purpose. However, the stakes are mostly conceptual and the “risk” (the canyon fracturing, the bridge shattering) never materializes in a way that forces a truly pressured choice. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric component, and that holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: mysterious doodle → recognition → timed journey → threshold → discovery → return and integration into the archive. Structure is linear and legible, and the closure (she acquires the seedlings and begins cataloging new combinations) lands clearly. However, the hour-long inversion functions more as a spectacle window than a constraining engine of difficult choices, and there’s no serious risk of failure dramatized. The cost of success is conceptual rather than sharply felt, keeping this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: Auris prepares, experiments with the sculpture and insulator, and culminates in the grove’s reconfiguration into an “archive of cracks turned into chords.” Causality is soft but legible—his methodical strumming and attention to stress cracks lead to the grove’s sonic awakening. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing of silence rather than a decisive action with heavy cost, but it lands clearly. Orientation is solid from early on (who/where/when are anchored), and the text teaches its pattern of repetition and build.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece works under an accumulative/textural lens: walking through the nexus, handling the stone, and staging an imagined chessboard build toward the covenant’s re-interpretation. Causality is soft but coherent—each move (stone, phrase, piece placement) leads to the sky’s response and his revised stance. Closure is present as a resonant reconfiguration, but the “before/after” cost is mild and primarily conceptual. Structural variety or a sharper hinge event would strengthen publishable-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: entering the workshop → ritual of tuning → unlocking the diary → rooftop revelation and vow, with a clear conceptual repricing of “empathy” at the end. Causality is soft but legible under a lyric/textural lens, and the closure image of the glowing diary and apprentices entering the workshop is satisfying. However, there’s little sense that failure is possible at any stage; the ritual proceeds without complication and the fireworks timing is more flourish than pressure. The cost of the achieved change remains conceptual rather than dramatized, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: small ritual acts and sensory impressions accrue until the corpse flower blooms and the village custom crystallizes. Causality is simple but coherent (seed → tending → sprout → bloom → communal adoption of her practice), and the closure image of the village breathing in the scent provides a clear before/after. That said, the decisive change carries minimal cost and the bloom unfolds exactly as foretold, so the ending lacks bite. Structural stakes stay low, and the “test” of the heart balancing hope and humility never produces a real risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    The structure is linear and clear: mission → traversal → discovery → test → return and release, with solid causal linkage. Closure is present—Mira finds the resilience source and enacts a ritual that reconfigures the orchard’s future—but the stakes never tighten beyond a calm success path. No major obstacle or reversal complicates the middle, so pressure feels flat even as events progress. The drive lens reads as primarily causal, with some accumulative lyric texture, and it holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the labyrinth, methodical surveying, identification of the convergence, and signaling that triggers release. Causality is mostly sound and the accumulative/textural lens (data and images building to a vortex release) holds. Closure is on-page with a discernible before/after: the town’s silence breaks and the storm’s residue dissipates. The main limitation is that the storm “vortex” behaves almost like a switch that flips once she signals, with minimal complication or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric design with one continuous ritual scene and some projected futures, and it does land a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern and silence are reweighted by her act. Causality is simple but coherent—she performs the song, the cavern is altered, the echo lingers—and the closure image of the pulsing amber sheet gives a clear before/after. However, the structural arc is very flat; there is no meaningful tightening of options or new constraint, and the “cost” of her action is almost entirely conceptual. The imagined future travelers add scope but not structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → path-marking → seam-opening → crossing → insight → return, all under one clear drive. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing—redefining guardianship as listening to failure—with a corresponding final image of the silent song carried to the stars. Causality is intact and legible, but the lack of obstacles or reversals means the journey feels more like a successful ritual than a pressured sequence of choices. The cost of this shift is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the structural impact moderate rather than towering.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: preparation → pressing the halo fragment → workshop transformation → final crack/shards, with a clear before/after around the fragment’s activation. Causality in a literal sense is soft but legible within the speculative conceit (pressing ink onto the fragment triggers the change), and the story sustains one dominant drive: pursuing the theorem of emotion. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—emotion as “transposed function”—with the halo fragment’s cracking and shard-collection providing an on-page hinge. Still, the cost of this closure is under-articulated, so the shift reads more as evolution of an idea than as a pressured narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure—courier → shepherd → girl → future legends and pilgrimage—is coherent and easy to follow, with a clear before/after conceptual shift in how the ridgeway is viewed. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the ridgeway becomes a mythic pilgrimage site because of these extended encounters. However, the beats feel more like linked vignettes than escalating tests; there’s no point where events seriously narrow his options or risk failure. The future-summary epilogue is thematically tidy but further reduces any sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves causally from preparation (placing the prism) to activation (chant, frost, grief, engine) to realization and vow. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: the world’s ontology changes for Liora as she proves her hypothesis and accepts its implications. The causal links are solidly legible, with no orientation issues, but the decisive change is more conceptual than pressured—nothing serious threatens failure or misinterpretation. The ending’s image of the road and prism provides a coherent after/before, though the sense of “no going back” could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is clean: call to restore unraveling sound → puzzle-path journey → pedestal/amber climax → quiet denouement. Causality and accumulative pressure are coherent, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the message is sent and the silence retreats. Still, the core stakes (who the message is for, what exactly is risked) stay abstract, so the decisive act doesn’t fully bite emotionally or conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → decision → mines → memory barter → silk → empowered forging → public demonstration, with no broken links. The closure beat—using the silk-forged blade to literally knit rubble into crystal vines—delivers a resonant before/after tied to his initial haunted failures and the bartered memory. However, the journey is almost frictionless: the mines pose no real danger, access to the silk is granted on first attempt, and the demonstration succeeds immediately, so cost remains mostly conceptual. Structure (two main shards: descent, then return/forge) is clear and supports an accumulative drive toward a single closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is coherent: shard → map alignment → universe shift → log discovery → freeing the crew, and closure lands with a clear before/after. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric coloration, and the ending delivers a Decisive Change plus a mild Resonant Reconfiguration. That said, each step succeeds on the first attempt; no beat truly complicates the plan or forces a structural change of tactic. The result is satisfying but somewhat pre-ordained, lowering narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene from arrival to departure, with a clear accumulative drive as the ritual builds and the lighthouse’s mood shifts. Causality is soft but coherent: the extinguished lamp → Marek’s ritual → stone spiral pulse → reconfigured sense of sanctuary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change: the haunted room becomes a sanctuary and Marek leaves with a talismanic sea glass and a vow. The main limitation is low felt cost; no option is meaningfully foreclosed, so the before/after remains more tonal than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: arrival → ritual activation → prophetic symbols → decision to act → redirected storm → new dawn, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the world is “reborn in shadowed brilliance”—and this is on-page and legible. However, the global drive remains more atmospheric than pressured; while the prophecy prompts “We must act now,” the precise consequences of failure are left hazy, which blunts the felt cost. All props and beats track without contradictions, and there’s no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: tea house → wing and sun trails → scroll revelation → garden path → loom transformation, all causally linked. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and closure arrives via conceptual repricing when Lira understands story-magnet people and installs the wing on the loom as a permanent beacon. Causality is intact and orientation is strong from the opening. The main limitation is that the turns are smooth rather than pressured, so the decisive shift feels more like a graceful unfolding than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene with a clear task (deconstruct the echo-grid) progressing step by step to a calm resolution. Causality holds—using the sextant to map dreams allows the grid’s filaments to dissolve, lifting sorrow from the labyrinth. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the maze’s sorrow becomes “measurable peace,” and Eli leaves with a changed inner state. Still, escalation is linear and frictionless, so the decisive change reads more like a completion of process than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: song → light → orchard awakening → spirits arriving → world rekindled. Causality is legible and consistent, and the closure (the realm entering a “gentle, unstoppable sunrise” with Lira’s purpose fixed) is clear. However, almost no resistance, failure, or complication appears; events unfold as a smooth escalation of success, which flattens dramatic impact. The drive lens is solidly accumulative/textural and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: invitation → inner conflict → portal opening via the desk → encounter with curator → mirror confrontation → altered stance as he returns to the city. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he reinterprets his mistake and his role in the world, with a clear before/after in how he carries his grief and sanctuary. Structure is straightforward single-POV with no orientation issues, and the library’s rules feel consistent enough for this length. The cost is mostly internal and somewhat underplayed—facing the abandoned friend is compressed into a few lines rather than a fuller test.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: garden → discovery of the tin box → tea house ritual → departure, with a clear before/after in his renewed resolve. Causality is mostly gentle (“because he finds the loaf, he carries it to the tea house, slices it, remembers, and reframes the ordinary”), which suits the lyric mode. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is very light and the global drive lens (accumulative/textural) could be more sharply taught via one stronger pivot. Nothing breaks, but it stops short of feeling structurally decisive for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: retrieve the slide → measure the silence → awaken the vows → arrive at a reconfigured relation to oblivion. Causality within the ritual is legible and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration, as the “edge of oblivion” recedes into a “corridor of meaning” with a clear before/after. That said, the middle does not materially complicate or threaten failure; the process is patient but largely untroubled, so the cost remains conceptual more than dramatic. Orientation (who/where/what she’s doing) is excellent from early on and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal chain is straightforward and legible: Lila enters with a mission, triggers her decoy, intercepts the scout, protects the lanterns, and reports to the elders, with closure in the dawn departure. The “truce of hush” frames stakes and ending nicely, but the central heist conflict resolves very quickly, with little sense that failure was a live possibility. Closure functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the truce holds for now, future conflict implied—but the cost is muted, largely conceptual. Orientation is strong from the opening; no structural or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative/textural arc: devices converge, tasting intensifies, the forest election concludes, humidity shifts, and Arin arrives at a conceptual revaluation of “weather carriers.” Causality within the world’s logic is consistent—the spores altering humidity and nudging the compass is a strong causal beat. Closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing with a clear before/after in understanding, even if the stakes are intellectual rather than perilous. The structure is cleanly single-scene and holds its lens without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival in cave → attraction to lock → decision to paint with hidden mirror → reflection unlocks the locker → vial enables her creative resolution and exit. The piece reads as a mostly continuous scene with a clear before/after: blocked vs. unblocked creativity. Closure is solidly on the page with the vial and the glowing painting functioning as a resolved reconfiguration of her relationship to inspiration. Escalation is gentle and lyric rather than high-stakes, but there are no causality breaks or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: refusal → map → doorway → cavern of recorded speech → conduit → vent → healed sky, with the zinc plate and map recurring as structural anchors. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change and conceptual repricing: truthful speech literally alters the toxic sky. However, the council threat and potential consequences of disloyalty are raised then dropped, and the ease with which she accesses the vent and changes the world softens the sense of earned cost. Structure is coherent and legible but a touch schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/lyric vignette rather than a causal arc, and under that lens the structure is coherent: daily tending → communal witnessing → quiet nightly closure. There is a clear before/after in the final beat—a charged poise where his commitment and the bluff’s “recording” of the symphony crystallize—so closure does land. However, there is little sense of change in options or situation; most sentences reassert an already-known state rather than tighten or turn it. The “season of silence” remains background worldbuilding rather than an active structural hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: magnetic shift → shielding flicker/threat → decision to miniaturize chaos in the box → successful controlled burn → reconfiguration of Vira’s relationship to fear. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fear-box becomes a seed of calm integrated into the farm, and Vira’s vigilance relaxes. However, the path is almost frictionless—no meaningful setback, doubt, or failed attempt—so the cost of the resolution stays conceptual rather than sharply felt. Structure remains linear and legible with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is linear and legible: discovery of the mailbox/locket → explanation of how it works → creation of an exhibit → coda with the child. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, with listening moments building toward a charged poise rather than a sharp turn. Causality is soft but coherent; the locket’s rules are implied rather than exploited in a way that tightens options. Closure exists conceptually (Mara’s practice extends to the boy), but the cost and decisive change remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure works well in an accumulative/lyric mode: dice → song → crystal → journal → lab’s rising → legend is a clear, coherent chain. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration where the lab’s liberation and Selene’s encoding of weakness recast the whole piece. However, cost at the ending is more conceptual than felt; nothing concrete is lost or truly foreclosed for Selene. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent, but the before/after divide could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: mornings with coffee grounds lead causally to the chamber’s activation, the excavation of the fissure, emergence of memories, and a rebalanced world. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and the closure (a conceptual repricing of “deleted” as “compressed” and recoverable) lands. That said, the path is frictionless—no setbacks, reversals, or hard choices—and the cost of success is minimal, which limits the depth of the ending’s impact. Still, orientation is strong and the piece feels structurally complete.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line of the ritual is coherent: she arrives with a goal, deploys the crane’s wing, maps silence, and the world and prophecy are altered by the end. The accumulative, incantatory structure fits the material and the closure is legible—prophecy sealed, environment reconfigured into stillness and star-river. However, stakes remain mostly abstract; we’re told of a “celestial rupture” but never feel its concrete threat or see any genuine risk of failure. The ending offers a clean Decisive Change with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: a single core night with a brief follow-up evening, causally linked from seal → sugar borrowing → tea ritual → redefined quest. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the narrator’s understanding of their quest and relationship to the building shifts in a legible before/after way. However, the causal stakes remain low—nothing truly resists the protagonist’s goal—and the cost of this new path is more implied than dramatized. The accumulative/textural drive holds, but the lack of friction keeps it shy of top-tier structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: Lira in the garden, listening to the shell, archiving, then fusing shell-light with dawn and leaving. Causality is soft but present—each listening and recording leads to the final reframing—and the orientation (who/where/when) is clear early with no lens confusion. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of isolation, but the sense of real cost or constrained options is muted because nothing on the page resists or complicates her goal. The piece reads as a smooth meditation more than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.0)
    The piece functions as a single, accumulative scene that moves logically from work → revelation → ritual inscription → vow, and it lands a legible resonant reconfiguration at the end. However, there is a concrete causality error: “The key with no apparent lock melted into the stone, its purpose fulfilled” is later contradicted by “She tucked the key with no apparent lock into the folds of her robe,” which undercuts trust in the line-by-line sequence and the closure object. Stakes and turns are mostly internal and textural rather than decisively causal, which is fine for the chosen mode but keeps the structural feel relatively soft. Overall, the arc holds, but that prop inconsistency would need fixing for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: journey along the spiral, incremental memory-echos, the cavern revelation, and the final act of uniting the shells. Causality is clear enough under a textural lens—each layer of echo leads her deeper, culminating in a conceptual repricing where echoes become "living memories seeking release." Closure lands on the page and reweights the premise, but the path feels frictionless: no meaningful obstacle or competing option tests her goal. The webs of intrigue and constellations suggest complexity yet never create genuine structural complication.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: she descends to the shrine, interprets dreams, recognizes a lattice, activates the globe, sends out a final dream, then wakes to evidence of success and departs. Cause-and-effect is legible under a textural lens—the dream analysis leads to recognition of the lattice, which enables the portal and her closing action. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the globe shifts from relic to beacon, and her task reframes from solitary salvage to guiding many dreamers. The main limitation is that stakes and cost remain abstract, so the structural turn feels more conceptual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is a calm, accumulative lyric scene with a soft reprise on the “next evening,” and causality is straightforward: observation → ritual with whisk/whistle → return and confirmation of meaning. The drive lens is clearly accumulative/textural rather than causal; pressure does not narrow options so much as enrich a contemplative loop. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the second-night echo reweights the initial ritual as an ongoing covenant with hidden labor, but the cost of this stance is only faintly implied (continued solitary vigilance). The main weakness is structural flatness—no meaningful disruption or turn, so the before/after distinction remains conceptual rather than dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: rumor → investigation → letter reconstruction → map → diamond → realization → plan to protect. Structure is linear and efficient, with one clear escalation through the puzzle-solving beat at night and a decisive closure when the orchard transforms and Mira chooses secrecy/protection. However, obstacles are minimal (the radiation and “curse” never concretely threaten her), so tension across beats remains modest. Closure is present and coherent but would benefit from a sharper felt cost or a more testing climactic decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: storm → mirrors/radio verses → Selene’s covenant → coils/drones → sunrise and pledged allegiance, with a clear before/after in the final dawn. Causality is present but somewhat soft, often conveyed in summary (“Guided by that promise, the visionary rallied the scattered clans”) rather than concrete beats. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s relationship to “ancient shadows” is reweighted, and the observatory becomes a lighthouse. The cost of achieving this shift, however, is largely implied and never concretely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: arrival at the loft → discovery of the music box → systematic capturing of sounds → sharing them with a child → departure with renewed purpose. Causality is soft but coherent; each step grows naturally from the last, and the closure (loft as “chapel of resonance,” poet walking toward sunrise changed) is legible as a resonant reconfiguration. That said, there is only a gentle tightening rather than a marked turn or complication, so the before/after line is emotionally persuasive but not dramatically sharp. Orientation is clear from early on, and the pattern is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: council charge → experimental setup → resonance test → hidden panel → descent → vault unlocking → recalibration for safe use → quiet aftermath, with no major logic breaks. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and the closure (artifact secured and reconfigured toward healing; Elara personally absolved) is legible with some emotional cost. However, the central danger—weaponization by seekers—is never concretized on the page, so the plot’s stakes feel more declared than tested. Structurally the piece holds together well but stops short of a truly pressured climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → observation and data-gathering → magnetic surge at moon’s apex → interior reconfiguration and mantra. Causality is soft but coherent: her sustained watching and note-taking lead into the viaduct experiment, which in turn precipitates the realization. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration, with the final edge-of-ice beat clearly marking the “before/after” in her stance toward time. Stakes and cost are modest and mostly interior, which limits impact but not clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal spine is clean: investigation of seepage → anomalous lantern–humidity interaction → discovery of hidden pipe → valve turn and redirection of water. The piece delivers on closure with a decisive physical change and a reweighted relationship to the tunnel and city. That said, the danger remains largely hypothetical—no on-page near-failure or complication tests the plan—and the quasi-mystical link between lantern and moisture is accepted without friction. Structure is solid but not yet gripping at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: chaplain seeks second opinion → examination reveals need for a new spring → collaborative repair → the heart beats → he exits with a reoriented mission. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains stable. Closure is present as both a decisive change (the heart begins to beat) and a resonant reconfiguration (he reframes his ministry), but the cost of the choice stays mostly conceptual and untested by any hard consequence. The scene is a single smooth arc with no serious causality slips, though it errs on the safe, predictable side.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece follows a clean arc: approach the bell → ring it → receive a new map/mission. Causality is coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure (a new course set after the bell’s inaudible ring) is legible as a conceptual repricing of the world’s “rules.” However, the lack of complication or reversal means the structure feels more like a beautifully described vignette than a fully pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: resurfaced patch → number pattern → deliberate test/lie → algorithmic scattering → hidden server farm → checksum key → vault → final conceptual shift about “deleted” presence. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear closure unit centered on conceptual repricing of deletion as a form of stored presence. Cost is more conceptual than dramatic—no real sacrifice or double bind—but the before/after in Lia’s understanding and in the archive’s function is legible. The piece holds a mostly causal lens with light accumulative texture from the recurring motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clear and linear: call → approach orchard/van → mirror ritual → crystal restored → world shifts, which satisfies basic coherence for an accumulative/lyric piece. However, the stakes and cost remain low and generalized—nothing tests the method or threatens failure, so the “reconstitution” feels inevitable rather than earned. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (the world “breathes in unison”), but the before/after line carries little tangible price. Causality is intact, yet the lack of friction or complication keeps the plot from feeling fully shaped for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clean: arrival, volunteering, night vigil, and dawn realization form a coherent arc with a clear before/after in her relationship to death. Closure is solid as a conceptual repricing—she reframes her journey from seeking death to accepting endings—and the heirloom object and marina recur to charge that beat. Causality is intentionally soft; events mostly provide textures through which she processes her existing crisis rather than forcing new options, so escalation is more tonal than situational. Still, nothing important is left dangling and the temporal flow (day → night → dawn) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece follows a coherent accumulative/textural structure: he encounters the scrap, decides to plant it, communes with the vines, and arrives at a reconfigured understanding of his role. Causality is soft but present—his ritual with the letter leads to the glowing scrap and his internal shift—yet the cost and stakes of that shift remain low and abstract. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (he reframes his solitude as a vocation), but it’s achieved with little resistance. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the outset, and the pattern of lyric accretion is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    The structure is clean: prophet arrives → Keeper consecrates the space → teaching occurs → lingering echo → Keeper embraces an ongoing task. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration where the “echo of wisdom” extends from pavilion to desert and then into his vocation. Causality is simple but coherent, with no orientation issues. The main weakness is that the decisive change is low-stakes and largely declared, with only a soft sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure follows an accumulative/textural drive: setup of Mara’s mission, the assembling of images, villagers arriving, and a ceremonially inflected closure around the feather and glowing field. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the town’s pain is partially transformed into shared memory—but escalation is gentle and largely foregone. Causality is coherent, yet the story verges on a static ritual rather than a pressured arc, which limits structural impact for a high-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure (arrival → decoding → return with offering) is clear and coherent, with the crystal as a through-line. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Mara reframes language as a living pulse and her role as ongoing witness rather than solver. Causality is soft but serviceable; each step follows plausibly from the last, though stakes and costs remain modest. No orientation issues, but the decisive change feels more conceptual than dramatically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure follows a clean accumulative arc: quest for chalk → navigation deeper into the garden → encounter with the monolith → recording/inscription and exit at dawn. Causality is coherent, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where he reframes “capturing” aging as letting it ripple outward via echoes. The cost—accepting forgetting while choosing to leave an echo for others—is legible but still somewhat gentle, with little real resistance. Overall, the drive lens (accumulative/textural) is consistent and closure is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → diagnosis → attunement to the leaf → restructuring → successful repair → reflective exit, with each step legible and causally linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the observatory’s function and the “luminous ache” both shift into a steadier, purposeful state. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and atmospheric (no concrete failure scenario is dramatized), which dampens urgency. Still, the throughline of fixing the spinning hand into a stable power source holds together without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene from preparation through Harlan’s death to the staff’s quiet aftermath, with a legible before/after. Causality is straightforward—Mara prepares the ritual, performs it, he dies, then the keepsake distribution and balcony moment land as closure (a resonant reconfiguration). However, there is little sense of developing obstacles or decisions that might alter the course of events, so the middle reads more like sustained atmosphere than progression. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the closure functions, but the path there feels somewhat flat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is lucid: Lira relearns closing loops → activates the key → opens the doorway → accesses the isle’s core and resolves the riddle. Structure is cleanly single-threaded with a legible before/after, and the closure (her understanding of shadows’ destination and the isle’s heartbeat) lands on the page. The main weakness is that each step unfolds smoothly without setback or difficult choice, so while coherent, the arc can feel frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara enters the garden, discovers the substitute body and baby tooth, uses bone-setting to restore the spine, and then reconfigures this experience into her star-mapping practice. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with a coherent RR/CR closure when “mistakes” are reconceived as dark matter binding the universe. However, escalation in options or consequences is mild; things proceed without setback or hard choice, so the before/after is more conceptual than dramatically earned. Closure is present and legible, but the cost remains largely implicit and low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: entering the grotto, arranging and polishing glass, chanting, and completing the spiral form a coherent progression. Closure is present in the completion of the glass circle and her settled sense of purpose, but there is no strong decisive turn—more a gentle deepening of an already-declared intent. Causality is simple yet consistent; nothing breaks, but nothing meaningfully constricts options either. The before/after is legible conceptually, though cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: Lira moves through the garden, follows the drip pattern, activates the interface, and reprograms the servers, leading to a resonant reconfiguration in which the space becomes a “living archive.” Causality is soft but present—pendant → interface activation → code rewriting → garden’s hum and online spread—and the before/after is legible with conceptual cost. Structure is essentially a single scene with smooth progression, no orientation issues, and a clear closure image. The lack of significant obstacle or pushback keeps the arc feeling somewhat frictionless, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is consistent: she enters the nexus, gathers hopes via cameos, binds them, and exits with a renewed commitment. Causality is soft but legible—her actions with the seashell and notebook lead to the mist thickening and the story “settling into a calm.” Closure functions as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, with her accepting an ongoing, upstream labor of hope-collection. However, the before/after line is faint and the cost of her choice remains mostly conceptual, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative ritual structure is clean: arrival → preparation → musical activation → harvest moon apex → vow and aftermath. Causality is coherent under a textural lens: the lyre-playing and vine response build toward the moon’s zenith, with the pollen cascade functioning as a clear closure beat. The Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration is legible—old rites are reanimated and bound into Mara’s obligation. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after of a valley without/with living rites is clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual arc with an accumulative/textural drive: preparation → ignition → binding → covenant. Causality within the magic is legible enough (formula → flare → starlight burst → debris binding). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as she reframes her work as a covenant, with a clear before/after in how firmly she’s bound to the orchard. What’s missing for higher bands is any significant tightening or complication of options beyond the smooth progress of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Corin arrives, studies reflections, repairs the timer with a crystal, and begins harvesting echoes, culminating in a re-framing of the “cellar of reason.” Causality is clean at the mechanical level—each step leads to the next—and the orientation (who/where/what he’s doing) is solid from early on. Closure qualifies as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the cellar shifts from prison to library, and his ongoing work is framed as a lasting legacy, though the cost is minimal and largely conceptual. The structure feels more like a single, gently rising arc of process than a scene with a decisive tightening or hard before/after line.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent ritual arc: arrive → reveal burdens → transmute → leave, with each step causally linked. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which the grotto’s role shifts from hoarder of sorrow to transformative sanctuary, clearly marked by the feather of balance and the lullaby-like hush. Cost is present conceptually (the grotto’s grief is altered and fixed into a new pattern), but the process is almost frictionless, with no serious threat of failure or reversal. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, yet the lack of meaningful resistance keeps the structure from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens cleanly: kettle on, carving work, alchemical crystallization, emerging lantern, brief outward walk, and a return to stasis reweighted by acceptance. Causality is coherent (steam enables crystallization; carving enables containment; containment enables her reframed stance on loss), and orientation is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she exits the loft with a new relationship to her grief, and the lantern concretizes that shift. The main limitation is the absence of a strong structural tightening or turn; the arc is more gentle gradient than decisive hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: Mara collects story-fragments → arranges them → uses the camera wheel as conduit → receives and witnesses a decisive memory → adopts a new stance. Causality under a textural lens holds throughout; each move grows out of the last and the closure (the carousel’s first spin and her renewed promise to carry wonder forward) lands clearly on the page. The cost—tears, the weight of regret, and a commitment to carry it rather than escape it—is legible and integrated with the premise. Some beats feel slightly repetitive in how they restate the same emotional state, but the closure itself is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain—enter terminal → study conduits → redirect flows → partial resurrection → beacon—is coherent and easy to follow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the terminal moves from dead shell to humming beacon, and her stance toward hope crystallizes. Yet escalation is smooth and nearly frictionless; no beat genuinely complicates or threatens failure, which softens the sense of cost. The structure is solid but too safe for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a simple accumulative structure: he arrives at the sanctuary, recalls the origin of the dream, makes the clock, and internalizes a new stance, with clear orientation throughout. Closure is solid as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream moves from burden to “warm ember,” and the completed clock plus single chime give a legible before/after. However, the exact repetition of “He recalled the night he first imagined the memory‑counting clock...” reads like a structural error, and the causality between crystal guidance and emotional resolution is more implied than dramatized. Still, the drive lens (accumulative, interior) holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: barge → lock incident → dawn realization → ongoing vow, with a clear before/after shift toward committed truth-seeking. Causality is light but intact (the sundial-guided repair opens the lock and symbolically “unlocks” his insight). Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of time and truth, but the lack of substantive resistance or consequence keeps the change somewhat low-stakes. Orientation (where/when/who) is clean from the outset and the frame doesn’t fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece functions well as an accumulative/lyric scene: arrival → decoding rope → fulgurite activation → vow and ongoing ritual constitute a coherent progression. Causality is clean and orientation is immediate (who/where/what he’s doing), and the closure beat—his settled, costly endurance—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The main limitation is that the global drive remains gently textural; options never truly narrow or complicate, so the cost feels conceptual more than narratively earned.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece reads as an accumulative, lyric scene: he enters the garden, activates the thread, gathers whispers, revives the rose, and sets out on the path. Causality is gentle but coherent, with a resonant reconfiguration at the end as his task reframes from lonesome duty to guided journey. The cost—his endless, unfinished work—is implied rather than sharply foregrounded, keeping this strong but not exceptional at a top-tier standard.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the egg → decision to build cradle → hatching → transformation of palace and prince, with a legible before/after and a clear closure beat. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and the ending delivers a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration (the palace and kingdom reoriented toward beauty). However, most turns unfold without complication or setback; no tactic fails, and no option is forcibly foreclosed, so pressure never tightens meaningfully. Cost at closure is largely conceptual rather than dramatized, which limits impact at a “prestige” level.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative single scene from dusk through dawn, with the graft ritual as the spine and a clear before/after: Mira’s lineage weight “lifts” and the lagoon becomes a sanctuary. Causality is soft but coherent—her intention leads to the ritual, the coin “sings,” villagers respond, dawn seals the transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, and cost remains mostly implied (internal burden) rather than sharply dramatized. There are no orientation problems, but also no strong escalation beyond deepening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: geese pause → breadcrumb symbols → alcove trail → pedestal ritual → box opening → city renewal and internal shift. The piece functions on a mainly accumulative/textural lens but still respects because/therefore logic, and the closure presents a clear before/after for both city and Mara. That said, obstacles are minimal and success feels largely assured once the rules are stated; there’s no meaningful risk of failure or structural surprise. Closure is solid and legible but not rigorously tested.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: she arrives with the gear, activates it, the sonar expands, memories and wars surface, and she ends by seeding the gear and witnessing a new horizon. Causality is soft but legible—each move (“She placed the gear… and released a soft pulse” → echoes → realizations → burial) follows from the last under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: light without fire is redefined as memory, math, and love, with a visible before/after in the final filament. Stakes and costs are mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, but the structural arc holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—greenhouse evenings, spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, ribbon-heart, then monument—builds cleanly to a Conceptual Repricing of grief as tapestry rather than scar. Causality is coherent in a lyric sense: each introduced element (butterflies, ribbons, poems) returns with reweighted meaning at closure. The cost is subtle but present in Eliam’s surrender to a life shaped by others’ grief. The piece could reach higher if one or two turns carried sharper consequence or more acute jeopardy for his project or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: one main ritual scene with echoed “pauses” builds to a gentle RR-style closure where Mara accepts endless ongoing labor. Causality is simple but legible—she times her act to the pendulum pause, applies the rake handle, the bob responds, and the world subtly shifts. However, stakes and options never truly tighten; there’s no real prospect of failure or alternative path, so the before/after change feels more decorative than pressured. Closure exists but with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure is a single, coherent ritual scene, with the tapestry revelation and map discovery providing a legible middle turn and the “shape of intentions” realization functioning as a Conceptual Repricing closure. The causal chain is light but coherent for an accumulative/lyric piece: observe → decode tapestry → learn Marlowe’s truth → reframe intention as circle/seed. What’s missing is a clear sense of cost or constrained options—his success feels inevitable, not wrested from difficulty. Still, the before/after in knowledge is clean and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: king’s commission → modeling process → forecast → engineered response → transformed kingdom, with a legible before/after. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: by the end, modeling itself is framed as a world-inscribing act, reweighting the opening premise about mapping ignorance. However, much of the central action (e.g., the implementation of the plan and its risks) is summarized rather than staged, muting on-page cost. Structure is linear and coherent, but the crisis never feels genuinely precarious in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clean accumulative arc: broadcast arrives, Mara transcribes, the city gathers, the song is played, and the city is changed. Causality holds, and the closure—city learning that “even dust… could become a storyteller”—is legible as a resonant reconfiguration. However, turns are gentle; events feel more like a sequence of images than tightening dilemmas, and no beat materially forecloses options. The lack of real cost at the end keeps the structure from feeling truly decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, ritual-structured plot is coherent and closes cleanly with a resonant reconfiguration: safety is redefined as the willingness to feel, and the crystallized emotion remains as legacy. Causality is soft but legible—she enters, performs the ritual, the gallery responds, she leaves transformed—without dead patches or confusing jumps. However, the cost of the final shift is more implied than sharply dramatized, so the before/after line, while present, could be starker. The outside coda maintains continuity rather than adding a new decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: in one continuous reflective scene, the discovery and placement of the cog move the narrator from choosing between narratives to integrating them. Causality under a situational/accumulative lens is coherent—the cog syncing with the other gears precipitates the conceptual turn, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (embracing a “chorus of truths”). Orientation is solid from the start (who/where/when are clear), and the sewer → city-above contrast frames the ending. The main limitation is that the “agonizing” is summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation feels mostly intellectual rather than structurally tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: atmosphere and tension build toward the communal singing, followed by a quiet settling and a forward-leaning coda. Causality is intact—the teacher prepares, plays, invites, and the community softens—and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where a fragile new tradition begins. However, the arc is almost frictionless; no beat truly threatens failure, so the before/after division, while clear, lacks bite. The “weeks that followed” extension reinforces the drive but also diffuses immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: enter greenhouse → prepare broth/taste memories → alignment intensifies → seed is added → spores and transformed canopy → beacon-like closure. Causality is intact, with because/therefore links (broth as conduit → plants rewiring → spores integrating memories), and the alignment’s zenith provides a clear climactic beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the greenhouse becomes a beacon and the rebellion’s nature is redefined as pruning, not war. What’s missing at a higher level is a felt cost or serious risk to success; events unfold smoothly, so the before/after shift is more conceptual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: blackout → box → matchbox/riddle → key/compartment → revived tower → drone → echo insight → new ritual. Causality is intact and legible, with a clear before/after reconfiguration once “echo” is revealed. The key and drone arrivals are convenient but not illogical; stakes are modest and mostly conceptual. Closure as conceptual repricing (hives as pause, not loss) is on the page, though cost is soft and largely thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: bay → shop → shard → pier experiment → neighborhood response → conceptual reframing of the narrator’s role. Causality is soft but coherent—each step follows from the narrator’s curiosity and the shard’s introduced properties. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator reconceives themself as a catalyst and the town as sanctified by hush, with a before/after legible in how they now hear houses and streetlights. The cost of this shift (bearing the hush’s “weight”) is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the ending from feeling fully earned at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: the statue threads memory, revelations unfurl, the garden transforms. Causality is soft but legible—threading through the structural weakness leads to revelations and architectural change. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: certainty reweighted by nuance. The major limitation is the lack of a visible price or constrained choice at the end, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: base situation → years of equations → building the device → staircase’s “quiet rupture” → final chipped-face-up roll and repriced understanding. Causality is legible enough (his mathematical tinkering leads to the staircase’s shift), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing where the missed chance becomes stabilizing flaw, not target to erase. The cost is somewhat soft but present: he accepts “every step was both a cage and a key,” relinquishing the fantasy of fully reclaiming lost chances. A bit of “and-then” summary and low on-page friction keep it below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Mara’s nightly practice → paintings and notes as outreach → Jiro’s encounter → reaffirmed mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Jiro is moved by her work and Mara quietly recommits, establishing a before/after in the city’s recognition of kindness. Causality is gentle but intact; nothing crucial teleports or contradicts earlier beats. The cost and stakes remain small-scale and conceptual, which limits how forcefully the closure hits.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative, lyric arc: from frozen, traumatized grotto to reanimated amphitheater and legend, with clear before/after and a coherent closure image. Causality is present but soft—bread and lens together “therefore” thaw murals and doors—yet many beats are told in sweeping summary, so individual turns don’t fully land as scenes. Still, the closure unit (arts revived, legend established, dread reweighted into bittersweet acceptance) is legible and thematically consistent. The lack of on-page obstacles or reversals keeps the structure from feeling truly tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival → discovery of yoyo → deciphering → engine activation → lighthouse beacon → brief epilogue with the sailor. Closure is present—the lighthouse is transformed and the clock maker departs with his purpose fulfilled—but the path is almost frictionless, with no real setbacks or complicating turns. The late sailor shard is coherent as an echo, though it slightly diffuses the otherwise tight scene. Overall structure is sound but lacks a charged, costly inflection point.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a mostly clean causal chain: advisor’s instructions → swallowing the clasp → placing it on the horse → activating the dream-dictionary paradox → exposing and dissolving fear → the final bargain. Closure lands via a conceptual reconfiguration: fear’s “true shape” is exposed and Mara is offered the ongoing curse of luminance as a cost. Some mechanics (especially the dream dictionary’s power and the efficacy of a single word, “vanish”) feel convenient and under-grounded, softening the impact of the decisive change. Still, the before/after of the funhouse and Mara’s role in the economy of fear are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative/textural structure: reading clouds → building rhythm → orchard’s full resonance → quiet aftermath and departure. Cause-effect is coherent within the conceit (cloud shifts → musical shifts → environmental response), and the closure beat—a charged poise as he moves on—lands cleanly. That said, the escalation is primarily descriptive and conceptual, with minimal sense that options are narrowing or that any failure is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: whistle → attention of turtles/watchers → shell-language study → cracked mosaic → noon passage → contact → conceptual reframe. Structure is linear and legible with one central throughline and a clear closure beat in her realization about the “true lost expedition.” Fantasy mechanisms (map glowing, tunnel opening at noon) arrive as mild conveniences but don’t break logic under an accumulative/lyric lens. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—she inherits responsibility and knowledge but faces little concrete resistance en route.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story has a clean causal spine—arrival, search, discovery, reading, and transformation—anchored in one continuous scene. Closure is present: the station and ivy shift as the noble lie conceptually dissolves and truth is “rescued.” However, there is little genuine complication or narrowing of options; no setup is meaningfully endangered, and the solution arrives as soon as he reads the letter. The change feels more like an inevitable ritual than a pressured resolution with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean: the bridge rises, she crosses to the pavilion, performs her ritual of note-placement, vows to return, and departs under a reweighted understanding. Causality in a literal sense is minimal but coherent and appropriate for an accumulative/lyric piece; each beat deepens the same drive rather than introducing new complications. Closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the pavilion’s “interlaced absence” becoming woven into her own story. The cost is subtle—her commitment to keep being drawn deeper into such ruins—but present.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain—research in blackout → hypothesis of sacrificial flood → council appeal → funded lights → discovery of vault and charter—is clean and legible. Closure is solid: the city reinterprets its past and chooses protection, a clear before/after conceptual shift. However, every institutional and physical obstacle yields easily (the council agrees at once, the vault opens without real difficulty), so turns lack friction and cost. Structure is strong but feels more like a graceful outline of successes than a pressured plot.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: the ritual of recording, polishing, folding, and release builds toward the basilica’s transformation and his partial relief. Causality is coherent within the magical logic, and the ending offers a clear resonant reconfiguration as the basilica ascends/descends and his grief “eases, not disappears.” However, the piece remains essentially one extended movement without a distinct mid-beat turn that sharply reconfigures options or stakes. Closure works, but the arc feels more like a beautifully sustained mood than a fully tightened narrative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece holds as a single continuous scene with clean causal progression: calibrating instruments → revealing fissure → contact → metaphysical realization. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing where the “hunt” redefines from external site to internal state, and the observatory’s exhale plus the shard-in-hand crystallize a before/after. However, escalation is more of a smooth swell of imagery than a distinctly stepped pressure curve; there’s no strong complication between discovery and merger. Structure is coherent and satisfying but not maximally tightened for this market.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Lira arrives, follows the star trails with the drone, activates the chip, and has a realization; the observatory’s transformation provides a modest but coherent closure. However, the “mission” is fulfilled almost without friction, and the result feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won outcome. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—re-seeing the observatory as a living archive and belonging as a frequency—but the cost of this shift is minimal. Structurally sound but not yet at elite intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear: terrace → summons/job → boat → shore → carvings → revelation → return to terrace and new resolve. Structure is linear and easy to follow, and the drive lens feels primarily accumulative/textural—the journey deepens a preexisting moral pressure rather than turning on sharp reversals. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: he reweighs his trade and commits to honesty, with the watch hand as a small decisive act. The main limitation is that everything unfolds with little friction, so the decisive moment never feels truly endangered.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story tracks as a single, coherent causal scene: arrival → apology and offering of the box → mutual decision → release of prisoners → inner relief. Closure is solid; both the external situation (prisoners freed) and the protagonist’s stance (guilt eased) change on the page. Escalation is modest but present, moving from tense stand‑off to commitment, with no major causality breaks. Minor world inconsistencies around moon phases don’t derail structure but do nick believability slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is linear and coherent: arrival at the pier, recollection of past collapse, launch, and emotional reconfiguration by nightfall, all under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the “flickering” faith settling into a “steady ember” with regrets still present but reweighted as manageable cost. Causality is modest but intact; each physical move (stepping onto the pier, lifting the kayak, following the utility poles) flows into deepened reflection. The main limitation is the lack of any real complication or narrowing of options beyond memory, so the plot remains relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain (procedure → clues on the lake → crate/baseball → ad → tunnel → mirror → return to lake and sacrifice) is clean and easy to follow. The piece hits a clear closure beat as the narrator reinterprets their quest from erasing the past to using it as a compass, with the toss of the baseball as a decisive act. Stakes remain internal and low-intensity—there’s little sense of what happens if they fail beyond abstract moral loss. Structure is solid for a single-quest vignette, but the lack of real setbacks or complications keeps it from feeling fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The structure is clean: preparation → ritual → manifestation → transformed status quo, with a clear before/after and decisive change. Causality is intact and easy to follow, and the closure—her becoming guardian with Arion restored—is legible. However, the path from intention to success is almost frictionless; nothing meaningfully complicates or redirects her course, so the climax feels inevitable more than earned. The cost of the transformation is conceptually present but never pressures tactics or options along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean and linear: the clasp unfastened → shards → vapor → staircase → blossom → droplet → twins, with a legible before/after once time is reclaimed. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural with causal links functioning smoothly inside the ritual frame. Closure is present and coherent—the saucer heals, the twins calm, and she departs changed—but the price of success is understated and obstacles are minimal. No orientation problems, but the path from setup to solution feels somewhat preordained rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal line is clean: Nara uses Kwan Yin’s tear and her joy-induced lightness to stitch the veil until the locked dimension opens, then she steps through and seals it with compassion. Structure is straightforward, with one continuous arc from drifting ship to garden dimension and a clear before/after. Closure lands—the ship is left behind, the dimension is now open—but the process feels preordained, with little sense that failure was a live option or that choices meaningfully altered tactics. The drive reads as mostly accumulative/textural, and that lens holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece reads as an accumulative/textural design: Mara’s detour, the prophecy, the volcano, and the fisherman accrete toward a conceptual repricing of her life’s work. Causality is broadly coherent (detour → jar trembles → glowing sand → fisherman → ancestral prophecy), but stakes stay abstract and there is no concrete obstacle or dilemma to structure rising pressure. Closure is legible—Mara reinterprets her path as destiny and carries that forward—but the transformation carries minimal cost beyond a renewed sense of purpose. The story feels more like a vignette of revelation than a fully pressurized narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent and easy to follow: rumor → sundial code → cradle activation → garrison’s mental shift, with a solid on-page closure where the fort’s rhythm has changed. Structurally it’s one continuous, accumulative operation rather than a scene with turns; that’s acceptable, but there’s almost no complication or setback, so tension never meaningfully tightens. The blackout and coded sundial are set up and paid off, and the final image of a new whispered rhythm offers a clear before/after. The main weakness is the near-frictionless execution of a premise that implies higher risk and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual with the rocks and dust slowly builds to the violet flame and conceptual shift about pattern malleability. Causality is legible—she arranges sequences, dust responds, flame ignites, and the universe’s “rules” are reweighted—yielding a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The structure is essentially one continuous scene without confusing time or space jumps, and the before/after (curse as prison vs compass) is intelligible. Stakes and costs remain more metaphysical than narratively pressured, which keeps this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: ascent, ritual with timer, storm response, and then mythic expansion into a communal practice. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: scars are re-understood as map/terrain and the observatory becomes a generational site of compassion. Causality is soft but coherent (storm → ritual → timer ringing → transformation of storm and myth). The main limitation is that the decisive change feels more narrated than experienced; cost and before/after are more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure—duel followed by an evening return—reads cleanly and the causal chain is legible: sundial → duel → alignment with needle card → later mapping of the overture. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: questions literally become mapped “destinations” for future travelers. However, the drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural; tension and cost remain low, so the final shift feels elegant but not especially consequential. Nothing in the setup is violated, but little is truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal spine is clean in an accumulative/lyric way: coffee tin → manifesto → rebuilding shelves → seeds/garden → travelers and ongoing resistance. Closure arrives via a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing—the library has become a living sanctuary and beacon—but the shift feels largely inevitable rather than contested. There is no decisive turn where options narrow or a real alternative path is foreclosed on the page, so the before/after is thematic more than dramatically earned. Still, the patterning is coherent and the final image clearly reweights what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure follows an accumulative/lyric drive: images and motifs (station, arbor, reels, clock, compasses) build toward the encore and the clock’s final tick. Causality is soft but legible: his creativity with film reels enables escape; waiting for night ties to the plan; the encore reconfigures fate and time. Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration—time/fate slightly altered, the clock satisfied and stopped. The stakes and costs remain more conceptual than dramatized, which limits the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: clear goal, ritual-like process through dreams, and a concrete closure when the seed sprouts and the ridge “exhales.” Causality holds under a Hybrid/accumulative lens—the interpretive work in the dream realm leads directly to the awakening. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a mild Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is mostly conceptual and anticipatory; nothing significant is lost or imperiled beyond the voiced fear. The piece could reach higher if the monsoon deadline or interpretive task produced a sharper on-page constraint or near-failure before success.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative ritual: tutor + compass + knots gradually reweight the island’s sorrow, culminating in the compass settling and the island’s emotional release. Causality is soft but coherent under a textural lens—the ritual instructions and knots correlate with the compass’s responses and the island’s transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the island’s sorrow is conceptually lightened and the tutor’s role crystallizes as “keeper of tides.” Stakes and costs remain mostly conceptual, but the before/after is legible.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative summarizes "weeks" of progress rather than dramatizing a specific scene, diluting tension and violating the single-scene/two-shard scope default. Closure relies on a low-cost success where the environment cooperates perfectly with the hypothesis, lacking a decisive on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successes without obstacles, meaningful reversals, or causality gaps; the frost maps work perfectly. Closure is tidy and didactic ("every ending would birth a new beginning"), lacking the "felt cost" or resistance required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of instant success without complications, ending in a summary ("In the weeks that followed") that deflates immediate tension. Closure is achieved through a time-jump summary rather than a decisive on-page moment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression with no causal complications or doubts. Spatial logic is incoherent; Marlow’s boots "echo" underwater, yet he later finds a "slice of air," creating a confused physical reality that undermines the inciting action. Closure is achieved, but it feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative operates as a summary montage spanning months ("three winters," "first month") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default and diluting tension. The core causal logic—that a starving, sanctioned community can anonymously fill a pantry with abundance—breaks suspension of disbelief, and the ending resolves without a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of instant success without causality born of friction; the protagonist encounters no resistance, and the resolution provides "symmetric satisfaction" where a complex problem is solved by magic without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of executed intent without resistance; the plan works exactly as designed, leading to a low-stakes outcome. The closure relies on a "success procedural" beat—the magic functions, the photos fade, and the protagonist feels affirmed—lacking the necessary cost or decisive change required for a high-band score. Causality is soft, driven by atmospheric assertions rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.4)
    The plot moves on rails of convenience with no causal friction; the puzzle is solved instantly via a convenient memory, and the "guardians" mentioned never appear to test the protagonist. The ending relies on magical realism (instant seed growth, walls crumbling on cue) that breaks the established grit of the opening, lacking a logical cost for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative fails to form a coherent scene, relying instead on a montage summary of habitual actions ("She returned to the greenhouse at night," "She returned to the forge nightly"). This violation of the single-scene/two-shard scope prevents causal pressure from accumulating and dissolves the timeline into a generalized synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, dream-logic progression where obstacles are immediately resolved by external assistance rather than protagonist agency. Orientation is contradictory, with "golden sunset" and "moonlight" occurring simultaneously without establishing a magical rule-set. Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist simply changes her mind without paying a visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear sequence of tasks but lacks causal drive; the climax (panels flickering to life) feels like an unearned coincidence or atmospheric decoration rather than a result of the protagonist's agency. The closure relies on a stated realization without a logical mechanism connecting the glassblowing to the control room's reactivation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is governed by dream-logic that breaks suspension of disbelief (a child's cast inside a shell thread; constellations spelling a name backwards). The resolution is a Deus Ex Machina where a magic voice and potion instantly dissolve the central conflict without cost. The narrative relies on arbitrary connections that lack motivation or grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative proceeds sequentially based on prompt cues rather than causal pressure; the star fades, so he works; dawn comes, so he vanishes. Closure is a "soft reset" where the character dissolves into the air, bypassing any tangible consequence or earned resolution to the problem of mapping the infinite.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear success chain with no resistance; the robot attempts a complex metaphysical task and succeeds instantly with no "try-fail" cycle. The "looped timelines" logic acts as a convenience tool (magic A solves B) rather than a causal mechanism, and the closure returns to the status quo without a felt price or meaningful change. Causality is replaced by technobabble ("projecting memory... onto ice").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where a magical tool instantly resolves a complex social problem without complication or sacrifice. The ending offers a "happily ever after" summary that explains away the conflict rather than dramatizing a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative operates on dream logic rather than causal progression; events happen because the atmosphere demands them, not because of the protagonist's agency meeting resistance. The "luck gauge" is introduced but has no causal impact on the plot. Closure is weak because the "triumph" is handed to him by a talking garden without any risk of failure or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate gratification: goal conceived, lever pulled, success achieved. There is no causality of resistance; the universe yields instantly to the protagonist's hypothesis without complication or cost. The lack of an "earned" transition renders the closure—a symmetric satisfaction where everything works perfectly—hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where convenience drives causality (e.g., water damage perfectly matching the program). The resolution relies on a pathetic fallacy—the rain ceasing exactly when the song ends—which feels contrived. Closure is achieved through a "gift" from the environment rather than a decisive change or sacrifice by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear healing arc (Resonant Reconfiguration) that is legible but low on causal friction. The resolution—measuring the lie to relieve the burden—feels like a "soft reset" where performing a ritual mechanically solves an emotional problem without a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the central mechanism of the plot—deriving a numeric pattern from radio static to weigh a ghost—lacks intelligible causality or established story logic. The closure (leaving the wheel) functions as Earned Stasis, but the decision feels arbitrary because the cost is purely metaphorical ("swallowed truth settle like a quiet prayer") rather than a concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear A-to-B path with no causal friction; obstacles explicitly remove themselves ("stone floor softened," "walls narrowing as if... breathing" but he slips through easily). The ending is a "soft reset" where the character feels better without paying a visible cost or undergoing a structural change.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story relies on a linear "success" sequence devoid of causal friction, ending in a fairytale summary ("From that day forward...") rather than a scene-based closure. The resolution dissolves into long-term exposition, avoiding the required on-page decisive change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, resistance-free path where clues immediately yield solutions without complication (tapestry matches diary, diary points to room, room confirms theory). The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a tidy wrap-up that validates the protagonist's initial guess without cost or twist. Closure is mechanically achieved but lacks narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is severely comprised by "dream logic" that lacks grounding; the mechanism of aligning a lighthouse lantern with a telegraph to embed microdots in dough is physically incoherent and unexplained. The narrative relies on summary and convenient success rather than cause-and-effect progression. The ending ("strangers woke... lives rewired") is a grand conceptual leap unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, frictionless path where the protagonist succeeds completely without adaptation or sacrifice. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction"—the problem is solved exactly as planned—missing the required felt or conceptual cost. The causality is abstract, relying on assertion rather than demonstrated mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear enactment of a magical ritual rather than a plot with causality and consequence. The potential tension of "exhaustion" is introduced as a scaffold phrase but dropped immediately. The resolution (becoming the conductor) feels inevitable and unearned because the magic system creates no friction or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot operates on dream logic with a linear progression that lacks causal turning points or meaningful setbacks. The closure—dissolving into light—reads as a "soft reset" that bypasses the established stakes without a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a "soft reset" pattern where a magical tool solves the protagonist's internal problem with no on-page cost or complication. The ending relies on a summary of success ("she smiled," "numbness dissolve like frost") rather than a decisive change with visible consequences. Causality is mechanistic: action A yields result B without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative suffers from a significant causality gap regarding the central prop: Elara finds a sealed pigeon tube and "intuits" its purpose, then deposits it in a shaft to deliver "recorded truth." It is unclear whether she added her own notes or is blindly smuggling unknown cargo; this ambiguity dissolves the logic of the resolution. The ending offers a low-cost, convenient solution to a city-wide quarantine.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative arc to a "conceptual repricing" closure that feels complete but low-stakes. The "transformation" beat triggers a jarring tense shift ("completes... uncorked") that disrupts the causal chain and orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where causality is weak; tunnels are revealed "by uncovering layers" simply because the author asserts it. The "impossible choices" are presented as lists of disconnected options (fireflies vs. lantern) without established stakes or setup, making the progression feel arbitrary rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear success sequence lacking a decisive change with visible cost; the "chronic hush" is lifted without resistance or complication. Closure relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem simply dissolves into a serene, happy ending, failing the requirement for a felt or conceptual price. The plot reads as a healing vignette rather than a story with causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural vignette rather than a story with a structural arc; events unfold without resistance or causal turns. Closure is merely the cessation of the task, lacking a decisive change or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of serendipitous events with no causal friction; obstacles are nonexistent, and the resolution relies on a montage of summary ("next morning," "next full moon"). The inciting incident (the letter) leads instantly to a solution without complication, resulting in a fable-like structure that lacks narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path without causal friction or obstruction; the goal is achieved because the plot demands it. The ending relies on a summary time-jump ("One dawn") that breaks the scene anchor to deliver a didactic conclusion rather than an earned on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on "magic wand" solutions, where the pendant conveniently creates bridges, stairs, and resolves the climax without effort. The resolution is a "soft reset" that restores the city and leaves the protagonist unharmed, resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" rather than a meaningful change or paid price. The causality is driven by dream-logic rather than character action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions without causal friction or obstruction. The resolution (understanding loss as transformation) is achieved through a magical technology that works perfectly on the first try, lacking the felt cost required for a high-band closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure with no complications; the equipment works perfectly after years of dormancy. Closure is achieved through a magical "fix" that grants the protagonist's desire without visible cost or trade-off, resulting in a low-stakes "mission complete" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: observation, intervention, success, and repetition. The ending fails to provide a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; instead, it offers a summary of success ("nursery... humming with renewed vigor") and a promise of future repetition. The orientation is clear, but the lack of causal friction turns the plot into an anecdote rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a linear fetch-quest structure where a magical object and a disembodied voice conveniently resolve the central conflict. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist solves the world's problem and immediately regains her inspiration, negating the stated cost of the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story dissolves into a summary montage ("The story... spreads," "The next day") that violates the single-scene scope without earning the structural shift. Causality is replaced by a sequence of unearned positive outcomes, lacking a decisive change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure violates the short-story scope by jumping from a specific night ("Night fell") to a summary of weeks ("Days turned into weeks") and then a new incident ("One evening"), dissipating narrative tension. The ending initiates a new plot (the sloop journey) rather than resolving the central tension of the harbor scene. Causality is soft and dream-like; events happen because the ritual demands it, not because of character agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "corridor run" structure where the protagonist encounters a series of unlocked doors without obstacles or setbacks. The resolution relies on a magical object functioning exactly as expected (deus ex machina) rather than protagonist ingenuity or sacrifice. There is no legible cost to the character's success, making the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of automated success; the magic tile resolves the goal (sculpting reflection) without obstruction or failure risk. Closure is a soft realization ("not a sound... but a feeling") that feels unearned because the protagonist faced no meaningful causal pressure or trade-off to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is linear and lacks significant obstacles; the protagonist moves from A to B to C without genuine complication. The closure relies on an "explain-everything" realization delivered by a secondary figure (the twin) rather than a hard-won insight. The "spatial mutiny" provides visual flavor but no structural resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear procedure (wait, cast spell, succeed) with no causal reversals or obstacles within the scene. The resolution relies on a "magic feather" device that dissolves bureaucratic problems off-page, violating the requirement for on-page closure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative functions as a static vignette rather than a story with causal progression; events unfold chronologically (night to dawn) but lack a tightening of stakes. The closure is a summary realization ("histories were not lies but bridges") that feels unearned because no opposing force or dilemma challenged this view earlier. The drive lens is Accumulative, but the accumulation does not build pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression: find object, use object, accept role. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible but feels unearned because the "poison" label functions as a convenient magical lens without exacting a cost or forcing a difficult trade-off. Causality relies on the arbitrary mechanics of the prop rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative relies on dream-logic and convenience ("as if the shell itself were a key") rather than established causality or agency. The resolution is a philosophical summary ("riddle was not a puzzle") that offers no narrative consequence or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative acts as a high-level synopsis or fable rather than a short story, summarizing weeks of action instead of dramatizing a specific scene. Crucial beats—the reorganization effort and the confrontation with investors—are glossed over in summary, stripping the narrative of immediate causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is linear and lacks causal tension; the protagonist faces no obstacles or meaningful reversals. Closure is undermined by a logical contradiction: the protagonist mourns the grain's inevitable destruction/vanishing while simultaneously packing it "safely" into a canister, confusing the stakes of the "last record."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies on a fundamental causality break: a blind protagonist uses a visual method (light refraction) to perform the climax repair. The narrative lacks a functional drive lens, offering only a low-stakes procedural task that succeeds without cost, complication, or meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative logic collapses at the climax; the mechanism of using a radio transmitter to amplify a visual water pattern by pressing a dog-eared book against glass is incoherent even by magical realist standards. The sequence of events is linear and lacks a decisive turn or complication, reading more like a checklist of interactions than a causal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression of success with no inciting disruption to the protagonist’s ability (the ruin exists, but he fixes it instantly). The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved exactly as planned without cost or complication. The causality is purely magical ("he tuned, it fixed") rather than driven by narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.5)
    Major causality break: the vial "slipped... landing on the altar" and "exploded outward," yet immediately appears "in her satchel" on the surface without retrieval. The ending contradicts the premise: a rare, legendary vial becomes an infinite daily supply ("laying a fresh crystal perfume vial"). The bioluminescent fish spelling out the plot keyword "unsnarl" breaks narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality is nonexistent; the lattice functions as a "magic feather" that resolves all obstacles instantly. A severe editing error repeats the phrase "through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" verbatim in adjacent sentences, shattering immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.0)
    The piece fails the core requirement of a dramatized scene, functioning instead as a synopsis or legend summary spanning "lifetimes" and "countless suns." There is no grounded "now" where cause and effect play out; the closure is narrated from a distance rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success without causal friction; the obstacles (old guilds) crumble under "soft insistence" rather than active engagement. The ending relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where the antagonists appear solely to kneel and validate the protagonist, rendering the resolution unearned. Causality is flattened by the lack of meaningful setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, friction-free "happy path" where the protagonist succeeds at every step without setbacks. The ending dissolves into summary ("In the weeks that followed"), bypassing the requirement for a specific, dramatized closure beat with visible cost. The "cost proof test" fails completely as the restoration requires no sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a procedural linearity where a ritual is performed without obstruction, lacking a causal spine or genuine pressure. The closure is merely the completion of a task; there is no "decisive change" or felt cost, as the outcome is assured from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on a "magic object solves the plot" structure where the candle dictates the truth without protagonist deduction or risk. The ending lacks a decisive change with felt cost; the courier simply takes the solution away, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction ending where the problem dissolves without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic path with no causal disruption or cost; the sole obstacle (the wind) is resolved immediately by the spirits, not the protagonist's agency. Closure is a "soft reset" where grief simply evaporates without a visible or felt price paid for the healing. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction rather than a reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic path without causal pressure or obstacles; the solution (magic coral) is applied without established rules or cost. The ending relies on a "soft reset" where the trauma is simply grafted away, lacking a Decisive Change or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative operates as a summary or fable rather than a dramatized scene, collapsing time and effort into abstract descriptions ("The day stretched, though time felt folded"). Causality is weak; the "knowledge network" acts as a deus ex machina that solves the technical challenge instantly without process or error. Closure is purely additive, lacking the requisite cost or trade-off required for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of magical interactions leading to an unearned epiphany ("she realized that..."). The closure relies on an abstract realization without a causal chain of pressure or a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks genuine obstacles; the protagonist succeeds in his goal without setback or tactical adjustment. Closure is a utopian summary of success that fails to exact the required felt or conceptual cost. The causality is soft, relying on magical coincidence rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, fable-like progression with no causal friction or resistance. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the universe grants a "blossom armistice" without the protagonist paying a visible price or making a difficult trade-off. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned, lacking the "Decisive Change" required for literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative operates as a static vignette or ritual loop rather than a causal story; the arrival of the traveler is a coincidence that complicates nothing and resolves instantly with a gift. Closure returns to the status quo without a "decisive change" or a felt price, making the ending feel circular rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where obstacles are immediately resolved by the magical tool without tactical shifts or setbacks. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where every problem is fixed perfectly with no visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where technology instantaneously solves a complex political and social conflict without cost or negotiation. The causal chain is broken by the fantastical leap that glue residue refracts light into binary code, which then translates into an "algorithm of empathy." This "explain-everything" ending provides symmetric satisfaction but lacks earned narrative stakes or logical progression. The conflict dissolves by fiat rather than through character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative operates as a summary of "weeks" rather than a dramatized scene with causal progression. There is no distinct inciting incident or structural tightening; the resolution ("attic filled with a soft chorus") arrives through procedural description rather than earned struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot lacks causal tension; the protagonist overcomes the maze solely through convenient "intuition" that functions as a magic key, bypassing any struggle or cost. The narrative arc is linear and predictable, culminating in a resolution where the stakes dissolve rather than resolve through hard choice. The "butterfly effect" backstory is stated but not integrated into the causal chain of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "success procedural" structure where every action immediately yields the desired result without complication. The ending offers Symmetric Satisfaction—a "soft reset" where the protagonist gains total understanding and belonging with no visible cost or sacrifice. The drive lens is nominally accumulative, but the lack of friction makes the progression feel automatic rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "lock-and-key" structure where the protagonist encounters a series of obstacles that yield immediately to her tool without complication. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the solution (putting the seed in the fissure) perfectly fixes the problem with no lingering cost or trade-off. Causality is soft; the magic operates on dream logic that is convenient rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure of a successful performance without causal pressure or a turning point. The ending is a "soft reset" (the tide washes the ink away, he vanishes) which fails the closure requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The sequence relies on convenient serendipity (the ink forming an X) rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without significant causal pressure or cost; the ritual succeeds simply because Lira performs it. The connection between the "nostalgia ban" and her "elective exile" is loose, failing to charge the climax with the necessary weight. The ending relies on symmetric satisfaction—a perfect completion of the task—rather than a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story follows a linear "arrival-ritual-epiphany" structure that lacks causality or obstruction; the ending is a "soft reset" where the character simply decides to feel better. There is no Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, only a passive observation that leads to a declared balance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear procession without obstacles, lacking a true inciting incident or rising action on the page. Causality is governed by dream logic ("box turned whole" by "collective understanding") rather than character agency or consequence. The closure relies on a magical fix that resolves the premise without visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on dream-logic where metaphorical actions (decorations) yield physical results (altitude) without established ground rules, reducing causality to magical convenience. The ending provides a "Conceptual Repricing" of the gauge, but it feels unearned because there is no visible cost or obstacle overcome—success proceeds linearly from the first attempt to the last. The grammatical error ("knowing that revitalize the community's faith required") disrupts the causal flow description.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Finding the instructional diaries and film negative in the fireplace upon arrival is a convenient coincidence that undercuts causality; the summary ending diffuses the scene's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks a causal spine, functioning instead as a linear sequence of successful actions that fulfill the premise without complication. The ending offers no decisive change or recontextualization, merely confirming the initial state of "calm" success without generating narrative drive or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: Lira writes, chieftains arrive, they agree immediately. There is no causal struggle or pivot point where failure is possible; the resolution feels like a "soft reset" where deep-seated "forever war" grudges evaporate instantly upon hearing flowery language. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story dissolves into a summary coda ("In the weeks that followed") that mechanically verifies the plot's outcome, stripping the climax of resonance. This "explain-everything" ending resolves ambiguity with scientific confirmation rather than trusting the closure image to stand on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where magical actions (untangling threads) yield immediate success without complication or setback. Causality is governed by dream logic rather than mechanical or character-driven consequence. The ending offers closure but feels unearned due to the absence of obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative is a static vignette of reflection rather than a causal sequence; the protagonist enters, thinks, and leaves without facing opposition. The closure relies on a declared "epiphany" that feels unearned because no prior options were foreclosed and no cost was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative is a linear vignette with no causal drive or decisive change; the ending merely continues the initial state without cost or reconfiguration. The "closure" is an external event (butterflies passing) rather than a structural shift in the protagonist's stance or options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where intentions immediately yield results. The coda with the traveler acts as an unearned victory lap that diffuses the ending's focus and lowers the sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path with no meaningful resistance or causal turns; the protagonist performs a task and the world instantly cooperates. The closure is a "soft reset" where magic fixes the problem without any visible or felt cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis rather than a dramatized story, summarizing a discovery, a ritual, and a lifetime of consequences in a few paragraphs. Causality is absent; the ritual succeeds simply because Nabu performs it, with no obstacles or risk of failure. The ending relies on a "happily ever after" summary ("city’s markets thrummed") rather than an on-page closure unit with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a magical solution that resolves the central problem instantly without struggle, resulting in a flat, repetitive structure (monks cured, then wanderer cured). A logic break occurs when Mara whispers instructions in a sanctuary explicitly defined as "soundless" and echo-absorbing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural structure where the protagonist’s plan works immediately without complication, error, or adaptation. Closure is achieved through a "success" state that imposes no legible cost or sacrifice on the page, failing the requirement for a Decisive Change with price. The drive lens is ritualistic but lacks the friction or causal branching needed for a compelling plot.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of low-stakes actions without a decisive turning point or felt cost. The resolution—mending the eyes—is achieved too easily via "forgotten bag contents" and a sudden idea, lacking causal friction. The breach of contract is backstory that does not pressure the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a checklist trajectory rather than a causal chain; the shift to the "bathroom" is a jarring, unmotivated pivot solely to satisfy the prompt. Closure relies on a magical exposition dump (the mirror vision) that resolves the central mystery without requiring the protagonist to navigate a genuine dilemma or pay a concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no meaningful reversals or orientation debt, but it lacks a closure unit with felt cost. The time traveler’s intervention deflates tension by confirming success before the resolution lands. The "self-fulfilling" nature of the ending feels circular rather than earning a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative proceeds via "and then" sequencing without causal necessity; the protagonist overcomes obstacles like the ink river effortlessly through magical solutions that lack setup or cost. The resolution is unearned, relying on a linear fetch-quest structure that fails to generate tension or meaningful narrative turns.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot is a linear procedural lacking tension; the protagonist identifies and enacts the solution immediately without obstruction. Closure is a "soft reset" where the problem vanishes, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to mark a genuine narrative change.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution track without meaningful complications or twists. The resolution is a "soft reset" where the magical object perfectly solves the conflict without requiring a sacrifice or trade-off from the protagonist. Closure is achieved through symmetric satisfaction—the return of the status quo—rather than a decisive change or recontextualization.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where the central goal (rekindling) is achieved mid-story without resistance or setbacks. The ending is additive—a caravan arrives to validate the success—rather than a resolution of tension with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative lacks causality or resistance; the protagonist’s conjecture is immediately confirmed by the environment without testing or failure. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the sun rises and the theme is summarized, lacking the required Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear vignette of successful actions without causal complication or opposition. The ending—a vow to return—functions as a soft reset rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive; events unfold sequentially without the protagonist's intervention altering the trajectory. The resolution—a spontaneous de-escalation between the clans—feels convenient and unearned, lacking the required "felt or conceptual cost" for meaningful closure. The timeline is murky, jumping from a "meeting expected at dawn" to an immediate resolution under the stars.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure works well for the concept, guiding the reader through the ritual of the ascent and harvest. Closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the bunker's atmosphere, though the "felt cost" is mild—the physical strain is mentioned but doesn't feel like a true trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a functional drive lens; events occur as a static sequence of rituals without accumulating pressure or causal linkage. Orientation is fundamentally broken by the spatial contradiction of Lira guiding a gondola while perched on a "terrace" that floats separately, yet acts as the vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.6)
    The plot is a friction-free walkthrough where obstacles yield immediately to the protagonist's presence (murals shiver, fissures open). The closure offers symmetric satisfaction with no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change or reconfiguration with price.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual progression but relies on dream logic that obscures causality; specifically, the literalization of "burning bridges" confuses the spatial reality of the hallway. While closure is technically achieved through the crossing, the lack of grounded resistance makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure lands on a "happily ever after" with no visible cost; the protagonist gains diamonds and resolves debt without sacrifice. The appearance of the former accountant is a convenient coincidence that strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist wants something and immediately gets it without complication or cost. The causal link between the gramophone's "standing waves" and the audible wood grain cipher relies on convenient magical realism that solves the plot instantly. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—a perfect reward for a simple task—lacking the requisite sense of risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "find key, open door" structure without causal friction or genuine opposition. The knight encounters no setbacks; the environment yields immediately to his actions, resulting in a low-tension sequence. The ending relies on a "soft reset" of reality rather than a closure unit earned through cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a "magic wand" solution where the button resolves the central lack without causal effort. The potential conflict with the supervisor dissolves immediately, leading to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending that feels unearned and devoid of structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative trajectory is linear and lacks causal resistance; Mara encounters no active obstacles, making the outcome feel inevitable and unearned. The sudden time jump ("Weeks later") in the final paragraph dissipates tension and functions as an unnecessary epilogue rather than part of a cohesive scene structure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot is a linear sequence of events with weak causality; the "prophecy" dissolves without resistance or complication. The ending is a soft reset with no felt cost, relying on "magic art" logic where playing the instrument solves the problem instantly. The stakes are telescopic—world-ending danger resolved by a simple action.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure of unmitigated success: she seeks, she finds, she builds, it works. The closure lacks a sense of cost or "before/after" contrast, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than a decisive change earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest lacking obstacles; the protagonist succeeds simply by walking forward to a destination. Closure relies on a "soft reset" where a magical inscription explicitly explains the theme, lacking any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    Causality is weak, relying on unexplained magic where whispering a name instantly repairs metal without labor or process. The logic breaks when she measures the "temperature of the fire that had not yet been lit," a physical impossibility that undermines the "factually mystical" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory (entry, tool use, realization, resolution) lacking causal tightening or reversal. The resolution—telling a simple joke to instantly heal centuries of grief—feels unearned and convenient, bypassing necessary narrative friction. While closure is technically achieved through the healing of the spirits, the absence of obstacles makes the ending feel inevitable rather than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where an internal epiphany ("the equation") acts as a magical switch to resolve the external threat, bypassing genuine causal resistance. The ending feels unearned, as the forest simply surrenders its nature to a whispered sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.1)
    The structure is a linear procedural: task accepted, task performed, task finished. While the closure unit (the release of the memory) is legible, it lacks causal friction or the risk of failure. The narrative moves smoothly from A to B without the pressure required to make the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on unearned "technobabble" (connecting a mechanical mainspring to an electric circuit to organize dust) to resolve the plot. Additionally, spatial logic fractures: a "broken glass ceiling revealing the sky" contradicts the subsequent climb to an "attic hatch" above the same space.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows dream-logic where actions (tracing frost) lead to high-concept outcomes without clear causality or mechanical friction. Closure is achieved, but the "rupture" lacks a felt cost, as the destruction immediately resolves into a superior, magical state ("living lattice") without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a high-level summary spanning decades and seasons, violating the short story scope of a continuous scene or braided shards. The climax (the recitation and resolution) is reported rather than shown, and the "explain-everything" ending resolves complex social strife with a magical wave of the hand.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion arc with no meaningful reversals; the "philosopher's stone chip" acts as a convenient solution that dissolves the problem instantly. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the repair succeeds perfectly with no felt or conceptual cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change with price.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression with low stakes and no significant reversals or complications. The closure relies on a conceptual repricing ("not a location but a state") that feels convenient and unearned given the lack of prior narrative pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative suffers from significant causality breaks; the inciting incident ("GPS fails") implies a survival crisis or disorientation that is immediately abandoned for an artistic reverie without explanation. The ending contradicts the middle (the archway becomes her studio, yet she leaves it to return to a "workshop" in the final paragraph). The closure is unearned, resting on a montage of success without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance: the protagonist arrives, performs a ritual, and receives an answer without complication. The resolution relies on a "magic key" (postcard + glass) convenience rather than causal logic or ingenuity under pressure. While orientation is clear, the closure feels unearned because the protagonist sacrifices nothing to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative fails the fundamental scope requirement for short fiction, delivering a synopsis of a novel-length arc instead of a dramatized scene. The structure relies on linear "and-then" sequencing that spans vast time and space without anchoring the reader in a specific moment or setting. Closure is a symmetric satisfaction where all problems are solved without visible cost or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where intent translates immediately into successful action without significant obstacles. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—the goal is achieved exactly as planned—lacking the resonant reconfiguration or reconfiguration of stakes required for high-level closure. The "cost" of the magic is purely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear sequence, but the pivot relies on weak causality; the "memory" acts as a magical key that instantly reframes the threat without resistance. Closure is achieved, but the reinterpretation of "toppling the tower" into "future archivist" feels like an evasion of the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is a linear ritual sequence with inevitable success and no dramatized cost; the "surrender" of the present is theoretical rather than felt. Causality is driven by dream logic, and the ending ("explain-everything" symmetry) resolves without testing the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear plan-execution-success structure without significant complication or cost, failing the rubric's requirement for a closure with felt price. The ending explains the success ("purpose confirmed," "quiet rebellion") rather than letting a resonant image carry the weight. It reads as a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a static vignette lacking a clear inciting incident, rising action, or causal chain. The "closure" is a symmetrical confirmation of the status quo (morning arrives, understanding blossoms) without any visible or felt cost. The validation from the station (the tremor) resolves the scene via external affirmation rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on unearned epiphanies ("realizing it matched") rather than a causal chain of investigation or pressure. The climax resolves via magical convenience (the box shedding a tear) rather than protagonist agency, resulting in a soft reset without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no obstacles or causal turns; the "explain-everything" ending resolves the mystery through summary without a Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative structure is a repetitive loop (disturbance, verse, resolution) that fails to escalate or deepen. The causality is purely magical and convenient, and the closure relies on a thematic assertion rather than a consequence derived from a decisive narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on broad summary spanning six months rather than a grounded scene, violating the scope defaults and distancing the reader. The resolution is a "magic fix" where the council simply rescinds the decree because the protagonist glows, lacking any causal trade-off or visible cost. The causality is dream-logic (wires on trees cure death) rather than earned narrative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes trajectory where the protagonist's plan works instantly without complication or adaptation. Closure is achieved through validation rather than a decisive change with visible cost; the ending explains the success rather than dramatizing a price paid. The lack of causal struggle flattens the arc into a procedural enactment rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions ("and then") without causal friction or cost; the seed sprouts immediately, removing the tension of the process. Closure relies on a thematic summary of stasis rather than a decisive change or earned realization, and the "orientation" of the garden's rapid growth strains the established realism.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest lacking causal pressure or reversals; Rook finds the map, follows the map, and retrieves the object without obstacle. The resolution relies on "magic solving" where the leaf functions automatically, removing agency from the climax. There is no felt cost or distinct turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.0)
    The plot relies on low-stakes convenience where the environment yields a vision immediately upon the protagonist's first attempt. The time skip to "the next anniversary" dissipates immediate tension and shifts the mode from scene to summary, weakening the closure's impact. Causality is soft; events happen because the atmosphere demands them, not because of character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression ("and then he swapped the next piece") without causal pressure or reversal. The resolution is an unearned magical outcome of completing a task, lacking a Decisive Change where the protagonist pays a visible price. The ending dissolves into a "happy return" that resets the status quo without a felt cost or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.1)
    The opening "I arrived" creates an immediate POV breach (ghost narrator) as the story shifts to Mira's deep interiority without the narrator's presence. The plot relies on "video game logic" where walking a pattern magically unlocks a compartment, lacking causal friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where obstacles dissolve upon contact. The closure relies on an unearned epiphany ("home was not a fixed point") with no visible emotional or tactical cost paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear checklist of events without genuine causality or setbacks. The closure ("finally forgave himself") is a "soft reset" where the character simply decides to be healed, bypassing the necessary cost or struggle. The "time-frozen" nature of the village removes urgency, flattening the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear path of immediate success with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The "price" of forgiveness is discussed abstractly but never felt as a concrete cost or loss on the page. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—art magically solves the problem—without the requisite structural tension or earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the threat (acid sea) yields immediately to the protagonist's action without complication, resulting in a "soft reset" ending. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction"—the problem simply vanishes—lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to give the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=2.9)
    Causality relies entirely on a massive coincidence: a "wrong turn" leads immediately to the magical solution for a personal secret. The logic loop (finding a key to his own hidden chest in a stranger's cave) breaks suspension of disbelief. Closure is symmetric satisfaction without any visible or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without complication, resistance, or reversal; Mara intends, acts, and succeeds immediately. While the closure (the fisherman's arrival) is distinct, it lacks causal tension because no obstacle prevents it. The drive lens is nominally causal/magical, but it functions on dream logic where success is guaranteed, stripping the ending of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Night after night") rather than scenic action, reducing the plot to a linear ritual without obstacles. While closure is achieved (ships return), the lack of a "before/after" state change for the character makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.2)
    Causality dissolves at the climax; the antagonists' defeat is unearned, triggered by a thematic speech and a hidden object rather than logical pressure. The resolution relies on magical thinking (the eye reflecting secrets) that breaks the established ground rules.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative logic relies on an unearned magical coincidence—tides mimicking the spacing of pressed flower petals—without establishing a magical realist frame. The resolution (feeling "truly seen") feels disconnected from the passive action of observation. The "invisible ink" metaphor blurs the line between event and imagery, confusing the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, dream-logic progression where obstacles are resolved immediately by magic rather than causal effort. The ending offers a "gift" resolution—wisdom and magical success—without a visible cost or logical setup, creating a lack of earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative relies on a "magic button" resolution: the queen touches an orb, and all internal and external problems instantly dissolve ("dreams... dissolved like frost"). This symmetric satisfaction lacks causality or cost; the obstacles are merely atmospheric (a steep climb) rather than active forces that test the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative reads as a summary of a ritual that succeeds on the first try, lacking causal friction or a decisive turning point. The ending is a "happy ever after" fade-out that offers no cost or foreclosure of options, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and reflection, lacking a clear causal chain or on-page cost for the realization at the end. The epiphany about the grave feels like an unearned intellectual pivot rather than a consequence of the scene's action, and the ending resolves tension without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure without causal snapping or rising tension. The "repair" proceeds without setbacks, leading to a closure that confirms the protagonist's existing worldview rather than reconfiguring it with cost. The connection between the water clock mechanics and the birthing screw is purely metaphorical, lacking mechanical logic or narrative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path where the magic works perfectly on the first try, lacking a decisive turn or complication to generate causal pressure. The ending offers a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by magic without consequence, culminating in a sentimental closure that lacks conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual logic that is coherent within its magical-realist frame, but the mechanics of the "induced currents" remain vague. Closure is soft—an "echo" sent into the wind—resolving the internal tension without confirming the external outcome or extracting a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of success without obstacle or reversal, resembling a procedural list of actions rather than a causal plot. The "spiral arbitration" resolves the conflict via asserted magic rather than earned narrative logic. Closure is a "perfect loop" that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure ("and-then" sequencing) that lacks causal friction or meaningful reversals. While the scene has a beginning and end, the closure is a "soft reset"—a successful shift change with a purely cerebral realization—rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The stakes of the "slightest misalignment" are stated but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story dissolves from a specific scene into a montage/summary ("Each night," "Soon the farm's protective net..."), destroying narrative tension. The ending is an example of Symmetric Satisfaction: the problem is solved perfectly, the storm is weathered without loss, and there is no cost to the protagonist, violating the closure requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "video game" logic where actions (inserting a coin, lifting a lantern) yield immediate, frictionless rewards without causal necessity or cost. The ending creates a "soft reset" where the character simply writes a theorem, lacking a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or any legible price paid for the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks a decisive causal turn; the resolution relies on a convenient external validation (the anonymous "Thank you") rather than an earned shift born from the protagonist's agency. The ending explains the realization ("She realized that...") rather than letting the structural change in the loop speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative lacks causal drive or tension; it follows an "and then" sequence of ritual steps without obstacle or escalation. The closure is circular (he returns to do the same thing), offering no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or felt cost. The logic of the "covenant" and "proximate causes" operates on stated magic rather than narrative causality.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path with soft obstacles that dissolve upon contact; the "puzzle" of the ivy is solved via summary rather than on-page struggle. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction"—total success with no visible price paid—failing the requirement for a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear progression (a tour) without complication or causal branching; success is inevitable due to Lira's inherent tools. The closure relies on a "Magic Feather" trope where the setting dispenses wisdom, lacking the requisite Decisive Change or felt cost for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magical fix" causality where the protagonist whispers to a pen and the universe immediately cooperates ("offering a reassuring hand"). There is no tangible cost to the resolution; the "wrong seeds" are corrected via a sudden ripple rather than a difficult trade-off or tactical sacrifice. The closure feels unearned because the mechanism of victory (unbending/whispering) is purely metaphorical and meets no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, fable-like sequence (Arlen performs ritual, Lira inherits it) devoid of causal pressure or complications. The closure—a vow to continue—lacks weight because the magic system works instantly without obstacle or price. The transition between Arlen and Lira relies on a passive time jump rather than a consequential causal link driven by the protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece reads as a synopsis covering years and multiple locations rather than a dramatized story. It lacks a specific scene anchor, violating the single-scene/mosaic scope without earning the compression.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" resolution where the antagonists (scientists) spontaneously change their entire protocol due to a shared dream, bypassing causal logic. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without an earned price, reading more like a fable than a literary narrative with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, frictionless "and then" structure where every action succeeds immediately (coin works, map glows, radio connects, key fits). The ending creates "Symmetric Satisfaction"—the character is perfectly validated with no cost or trade-off—violating the requirement for closure with a felt price. Causality relies on "dream logic" (key vibrates, map rearranges) rather than grounded mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events ("and then" structure) lacking causal tension or unexpected turns. While a change occurs (the night learns), it feels inevitable rather than earned, as the "darkness" yields immediately to the guardian's actions without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on a "magic art" causality where synchronized lights instantly resolve complex social inertia without logical steps or backlash. The ending is an "explain-everything" resolution where the town, children, and mayor transform completely, lacking any visible sacrifice or consequence. It reads more as a summary of a fable than a dramatized causal sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" structure where obstacles vanish instantly via magic (e.g., the island appears simply because she sings). Causality is weak; the "test" mentioned in the text is resolved without struggle or failure. The ending provides a symmetric, cost-free resolution that lacks the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, outline-like sequence of execution (whittling) without causal turns, obstacles, or meaningful pressure. The closure relies on an asserted "transformation" and "redemption" that feels like a soft reset, as no visible cost or risk is paid on the page to earn the change.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks causality and resistance; the protagonist succeeds instantly because the plot requires it, with "old prohibitions folding like paper" rather than offering opposition. The premise is self-contradictory: the story begins "After the ban lifts," yet frames the action as breaking a prohibition, dissolving stakes before they manifest.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure where success is immediate and lacks obstacles; Selene arranges plants, the reed works, and she paints without failure or adaptation. The closure relies on magical realism (glass flowers sprouting) that feels like an unearned "symmetric satisfaction" rather than a consequence of a difficult choice or paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear procedural description of a successful experiment, lacking a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration of stakes. The closure is merely the cessation of the ritual; because everything functions perfectly from the start, the ending brings no reweighted meaning or felt cost. The drive lens is flat, resembling a vignette rather than a story with causal or accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality relies on dream logic and convenient magic (a thread appearing from a paper crane) rather than motivated action. The structural shift from scene to broad summary ("In the days that followed") dissipates tension, and the closure offers a generalized "happy ending" status quo rather than a decisive, costly change within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative traces a flat line where the protagonist begins with a belief and ends with the same belief reinforced, lacking a decisive change or paid cost. The ending relies on summary assertion ("found her purpose") and a "fairy tale" wrap-up ("And so...") rather than a dramatized closure event.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path: arrival, immediate success via remembered training, and departure. The closure feels unearned because the protagonist faces no genuine complication or failure state; the "cost" is stated abstractly ("sacrifice and sorrow") rather than dramatized through loss or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot follows a linear, low-stakes progression where a magical object resolves the central tension without obstacle, error, or cost. The causality is purely symbolic ("stone warmed... footage brightened"), creating a "soft reset" ending that lacks mechanical logic or earned consequence. The timeline and world rules are vague ("after dreams become shareable") and do not constrain the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual without causal pressure; the protagonist performs a symbolic action that works instantly, lacking obstacles or the risk of failure. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction" (the animal is healed, the book is signed) rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The "con" backstory provides context but does not generate active causal force in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality follows a dream-logic fetch quest (down to tunnel, up to coffee, down to tunnel) without logical grounding for why these elements connect. The closure relies on a "magic fix" ritual rather than a consequence of the protagonist's agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear dream logic where obstacles dissolve immediately upon contact (e.g., the "impossible" task is solved by humming). Closure is symmetrical and unearned, with no visible cost or causal friction to give the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a predictable ritual structure where the outcome is never in doubt, lacking causal friction or a Decisive Change with visible cost. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction" by resolving the abstract problem of "trapped creativity" through a magical event, devoid of the necessary narrative pressure or earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a ritual success without obstruction or reversal. The closure (forest regrowth) is achieved through a "soft reset" where magic solves the problem without cost or consequence. The cause-and-effect chain is smooth but lacks narrative tension or a decisive turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance where obstacles are nonexistent and solutions (the gear, the engine) appear exactly when needed. The closure is a "soft reset" that grants enlightenment without cost or sacrifice, lacking a Causal or Accumulative drive that builds tension. The "translocation" mechanic functions as a convenient plot device to bypass travel rather than a source of narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure is a linear fetch quest lacking a decisive turning point or meaningful obstacle. The closure—finding a "map of the inner self"—feels unearned because the protagonist faces no resistance; the "indirect routes" are summarized rather than experienced as causal complications. Orientation is stable, but the drive lens is weak due to the absence of stakes-altering pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on symbolic logic—a bolt changing color to convey a philosophical message—rather than causal progression, leaving the "realization" unearned. The closure is a summary of a lesson learned ("new understanding") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration born from pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no meaningful obstacles; the protagonist finds the item, uses the item, and wins immediately. The closure relies on a magic system acting on the character's behalf (the rune strips the pretender) rather than a decisive choice made under pressure. The ending is a "symmetric satisfaction" resolution that ties up threads without dramatic tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on weak causality where a physical action (tapping a table) magically triggers a digital discovery (console flashing coordinates) without logical bridging. The resolution hinges on a convenient "watermark" appearing at the right moment, which reads as unearned coincidence rather than a result of agency. The "delayed revelation" mechanism is asserted rather than structurally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=2.8)
    Causality relies on "dream logic" where the environment obeys the protagonist instantly without struggle; the stone hums and engines start simply because she asks. The sudden emergence of workers who had "abandoned their posts" contradicts the established isolation of the setting, creating a jarring logic break.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or fable rather than a dramatized scene, relying heavily on exposition ("Legends spoke of...") to move the plot. The shift to broad summary at the climax ("News of the unsealed embryo spread") shatters the scene window and dissipates tension exactly when it should peak. Causality is linear but convenient; obstacles are overcome immediately upon presentation without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative acts as a static vignette rather than a story with causal progression; the protagonist moves from panic to calm via a summarized mental exercise without obstacle or cost. The closure is vague—the intent to "plant her own beacon" blurs the line between literal gardening and metaphor, resulting in a resolution that feels unearned and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where external objects (tarot cards) magically resolve the protagonist's internal conflict without causal grounding. The resolution—a finished portrait achieved after a "descent"—feels unearned because the mechanism of change is metaphorical rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual without causal resistance or a moment where failure is a genuine risk. The climax unspools a significant logic contradiction: the ink is defined as vanishing instantly upon touching air, yet later forms a "colossal spiral" that remains "etched in the sand."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.1)
    The plot relies on a "magic bullet" resolution where the letter instantly transforms society, skipping over necessary causal steps and resistance. The ending dissolves into a summary-heavy "explain-everything" conclusion ("Thus, the echoing library...") that lacks a felt cost or earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of symbolic gestures without causal complication or obstacles; success is immediate at every beat. The closure—a communal sunrise—is a symmetric "happy path" resolution that lacks the necessary felt cost to earn its optimism.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a linear, conflict-free sequence where arbitrary magic solves abstract problems without cost. The "sound wave garden" operates on convenient logic that offers no resistance to the protagonist's goals. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—a tidy, cost-free success—rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on "magic button" causality; Mira types a hypothesis into a console which immediately solves the mystery without logical steps or investigation. The "proof by contradiction" mechanism functions as a deus ex machina rather than a reasoned process. The journalist’s arrival at the exact moment of resolution is convenient timing that lacks prior setup or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where "stitching" amber fixes "firmware" without mechanical plausibility, escalating pressure, or trade-offs. The resolution is a convenient "miracle" montage triggered by instructions found too easily in a desk, lacking a distinct closure event with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes sequence with no causal pressure or turning point; the resolution is a "soft reset" where a magical object solves the abstract problem instantly. The epilogue introduces a new character and timeline without earning the extension, diffusing the ending's impact. Closure is achieved through magical convenience rather than a decisive change with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path with zero friction or causality; the protagonist arrives, receives a magic word, and instantly fixes the world. The closure is unearned, relying on a magical resolution that stitches the sky and heals grief without demanding any sacrifice, tactical choice, or visible cost from the character.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where obstacles are resolved instantly by magic (the coin, the song) without setbacks or cost. The "fractured timeline" is an abstract problem fixed by a convenient ritual, resulting in a soft reset ending that lacks causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on "technobabble" causality where a geode and LEDs magically replicate complex neuroscience without logical bridging or setbacks. The closure—sending a file—lacks a visible or felt cost; success is absolute and immediate, failing the cost proof test required for meaningful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with no gap between expectation and result; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned without complication. Closure is unearned because there is no decisive change or felt cost—only a seamless progression to a guaranteed positive outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot is linear and coherent but lacks causal tension; the resolution is handed to the protagonist via explicit instructions from the magic object ("The instruction demanded..."). The closure—a world rewriting its story—remains abstract and unearned, as the "unscrambling" requires no sacrifice or ingenuity, only compliance. The tense shift to present at the end disrupts the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.0)
    The plot relies on convenience; the mechanism of snow codes unlocking a pillbox is purely magical and unearned. The ending is a "magic fix" where liquid and light resolve deep psychological trauma, bypassing the need for genuine causal progression or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks causality; the inciting incident is waiting, and the resolution is an external weather event (rain stopping) rather than a protagonist-driven change. The "promise" is resolved passively without obstacle or sacrifice, resulting in a low-impact vignette rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-tension path where obstacles melt immediately upon the application of the protagonist's specific virtue, lacking genuine causal friction. The closure is a "soft reset" where the world is healed without sacrifice; the "fractured timeline" logic serves as magical enablement rather than a structural constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "task-completion" structure where the protagonist plans a good deed and executes it without complication. The closure is a "mission accomplished" moment that lacks a Decisive Change, risk, or felt cost, resulting in low narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unhindered success; the protagonist faces no obstacles, and the "simple" method removes necessary tension. Closure provides symmetric satisfaction without the requisite cost or reordering of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic sequence ("and then") where magical elements resolve obstacles before they can create pressure. The closure lacks cost or reconfiguration; Mira achieves her goal instantly through a series of automated magical acceptances (the twigs open, the petal falls, the temple accepts). The causality is purely atmospheric, lacking the friction required for a satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story dissolves into a summary montage ("She taught," "Word spread") that trivializes the resolution, violating the single-scene scope. The causality is weak, relying on a "magic bullet" technology (subsonic hum) to instantly resolve complex social and political conflicts without earned effort.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where a magical tool immediately solves the central problem without complication or cost. The inciting incident and resolution are connected by convenience rather than earned causality. The ending—a painless success revealing a garden—lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" for closure, resulting in a "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on a weak magical-realism logic where painting a board causes a stone to crack and reveal a name, functioning as a *deus ex machina* rather than a causal resolution. The inciting incident ("after the evidence disappears") is pasted in with a tense error, and the resolution lacks a logical setup or genuine cost, dissolving the mystery through convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a clear inciting incident and resolution. Closure is achieved through the decisive action of sealing the nail, though the causal link between this ritual and the storm abating leans on magical correlation rather than strict logic.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative suffers from timeline confusion; the protagonist recounts a legend about a vanished hitchhiker before the event seems to resolve, blurring the inciting incident's reality. The resolution relies on "dream logic" where performing a song automatically fixes the problem without causal friction or obstacle. The ending is a costless restoration that feels like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis rather than a dramatized story, spanning years with summary bridges ("Months later," "When the inevitable crash arrived") that erode tension. While the physical closure (leaving the train) is clear, the causal chain is abstract, and the climax is narrated rather than experienced in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative proceeds through "and then" sequencing where obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (the stars form arrows; the door opens; the crystal sings). The resolution relies on a magic-key logic—the telegram simply solves the ancient mystery because the plot demands it—stripping the climax of earned causality. There is no on-page cost; the protagonist succeeds perfectly on the first attempt, rendering the "burden" invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    Orientation is disjointed; the transition from a "failed magic trick" with onlookers to a solitary druidic ritual is jarring and unexplained. The narrative arc is a linear procedure (chant, melt, retrieve) without complications, reversals, or a felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative lacks causality and resistance; obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (e.g., the maze parts simply because she "understood"). The resolution is unearned, relying on dream-logic where environment and magic solve problems for the protagonist without cost or struggle. The "Orientation Test" is strained by the contradictory mobility of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual sequence without a decisive turning point or obstacle; the protagonist attempts a fix and succeeds immediately. The "cost" of the pact is relegated to backstory or abstract future consequence ("every future she touched"), lacking immediate on-page weight to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulative path but lacks causal propulsion; the "action" consists primarily of static examination and thought. Closure is achieved through a diary entry that summarizes the lesson learned, resulting in a low-cost, told-not-earned resolution that feels disconnected from the preceding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of intent followed by immediate success, lacking an inciting incident to disrupt the status quo. The closure—a decision to move to a new location—feels low-stakes and inevitable, missing a legible cost or sacrifice. Causality is soft; the seed grows simply because she performs the ritual correctly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative is linear and structurally complete, but operates on dream logic where the central problem ("tomorrow disappeared") is solved by a symbolic ritual without tactical difficulty. The closure lands a conceptual shift, but the cost (gears turning slower) feels abstract and lacks on-page weight.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative is purely linear with no causal friction or reversal; Mara arrives, succeeds immediately, and leaves. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem dissolves instantly via magic, lacking any earned causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression of events without causal tension or meaningful obstacles; the protagonist arrives, follows directions, and finds peace too easily. The closure feels unearned, relying on a stated realization ("forgiveness is not a destination") rather than a consequence of a difficult choice. There is no tangible cost paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, resistance-free path of "arrive, solve, succeed" with no causal friction or cost. The resolution is a "mission accomplished" moment that lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.9)
    Causality breaks at the climax; the Envoy's reversal is a "magic feather" resolution where music dissolves deep-seated geopolitical ambition without cost. The ticking clock ("promise loses its glow") is vague and lacks mechanical pressure on the scene's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative functions as a linear procedural where the protagonist moves from intent to success without causal setbacks or complications. While closure is achieved via the completed task, the absence of obstacles or tactical pivots prevents the plot from generating narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies entirely on summary and montage ("returned to the vines each morning," "soon the next harvest") rather than a dramatized scene. There is no specific closure unit in time; the story drifts into a generalized state of success without a distinct turning point or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedure: the client requests a service, and Mara performs it without obstacle or reversal. The unhooking of the knot is a mechanical resolution to an internal problem that lacks on-page resistance. Causality is soft; the "magic" of the chimes and shard works automatically rather than through earned insight or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path without meaningful obstacles; the protagonist succeeds simply by waiting as the plot demands. Closure relies on an explained epiphany ("The delayed revelation struck her") rather than a dramatized realization earned through visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The structure is linear and lacks a distinct turning point or moment of pressure; the protagonist desires a skill and acquires it without complication or setback. While the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (navigating the mind instead of the canyon), it arrives without a felt cost or a prior foreclosure of options, reading more like a completed tutorial than a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear and low-stakes, relying on a magical object to resolve the central conflict without requiring a difficult trade-off from the protagonist. The "mist walking" ability appears conveniently to solve the physical obstacle, removing tension from the climb. Causality is soft, driven by symbolic assertions ("The act... was symbolic") rather than organic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative is a frictionless linear sequence where the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's desires, lacking causality, obstacles, or cost. A severe logical fracture exists: the ship is described as resting in the "deepest trench" yet simultaneously breaking the surface, breaking spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: the protagonist wants to decode a message, performs the steps, and succeeds without complication or meaningful reversal. The closure lands as a "soft" realization, but because there was no resistance or possibility of failure, the ending feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure (summon, name, release) without significant causal complications or reversals. The closure (ascension) feels like a "soft reset" where the problem dissolves magically, lacking a "decisive change" with visible, felt cost on the page. The "finding old recordings" backstory is mentioned but does not actively pressure the scene's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution arc ("symmetric satisfaction") without the required felt cost or sacrifice to earn the resolution. While the closure is complete, the lack of orientation obstacles or causal setbacks makes the outcome feel mechanical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.4)
    The opening sentence introduces a fatal orientation error: a setting cannot be both "midnight" and "twilight" simultaneously. Causality is broken by the central device: a "vigilant" warden follows a trail of sun-faded photographs on a levee she presumably patrols daily—why are they seen only now? The ending is an unearned magic-wand resolution where the town instantly accepts a rewritten history without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "recipe" structure where step A leads predictably to step B without causal complication. Closure arrives as "symmetric satisfaction"—she seeks the bridge and gets it perfectly—lacking the required felt or conceptual cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with a soft closure that restores the status quo ("renewed trust") without a decisive turn or cost. The causality is functional but low-stakes; the climb and repair happen because the plot requires them, not because of a desperate, narrowing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative operates as a synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, lacking causal friction; the protagonist acts without meaningful obstruction. The resolution creates a massive causality break where "history rewrote itself" acts as a deus ex machina to instantly resolve the factional conflict without earned negotiation or cost. Closure is forced and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure (receive seed, build room, success) devoid of complications or failure states. The closure offers a moment of triumph but lacks the required cost or repricing; Mara risks nothing and loses nothing, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned. The middle section compresses the critical design phase into summary, bypassing potential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance, where the "catalyst" (pulling a cord) yields immediate, magical success. Causality is assertive rather than earned; the house heals because the text declares it so, lacking a decisive change born of struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative relies on a "soft reset" ending where the arrival of dawn arbitrarily resolves the threat of the cultist pendant. The causal link between the passive act of waiting and the pendant transforming into a safe key is missing, leaving the closure unearned and devoid of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural path ("try, adjust, succeed") without meaningful obstacles or reversals. The "penny dropping" serves as an arbitrary timer rather than a causal driver. Closure is achieved through symmetric satisfaction—the problem is fixed without cost or sacrifice—lacking the required Decisive Change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative follows a linear wish-fulfillment path with no meaningful obstacles; the problem is solved by the correct thought ("discarding assumptions") and a magic item. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where villagers immediately thank her, lacking any Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of wish-fulfillment with no obstacles or complications. The closure—the ferry's return—is achieved without any visible or felt cost, failing the rubric's requirement for a decisive change involving sacrifice or price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (enter, weave, succeed, leave) lacking causal turns or obstacles. The environment yields instantly to the protagonist’s desires, resulting in a "success-only" sequence devoid of tension. Closure is achieved through a "realization" stated by the narrator without a legible felt or conceptual cost paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative operates as a summary or montage ("Each night," "When the first test vessel...") rather than a dramatized scene with a specific "now." There is no inciting incident that disrupts the status quo on the page, and the resolution is a foregone conclusion without causal friction. The lack of a singular, anchored scene prevents genuine narrative drive or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a linear fetch quest lacking causal tension; the protagonist follows a signal to a resolution without encountering resistance. While the closure (restored photo) is legible, it arrives via a "magic fix" that requires no sacrifice or ingenuity from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure (arrive, activate, succeed, leave) with no significant complication or reversal. The closure—burying the codex to ensure things are "never forgotten"—presents a logical contradiction (hiding the monitoring tool usually prevents monitoring) that weakens the causal chain. The ending feels like a generic resolution rather than a consequence of the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on arbitrary "dream logic" (ink and porcelain repairing server code) that solves the problem without causal friction or setback. Closure lands on a Decisive Change, but the lack of a visible or felt cost makes the victory feel unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (observe birds -> perform magic -> succeed) with no meaningful reversals or "Decisive Change" involving trade-offs. The closure feels like a completed checklist item ("Mission Accomplished") rather than a reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "arrive, fix, leave" structure lacking meaningful complications or causal density. The resolution relies on the unexplained magical properties of the arrowhead—an immediate fix—rather than a character-driven causal chain, tactical adjustment, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative lacks genuine causality or cost; the conflict is resolved via "magic feather" logic where obstacles dissolve instantly upon the first attempt (the statue steps aside immediately). There is no closure cost—the regime falls and the orchard blooms without sacrifice, trade-off, or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative relies on dream logic and convenience rather than causality; the drone retreats from a flash yet inexplicably leaves its hatch open for the delivery. The resolution is too tidy—the rival pilot’s immediate nod of recognition dissolves the tension without earning the truce. The orientation is shaky; the "smuggling drone border" concept is asserted but not mechanically integrated into the arcade setting.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where actions yield immediate magical rewards, bypassing causality and cost (e.g., the map appears conveniently; the door opens without effort). Spatially, the train is contradictory—simultaneously "hissing along rails" (moving) and having "long unmoved" gears (abandoned/static). The closure is an "explain-everything" realization unearned by the preceding lack of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" structure of a ritual performed without complication, error, or opposition. The story lacks a true climax or Decisive Change; the ritual succeeds perfectly on the first try with no causal friction or unforeseen consequences. Closure is a "mission accomplished" reset that logs the event rather than reconfiguring the stakes or extracting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative operates as a summary of a magical procedure rather than a causal scene, lacking a distinct inciting incident or rising action. The closure violates the cost requirement, offering a "happily ever after" summary ("From that day forward") without a decisive change or paid price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the protagonist faces no meaningful resistance; the solution (a breeze revealing the groove) is given by the environment rather than earned. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" without the required felt or conceptual cost, failing to meet the standard for a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, convenient path where obstacles dissolve via magic ritual without earned causality or setback. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction"—a total fix with no visible cost—failing the requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with a price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "treasure hunt" logic where abstract clues (tea leaf geometry) conveniently yield precise instructions without trial or error. The closure is unearned; the "darkness" reveals itself to be harmless manuscripts, removing all antagonistic force, and the resolution is a magical fix-all ("light that healed the stone walls") with zero paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes "and then" progression where magic instantly resolves every obstacle (e.g., singing to the storm) without causality or cost. The ending is a summary of success that lacks a decisive, earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is a linear progression of task completion ("Symmetric Satisfaction") lacking a decisive turn or complication. The closure is achieved through the mechanical finishing of the net and mask, with no visible or felt cost to the protagonist. The story moves smoothly from intent to execution without testing the character's resolve or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.0)
    The plot is a linear enactment of a ritual that succeeds without complication or reversal. While the sequence is coherent, the closure ("chapel opens") arrives without a paid cost or meaningful sacrifice, failing the requirement for a high-stakes change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.1)
    Causality is severely strained by the mechanics of the climax; untangling copper wires on a submerged console somehow triggering audio from a wax cylinder lacks established logic or physical credibility. The drive lens is muddled by this "magical" solution to a technical problem, making the closure feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of frictionless success: the balladeer acts, the ghost responds, and connection is achieved without setback or cost. The ending devolves into a fairytale summary ("travelers who slipped into the courtyard found...") rather than a sharp, dramatized closure unit, failing to deliver a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear fetch-quest with no causality beyond "and then"; the protagonist faces no setbacks. A jarring tense shift ("as the elevator climbs... began") breaks the timeline during the inciting climb. Closure is a return to the status quo without a paid cost (emotional or physical).

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is logically fractured; the gondola hangs from a "broken string" over a "void," yet the protagonist simply walks onto a landing platform at the end. The narrative is a linear sequence of observations with no causal tightening or decisive change in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot hinges on a spatial contradiction: the text states the "condemned building across the lot" is the one falling, yet treats the library's survival as a miraculous defiance of erasure. This confusion renders the central stake—that her art might be destroyed—logically hollow, as the library was never the target.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative relies on convenience plotting where disparate elements (hopscotch, phrasebook) lock together effortlessly without causal logic. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the protagonist succeeds completely without cost or sacrifice, failing the requirement for a decisive change with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure where the protagonist meets no resistance, rendering the climax purely procedural. The ending provides task completion but lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible, felt cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, predictable path where the plan is stated, executed, and succeeds without deviation or friction. Closure provides "symmetric satisfaction"—the ritual works exactly as intended—failing the requirement for a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression where success is immediate and unopposed (the gears "acknowledge" her, the pane materializes on cue). Closure is achieved through a "god-mode" assertion ("Time bowed before her") rather than earned causality or paid cost. The ending feels like a soft reset with no visible price extracted from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative structure is functional, but the inciting work ("assembling clues") is relegated to summary, leaving the on-page scene as a low-resistance delivery task. The logic connecting the "reed impressions" to the "blueprint" relies on soft magic that dissolves under scrutiny rather than sturdy causal links.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality breaks when Mara creates a polymer bridge at the riverbank; the text implies she has the "polymer solution" in her pocket during a nature hike, a teleporting prop that shatters credibility. The "Months later" summary dissipates all narrative tension rather than dramatizing the result.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative structure is a linear procedural of magical actions that succeed without resistance or causality; the "store opening" frame contradicts the ancient atmosphere, creating orientation debt. Closure arrives through a soft handover of the bottle, lacking the decisive change or cost required to make the ending resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual without causal friction; the connection between "analyzing tidal pools" and the magical act of healing coral is associative rather than logical. While the closure provides a clear image of "brittle resilience," the lack of obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions with no obstacles or reversals. The closure is unearned because there is no meaningful tightening of stakes; the "healing" happens by fiat rather than through causal consequence or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "try-succeed" path with negligible resistance; the "sudden tremor" is a token obstacle that resolves immediately without consequence. Closure is a summary of success rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with paid cost. The logic is dream-like, relying on asserted connections ("synaptic plasticity" in rocks) rather than grounded causality.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure with no meaningful obstacles or deviation from the plan. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved instantly by "instinct" with no visible or felt cost, failing the rubric's requirement for a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with price. The resolution is convenient and lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.6)
    Causality is undermined by erratic tense shifts (e.g., &quot;began&quot; vs. &quot;uncurls,&quot; &quot;placed&quot; vs. &quot;traces&quot;) that confuse the timeline. The narrative is a linear progression of success with no opposition; the silence yields instantly to his efforts, rendering the &quot;inciting incident&quot; and &quot;climax&quot; mechanically identical.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where imaginary actions (placing a bishop in the sky) solve complex problems without established causal rules or resistance. The resolution feels unearned because the mechanism of the "covenant" and its repair is purely asserted, not demonstrated. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction without a tangible price paid by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successful actions with no resistance, setbacks, or distinct turning points. The ending relies on a didactic summary of the theme rather than a dramatic structural shift or earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on linear summary ("Night after night," "Each dawn") rather than a dramatized scene with causal pressure. The closure is a "realization" that feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant obstacle or potential for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure with no meaningful escalation or reversal; the solution is found without struggle. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by a convenient magical object without visible cost or sacrifice, failing the requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist simply observes and then resolves the problem with a "whisper" that lacks established causal logic. This ending acts as a soft reset, dissipating the storm's energy without a dramatized cost, effectively breaking the promise of the scientific setup.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear vignette describing a ritual with no causal complication, resistance, or decisive change. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—she enters, succeeds effortlessly, and leaves—without the required reconfiguration of options or paid cost that constitutes literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure lacking resistance; the protagonist desires an insight, goes to a location, receives it immediately, and returns. The closure, while conceptually tidy, fails the rubric's cost requirement—success is total and unearned by sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative logic (print, reaction, crack) without genuine causal friction or resistance; events occur because the premise dictates them, not due to agency under pressure. While the ending provides a change in state (the cracked halo), the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on a repetitive episodic structure (encounter, use pendant, instant success) that lacks causal progression or rising tension. The ending dissolves into a summarized "happily ever after" epilogue rather than delivering a dramatized closure beat with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.6)
    The plot is a linear demonstration of a magical hypothesis with no obstacles or complications to generate tension. Causality is soft—the magic simply works because the protagonist wills it—and the closure is an intellectual assertion of success rather than a consequence of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a mechanical "insert item A to solve problem B" structure without causal deepening; the "rummage sale" element introduces a fatal logic break in the mythic fantasy setting.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative reads as a summary of events rather than a dramatized scene; obstacles dissolve immediately (the tunnel "invites" him, the silk "slipped onto his arm"). Causality is soft; the protagonist succeeds because the world accommodates him, not because he overcomes resistance. The ending is an "and then he lived happily" summary that lacks a distinct, pressure-filled closure beat on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies heavily on deus ex machina; the shard functions as an all-powerful tool that resolves the central mystery and the climax with a mere whisper. Causality is weak, as the solution (merging worlds) creates a "fix-it" ending that bypasses the logical consequences of the catastrophic engine failure mentioned in the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative arc relies on a magical "soft reset" (stones glowing) to solve the inciting incident (lamp dying), stripping the climax of causality and cost. The closure is a symmetric satisfaction that erases the stakes rather than forcing the protagonist to navigate a changed reality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.4)
    The plot is a linear ritual enactment without causal obstacles or reversals; the outcome feels predetermined. The "last print newspaper" trigger lacks causal logic within the fantasy setting, appearing as an arbitrary checklist item rather than an organic plot driver. Closure brings success ("world... reborn") without a visible cost or trade-off to balance the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.5)
    The plot is a linear sequence of convenient discoveries without obstruction or reversal; obstacles are resolved immediately by magical objects (the wing, the scroll). The "revelation" beat is unearned, as a scroll literally explains the central mystery to the protagonist. Causality is driven by dream logic rather than narrative pressure, leading to a frictionless ending.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression of success with no causal friction, setbacks, or cost. The "Orientation Test" fails due to contradictory logic: a "rattling wind" and storm coexist with a "silent corridor" where a pin is heard, creating confusion. Closure is a "mission accomplished" checklist without the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that carries a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, frictionless trajectory where the protagonist's actions immediately solve the problem without resistance or complication. The closure provides "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect, cost-free restoration of the world—which fails to register as a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic progression where obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (the market is a façade; the library just opens). The ending is a classic &quot;Soft Reset&quot; where a magical object (the mirror) resolves the internal conflict without the protagonist paying a visible or felt cost. Causality is replaced by thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, vignette-like structure with no meaningful causal turns or decisive changes. The inciting discovery (warm bread in a years-old tin) relies on unexplained dream logic that breaks the established physical reality of the ruins without setting ground rules. Closure is achieved through mood rather than a consequence of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural track (Accumulative lens) without a decisive change or reversal that alters the character's path. Closure is achieved through a "happy ending" affirmation ("silence answered") that lacks a visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is solid: the decoy allows the approach, and the destruction of the lanterns effectively thwarts the theft by removing the objective. The closure works as Earned Stasis, though the elders' immediate acceptance of the resolution feels slightly convenient given the broken truce.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (observe, taste, realize, record) with no meaningful causal turns or reversals. The closure is a low-stakes realization ("understanding the system") acquired without visible cost or trade-off, making the ending feel like a summary rather than a dramatic resolution. The orientation is stable, but the plot lacks a drive lens that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path, but the climax relies on a *deus ex machina*—a guardian appearing in the painting to provide the solution—rather than earned causality. The orientation is adequate, but the resolution lacks a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear fetch-quest of unearned successes (finds map, finds door, finds vent) leading to a "Soft Reset" ending where a whisper magically heals the biosphere. The resolution lacks narrative friction or cost; the global problem vanishes simply because the protagonist asserts the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative is a summary of a routine ("Every morning") rather than a dramatized scene with a specific inciting incident; the lack of a singular event prevents meaningful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality collapses into dream logic; the physical threat of a fire is resolved by "miniaturizing chaos" in water pipes via a wooden box, which lacks intelligible mechanism. The protagonist resolves the "impending controlled burn escape" by initiating a controlled burn, creating a confusing sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where "listening" physically unlatches a lock without establishing the causal rules, breaking the Causal/Situational lens. The resolution is unearned symmetric satisfaction where a single action magically heals the entire community, lacking the required closure cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where rituals solve physical problems without causality; the spatial orientation is contradictory (a sunken lab where tides rise and the building later rises like a phoenix). The ending dissolves into a summary of "legend" status rather than an earned narrative closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative follows a linear, lock-and-key structure where obstacles are resolved immediately by convenient magical tools. The ending provides "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect solution with no lingering tension or price paid—failing the requirement for closure with felt or conceptual cost. The causality is smooth but lacks the friction of a genuine narrative argument.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions (ritual setup, chant, success) lacking a true turning point or complication. Causality is mechanical; the spell works exactly as intended without unforeseen obstacles or consequences. The ending is an example of symmetric satisfaction, where the problem is solved neatly with no structural cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative pivots on a trivial convenience (forgotten sugar) and resolves via a summary of future weeks rather than dramatizing the breakthrough in the scene itself. This reliance on an epilogue-style summary diffuses the tension of the specific night and bypasses the necessary on-page cost of the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative is a static vignette rather than a causal plot; events proceed in a linear, friction-free sequence ("drifted," "recorded," "felt"). Closure is a "soft reset" where the protagonist achieves her goal via magical assertion without facing obstacles or paying a visible cost. The drive lens is nominally accumulative but lacks reconfiguration of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot forms a functional linear sequence (ritual -> key -> release), but causality is soft, relying on dream logic where objects interact conveniently (key melts, thorn pulses) without resistance. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the lack of prior obstacles makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned. Orientation is stable, but the narrative drive is weak, reading more like a list of performed actions than a story under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure devoid of tension, culminating in "symmetric satisfaction" where a half-shell neatly fits a whole one to solve a metaphysical problem without cost. The pacing is summary-like, gliding over the "progressive disclosure" rather than dramatizing the discovery process. Closure is purely mechanical and unearned, relying on a magical fix that instantly resolves the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative reads as a procedural summary of a magic system rather than a dramatized scene; events unfold linearly without causal resistance or necessity. The closure is a task completion ("pulsed brighter") that lacks the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; success is inevitable and unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative is a static vignette that loops back to the beginning (returning the next night) without a decisive change or paid cost. The causality is weak, relying on a series of observations rather than consequential actions. The ending is a "soft reset" that fails to deliver the required closure unit (DC, RR, or CR).

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a low-resistance linear path with a "magic button" ending where an internal realization instantly fixes external physics without cost. The resolution feels unearned, relying on a convenient "explain-everything" epiphany that dissolves all obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story functions as a synopsis or legend summary rather than a dramatized scene, spanning an indefinite period ("Night after night," "Across the rise") without specific grounding. Causality is soft, relying on "and then" sequencing where actions (arranging mirrors, rallying clans) yield immediate success without complication or cost. Closure is a generic "symmetric satisfaction" happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on dream logic with no causal friction; the magic system lacks constraints, allowing the poet to succeed instantly without cost. A critical temporal break occurs at the closure: the sun sets, yet moments later the poet walks toward the sunrise, fracturing the story’s timeline and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is a linear procedural with zero friction; the protagonist formulates a plan and executes it without error or interruption. The "storm-born seekers" are a theoretical threat that exerts no pressure on the scene. Closure is a symmetric satisfaction where the goal is achieved perfectly with no cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes progression where the environment provides the solution (the "crack" of release) without the protagonist making a difficult choice or paying a cost. The resolution is an unearned epiphany facilitated by magical atmospheric mechanics rather than character action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where turning a physical valve metaphorically "loosens" bureaucratic neglect, breaking causal plausibility. The resolution is unearned, lacking an on-page cost or obstacle; the lantern functions as a convenient magic wand that dissolves the central problem without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, resistance-free path where the central problem is solved by the protagonist's first attempt, lacking any Decisive Change with visible cost. The ending creates a "soft reset" where the conflict evaporates into total satisfaction, missing the requirement for a felt price or sacrifice to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and then" structure with no causal complications, setbacks, or meaningful obstacles to the protagonist's goal. Closure is weak, offering a "next adventure" setup rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change that alters the status quo with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies on summary and dream logic rather than grounded causality; the leap from a digital algorithm flagging a post to Lia physically navigating to a room "hidden behind a wall of obsolete emojis" is ontologically confusing. The climax is frictionless, with the vault opening immediately upon discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance with no causality or cost; the protagonist simply enacts a ritual that succeeds instantly. The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction," resolving the conflict perfectly via magic without the required Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration involving felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative lacks causal drive; it is a linear sequence of observations leading to an inevitable epiphany without obstacle or resistance. The closure is a soft reset where the character simply decides they are healed, lacking a legible cost or decisive change in tactics. The "realization" ending feels unearned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path of thematic assertions with no obstacles; the "bus" frame implies a time loop or continuity error (leaving at both start and end) that disrupts coherence. Closure is asserted via emotional labels rather than earned through action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events (arrival, ritual, teaching, departure) that lacks a disrupting incident or causal friction. The closure is an "Earned Stasis" in form only, as the Keeper’s departure feels like a scheduled exit rather than a resolution born of pressure or change.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear "and-then" structure where abstract problems are solved by magical convenience (pulsing photos, a glowing feather) rather than causal action. The closure is unearned symmetric satisfaction, resolving "collective pain" instantly without visible cost or logical progression.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events with low causal density; the climax (the crystal amplifying) happens *to* the protagonist because of the time of day, not because of her actions. The ending loop—leaving and immediately returning—confuses the timeline and blunts the sense of closure, lacking a decisive change in the protagonist's status or world.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative suffers from a causality gap where the quest object (chalk) transitions from "misplaced" to "in hand" without a dramatized discovery; the ending offers symmetric satisfaction without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "fix-it" path with low causality; the solution relies on dream logic (sound carrying from a distant forest to a lunar rim) that feels unearned. Closure is achieved through a technical adjustment rather than a resonant reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative is a linear procedural of a "flawless" death with no obstacles, reversals, or meaningful tightening. The closure offers symmetric satisfaction—everything goes exactly to plan—lacking the required felt cost or resonant reconfiguration of a true literary ending.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path: desire, action, success, resolution. There is no meaningful tightening of options or "Decisive Change" involving a felt cost; the protagonist simply performs a task and succeeds without sacrifice. The mention of "spoons bent reality" feels like an arbitrary backstory patch that fails to integrate causally with the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic path with no complications or deviations; the "fix" (placing the tooth) works instantly, lacking causal struggle. While a change occurs, it feels inevitable rather than earned, as the solution encounters no resistance and extracts no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative is a linear progression of successful actions without causal complication or distinct orientation; the "orientation" is vague ("grotto," "mist") and the sequence lacks a turning point. Closure is achieved through a summary of success ("All who entered thereafter would feel...") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.6)
    The plot is a frictionless linear progression where the protagonist faces no resistance; the environment and technology yield instantly to her desires. The resolution relies on unexplained "magic" (using a pendant to rewrite server code) and offers unearned "symmetric satisfaction" where the entire ecosystem is healed without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, "and-then" structure of abstract actions without causal necessity or a grounded inciting incident. The "Orientation Test" fails completely; the setting is a metaphorical void ("mist," "nexus") with no concrete spatial or temporal anchors. Closure is a soft reset—she leaves to return—lacking a Decisive Change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear progression of unqualified success without obstacles, causal pressure, or reversal. Closure is achieved through a "symmetric satisfaction" summary that explains the resolution ("From that day forward") rather than a dramatized ending with visible cost or conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a procedural loop (a ritual described) rather than a story with a decisive turn. While the sequence is clear, there is no causality driven by pressure; the "inciting incident" is merely the arrival of night, and the "climax" is the successful functioning of a spell with no risk of failure. Closure is a restatement of the premise (a covenant to continue) without a visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story operates as a procedural summary rather than a dramatized scene, relying on "and then" sequencing ("He then spent hours," "He fashioned...") to bypass the actual struggle of the process. Closure is achieved through a drift into future-tense summary rather than a decisive moment of change or cost in the present. The lack of a specific, high-pressure incident leaves the plot feeling flat and anecdotal.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural log of a successful ritual (enter, orient, transmute, exit) with no obstruction or deviation. Closure is merely the cessation of the task, lacking a decisive change or felt cost; the drive lens is static.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path with no causal friction; the wood "surrenders" and the sap traps itself without difficulty. The climax relies on unearned magical realism (steam and glass turning wood into a glowing lantern) that lacks established ground rules or cost. The tense shift caused by the prompt insertion ("while the kettle boils") briefly disrupts the timeline's stability.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic: collect fragments, arrange them, trade for closure. The orientation is established early, and the surreal causality of the "trade" holds within the established dream-logic frame. However, the resolution feels somewhat convenient—the ghost cooperates immediately upon the offer—lacking a sense of risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of unobstructed success with no causal friction; the protagonist intends to fix the terminal and simply does so without setback. The mechanism of resolution (using a sextant to route voltage) relies on dream logic rather than established story rules, and the ending lacks a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative logic collapses when the "soundless sanctuary" and "utterly mute" walls explicitly produce a "chime" and "hum" without explanation. Furthermore, a severe editing error leaves a substantial paragraph duplicated verbatim in the middle of the text, completely arresting narrative momentum. The plot lacks causal friction, proceeding linearly from desire to success without a testing obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    Causality operates on dream-logic where aligning a sundial arbitrarily resolves physical barriers without established rules or costs. The narrative provides a sequence of events but lacks a grounded mechanism, resulting in unearned progression.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative forms a static vignette rather than a story; the protagonist succeeds at his goal in the first half with no obstacles, then enters a montage of waiting that resolves via external signal rather than agency. Causality is absent—events drift on atmospheric associations rather than because/therefore logic. The closure ("ready to be shared") is a convenient arrival that requires no sacrifice or reconfiguration of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without causality or cost; the protagonist arrives, succeeds at his task without obstacle, and leaves. Orientation is atmospheric but lacks the concrete grounding required to establish stakes or meaningful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)
    Closure relies on a "magic fix" where the hatching instantly harmonizes the world, resolving the conflict without the required visible or felt cost. The sequence is linear and predictable, lacking a decisive turning point where the protagonist must sacrifice something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative is a linear ritual sequence lacking causal turns or meaningful obstacles. The ending ("villagers... gathered," "clouds... pause") is a "Symmetric Satisfaction" resolution that validates the protagonist without cost or risk. The drive lens is purely atmospheric; events happen because the author wills a happy ending, not because of character agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path where the central obstacle (the box sticking) is resolved immediately by "recalling patience," a soft-magic solution with no cost. The closure is tidy and atmospheric but lacks a decisive change or earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a linear ritual rather than a causal plot; the protagonist intends to place the gear, places it, and succeeds without deviation. The Inciting Incident is backstory (a vow), and the "troubling" shadows of war offer no resistance to the protagonist's progress, resulting in a low-stakes progression.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative violates short-story scope by summarizing months of activity rather than dramatizing a specific scene or turning point. Consequently, there is no distinct closure unit on the page, only a generalized state of success without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural without a decisive turn, complication, or felt cost; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned, leading to a predictable resolution. The story lacks a moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist must pay a price for success. Closure is achieved through assertion ("balance is a song sung together") rather than a dramatic reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of events without causal friction or legitimate closure cost; the realization is a platitude. Basic physical credibility fails as a tapestry and map are placed inside a sovereign case (a small coin holder), breaking the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear path of least resistance, relying on "symmetric satisfaction" where the solution works perfectly on the first attempt. The plot lacks a "try-fail" cycle; the "crystal contraption" functions as a deus ex machina that resolves the central problem instantly. The skeptical scholars—the only potential obstacle—capitulate in the same sentence they are introduced, removing any narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative relies on magical convenience rather than causality; "dust particles" carry the news to the audience, removing the protagonist's burden of solving the distribution problem. The climax involves merely pressing play with no risk of failure or price paid. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where everyone wins without sacrifice, lacking the required felt or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure lacking causal friction or distinct obstacles. The critical mechanic ("incomplete information") is solved by immediate assertion ("patterns only she could decipher") rather than dramatized effort. While a change occurs (the crystallization), it feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a flat trajectory with a "symmetric satisfaction" ending; the choice to preserve both narratives removes the necessity of a hard decision. The single-paragraph structure prevents the formation of distinct dramatic beats, resulting in a summary rather than a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure without causal friction; the central problem (hatred) dissolves instantly upon the application of the solution (music), lacking the resistance required for a narrative arc. The ending is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" in form but feels unearned because the obstacle provided no genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression where intended actions succeed immediately without complication or reversal. The closure creates a positive change but lacks a legible cost or "Decisive Change," reading instead as a predetermined outcome of the magic system. The sequence relies on "and then" progression rather than causal pressure or obstacle negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, convenient chain: the riddle solves itself upon reading, the key fits immediately, and the drone resolves the central conflict by magic. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction," fixing the city's malaise without the protagonist paying any visible or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" structure driven by magical convenience rather than causality; the shard works instantly and perfectly. The lack of a decisive turn or felt cost reduces the ending to a soft, unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative follows a linear "and then" progression without causal tension or earned resolution. Closure is achieved through magical fiat rather than protagonist agency or cost; the ending is a declared victory that lacks the requisite conceptual or emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative creates a linear sequence, but the central causal link—how dice rolls physically alter stone steps via "living algorithms"—is abstract and magical, lacking mechanical grounding. The climax ("quiet rupture") and resolution are purely internal and philosophical, resolving the tension without a visible material cost or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.0)
    The structure resembles a summary vignette rather than a dramatized scene, spanning a loose timeline (moonrise to sunrise to moonrise) that dilutes tension. The resolution relies on a coincidental arrival that validates the protagonist without forcing a decisive, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative operates as a summary of a fable rather than a causal scene, relying on magical convenience (the lens thawing ice) to resolve the plot. Closure is a "soft reset" where the central problem vanishes instantly without a visible or felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.9)
    The plot relies on a convenient coincidence (finding the yoyo in the sand) and "magic wand" causality where abstract concepts (yoyo spin = gear ratios) instantly solve complex mechanical problems. The narrative follows a linear checklist of events with no meaningful obstacles or setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies on arbitrary magical causality, where "paradoxical notes" and a spoken word ("vanish") resolve the conflict without established mechanics or earned cost. The closure—a final bargain—feels disconnected from the "vanish" resolution, functioning as a "soft reset" rather than a consequence of the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions without causal friction, reversals, or meaningful resistance. Closure is a return to stasis ("mission unchanged") with no visible or felt cost, failing the requirement for a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on convenience and dream-logic (a map pulses to reveal a tunnel, the tunnel opens on cue) rather than causal friction. The resolution is a thematic pivot ("it was never lost") that feels like a soft reset rather than a consequence of prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on weak causality where intellectual realizations trigger magical environmental changes (ivy retreating) without established ground rules. The resolution is unearned, solving the central conflict through a symbolic gesture (placing the letter) rather than a causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and lacks a strong causal chain; events happen sequentially without necessary linkage. The mechanics of the "repairs"—placing paper notes into wet stone foundations using water-soluble ink—strain credibility and confuse the physical action. Closure is an earned stasis, but the cost is purely atmospheric, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis rather than a dramatized story, spanning a blackout, a council meeting, and a return to the library in a rush of summary. This violates the single-scene scope appropriate for the length, resolving complex societal issues off-page and lacking a cohesive closure unit with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear, linear Accumulative structure, moving from the trigger (noon shadow) through the ritual process to a resonant closure. The pacing is steady, though the transition from sunrise to noon in the opening feels slightly summary-heavy. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis, effectively resolving the immediate cycle, though the lack of unexpected obstacles makes the progression feel somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a frictionless linear path where the protagonist succeeds immediately without setbacks or adaptation. Closure relies on an abstract "state of being" realization (Conceptual Repricing) that lacks a visible on-page cost; the breaking of the crystal reads as a special effect rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    The plot is a linear execution of instructions (fly drone, pull lever) without obstacles, reversals, or meaningful choices. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction," resolving the goal instantly and perfectly without the required visible or felt cost, resulting in a lack of narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure ("summoned," went, found, fixed) that lacks causal friction or genuine obstacles. The ending relies on a "magic fix" where an external object (the singing wood) instantly resolves the protagonist's lifelong internal struggle, resulting in a soft reset without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative is linear but lacks causal tension; the "untethering" beat confuses physical action with metaphor (a rope binding "fears" physically falls into the mist). The synchronization via moon phases for a face-to-face meeting strains logic. Closure is achieved through simple agreement without testing the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on a summary bridge ("As the day unfolded") that elides the central journey, dissipating tension and breaking the scene-time constraint essential for short fiction. The ending creates a soft return to the status quo without a decisive change, felt cost, or clear causality on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" logic where clues appear conveniently without causal necessity (newspapers lead to crate, crate to mirror). The closure relies on a magical object (the mirror) explaining the character's growth rather than an earned internal shift. The orientation is functional, but the progression lacks resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path (gather, mix, transform) without a meaningful turn, complication, or deepening of the dilemma. The inciting incident ("fortune from cookie") is relegated to backstory, and the climax resolves smoothly without demanding a new tactic or paying a visible price beyond the planned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual sequence ("and then") lacking causal friction, unexpected obstacles, or the risk of failure. Closure relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" ending ("the world would mend") where the stated cost—letting go of grief—is summarized abstractly rather than paid via a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear task-completion structure without meaningful causal setbacks; the dimension opens simply because the ritual is performed as intended. The closure offers a change of location but lacks a felt cost or decisive turning point, reading as a foregone conclusion rather than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=2.8)
    The plot relies entirely on convenient external forces: a stranger appears at the exact moment and location required to explain the protagonist's destiny. Causality is nonexistent; the narrative admits the events are "orchestrated coincidences," which removes protagonist agency and tension. The closure—a realization of destiny—is unearned because the solution was handed to the protagonist without struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" ending where the device resolves all conflict instantly without cost or consequence. The plot progression is linear and convenient, with clues and solutions (mirrors, currents) appearing exactly when needed without logic or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative is linear and procedural: she arrives, performs a ritual, and succeeds without significant setbacks or deviation. The ending devolves into a summary of future events ("Future wanderers would find...") rather than grounding the closure in the immediate scene, reducing the impact of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.4)
    Causality operates on dream logic that breaks physical plausibility without establishing a magical system; a three-dimensional darkroom timer is somehow wedged into the "column" of a paper bus timetable. The climax relies on an unexplained magical event (the envelope opening itself and scattering "fragments" that become a map), and the ending dissolves into a summarized legend rather than a scene-bound closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative relies on dream logic where "ideas" physically clash without establishing the rules of engagement, making the causality vague. The ending—a "shared destination"—is a soft reset that dissolves the conflict without a decisive change or paid price. The plot structure follows a linear "and then" sequence rather than a tightening coil of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.7)
    The narrative violates the short-story scope by summarizing a year of events rather than dramatizing a specific, pressure-filled scene. There is no inciting incident *in scene*, no rising action against resistance, and the ending is a foregone conclusion lacking cost or distinct closure. The transition from prison to tourist destination breaks all causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.0)
    Causality is governed by dream-logic that breaks coherence; the mechanics of splicing a film reel to create a physical cloud staircase are unintelligible even as surrealism. The narrative moves from image to image without a grounded sense of "because/therefore," making the progression feel arbitrary. Orientation suffers as the spatial relationship between the station, the film reel tunnel, and the cloud arbor is impossible to visualize.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: assignment, ritual, success. The closure creates a "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist succeeds exactly as planned without a complication or paid price, failing the requirement for a felt cost or decisive change that alters the status quo beyond simple plot progression.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative lacks a causal drive or genuine obstacle; it is a linear sequence of ritualistic actions that succeed immediately (whisper -> compass moves -> sky clears). The "closure" is merely the completion of the ritual without a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" born of struggle. Orientation relies on vague fantasy tropes rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust, cracks, humidity, and vines accrete into a pattern that reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s whisper revalues decay—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized on her body or choice, so the RR never quite stings.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: frost pattern → ledger → shards → kiln, each layer reweighting survival into creation; the “scorched testament” recurs as both scar and map, landing in a Charged Poise where the canyon sings back. Cost is visible—the ledger strip sacrificed to the kiln—so closure meets RR criteria. Transitions are legible (fire site → canyon → mine → rim) and orientation is anchored by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the conservatory exhales into song while the device’s steady glow signals a lasting, costly vigil. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (frost, copper lattice, rose-veined glass) thickens until the final chord reweights the silence. Causality is light—no beat narrows options—but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the resonant image, satisfying the lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s “quiet pulse” reweights the premise, making rest a civic act with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: lens cracked by storm → reassembly atop cradle → light pulses coerce tablets to glow → spirits settle. No teleporting props; every beat advances knowledge or narrows options. The persistent constraint—water pressure against fragile glass—shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final dawn image reweights the bell’s echo into a promise that sanctions cannot silence. The causal chain—sanctions → anonymous donations → bell signal → volunteers → next sunrise—tightens once but cleanly. Orientation anchor (ridge, dawn, exile settlement) appears by line 4; no debt. Cost is felt in the “growing number of mouths” and the bell’s lone nightly toll, a audible price that persists. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breath thickens the image-density until the lattice brightens and love spills back into the world. Closure is a Charged Poise—Milo stands at the tunnel mouth while the viaduct blossoms, the cost being the now-dimmed tear and the perpetual openness of “continual revealing.” No causal ambiguity; pattern taught early, paid off in final luminescence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the maze stands complete, photographs gone, scent of memory left—cost is felt. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each sensorial layer dissolves into the next until the final image reweights the stake. The lens holds, but the poem-like drift never tightens once; pressure plateaus rather than escalates, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens is clear: each sensory layer (rose petal vibration, moonbeam ribbon, lantern ignition) deepens the stake of “preserving illuminated moments.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Lira’s whispered promise reweights theft into guardianship with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric rather than strict: the flower-cipher rules are taught early and return to unlock both jade door and thematic mission. One soft spot: the jade door “sighs” open with no prior hint of sentience, a micro-teleport that nicks seamlessness yet doesn’t rupture the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing sphere miniaturizes planetary thaw, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—“the room seemed to breathe.” Yet the causal chain is weak; the consoles flicker alive without prior ignition beat, undercutting earned change. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty, but lens stays Accumulative/Textural, not Causal, limiting escalation tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s “trembling certainty” crystallizes when she drinks amber, foreclosing the old masking self. Cost is felt—“betrayal of the self I had hidden”—and the library’s star-name inversion signals irreversible shift. Causal chain (shell → cipher → lever → amber) holds, but the middle pivot (cipher decoded by stunt-move analogues) is narrated more than tested on-page, muting pressure. Orientation achieved by line 5; lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, no ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map dissolves into “the very air,” reweighting the premise that the void can be known; the cost is the oracle’s surrender of the artifact he trusted, paid in the final breath-image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: because each retelling thickens the parchment’s “veins of shadow,” the final cadence shift (star winks out → map disperses) reconfigures meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored early by “storm-tossed ridge fort” and continuous storm cues; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty applied. No causality gaps; the booklet’s frayed last question is the visible constraint that shapes the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the last auroral data-spiral reweights cleaning into cognition-harvesting with felt cost. Causal chain is thin but coherent under Accumulative lens—each droplet adds density until meaning flips. Orientation clean by 50 words; looped-timeline rule taught early and paid off. Persistent constraint: every future sweep must now listen for latent thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forecourt stones glow with communal honesty, a visible social cost that reweights the town’s rule-set. The lens-path (ticket-doodle → backstage → microphone → projected confessions) is causal and coherent. Orientation is secure by line 3; transitions are smooth. The mayor’s fresh ticket in the final beat nicely tightens the loop, proving the pattern persists, though the cost to Mara personally is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens chosen; the piece teaches its lyric-repetitive cadence early and lands a Charged Poise: garden acknowledges keeper, dew-like recognition felt on skin. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no penalty. Causal linkage is loose—“garden responds” by magic rather than because/therefore—but permissible under the lyric-accumulative mode. Cost is atmospheric, not specific, keeping score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sideways nudge of time reweights the station’s reality and Lira’s worldview, cost legible in the “icy warmth that seeped into every conduit.” Causal chain holds: twilight nexus → holographic lattice → lever pull → amber arcs → flora bloom + bird ascent. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no penalty. One meaningful tightening: the stillness of the aviary crystallizes the moment of sideways slip. Lens is Causal, held without wobble to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the sustained note reconfigures meaning, the lanterns steady, the program dries—undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern is taught early (water droplets = staff lines) and lands cleanly. No orientation debt; space, time, and POV anchor by line 3. Causality is mythic but internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the smudged illustration reweights meaning and the stone’s weight is conceptually repriced when the console number matches it—felt cost is legible. Structure is single-scene, single POV, within word count; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3. One meaningful deepening—humidity lines emerging from smudge—tightens the stake. No causal reversals, but pattern holds; minor slack: “she adjusted the station’s barometer by a fraction” is told, not shown, blunting the final beat’s causality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mara’s refusal lets the swallowed truth stay buried while the tunnel “breathes” and the ghost shift withdraws—cost is felt in the transferred weight to his ribs. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the numeric pattern derived from radio fragments tightens the stake and reweights the valve’s meaning without requiring external plot turns. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“rusted artery…beneath the moon”) and never clouds. One soft spot: the foreman’s live-radio confession is backstory delivered in a late reflective block; because it never limits present options, the reveal feels convenient rather than earned by prior scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the keeper records “silence births renewal,” accepting perpetual witness and relinquishing the chance to intervene, while the regenerative silence is felt as a conceptual cost inside the obsidian refuge. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each chamber thickens sensory density until the river reweights the premise; the origami swan pattern is taught early and paid off as the final reprise. Orientation is clean by line 6; no causal contradiction mars the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the eclipse pattern intensifies mood and the curl re-appears to create Charged Poise. Yet the decisive reconfiguration (“world reborn in the echo of the song”) is declared, not embodied; no tangible price is shown, so closure feels cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of humming, dragons, axis-echo builds density until the final Charged Poise (“the world whose axis has been gently shifted”). Causality is lyric, not consequential—each find (diary, tapestry, glyph) adds resonance rather than narrows tactical options. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure lands with conceptual cost—axis realignment as irreversible perceptual shift—so lens holds, but the lack of a tangible forfeit keeps it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure is present: a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the cookies as propagators of encoded destinies. Yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the causal chain between microdot specs, ink spiral, and reader transformation is elliptically summarized rather than shown; the “visitor” beat arrives late and anonymous, blurring who undergoes the decisive change. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the pivot from accidental to deliberate prophecy is told, not demonstrated, softening the because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the indigo flare exposes “hidden assumptions that had shackled the city’s heart,” re-weighting the world-rule. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of echo, color, and silence tightens until the stillness shatters. Orientation is immediate (“a waning cathedral that floated between worlds”). Minor causality gap: the anchor’s shift from threat to beacon is asserted, not shown, but the final image still carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fractured mirrored horizon reconfigures meaning and forecloses return to prior silence, cost legible in the cascading shards. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern taught early by nautilus-as-compass holds. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are intact by word 60. The slight causal gap between memory-mapping and the lake’s actual sonic transformation keeps the lens from full causal purity, but the resonant reconfiguration satisfies under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the tablet dissolves, timelines reseal—but causality is lyric-associative rather than because/therefore. The procedural-generation engine is asserted, never demonstrated; we never watch an algorithm output constrain a decision. Orientation is lyrically delayed yet ultimately functional; waiver applies. Accumulation cap −0.8 for two distinct non-closure issues: (1) teleporting tablet dissolution solves the climax without prior setup, (2) “fractured timelines” declared but never narrow options on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s “mirrored hush” becomes Charged Poise—silence now reflects feeling, foreclosing Marin's prior detachment. Causal lens holds: because she plays reversed songs → filament glows; therefore she flips to forward → pressure bursts → heartbeat returns. Orientation clean by line 3; single scene, no prop drift. Cost is legible—“warming the cold that had settled there for years”—but not persistently constraining after exit; keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she seals the tube, accepting that her chronicles will now travel by pigeon-air, not human courier; the price is the audible city gates slamming shut behind her. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated “layered tranquility” and dusk imagery tighten until the final moment reweights solitude as active resistance, not retreat. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and stay stable. No causality breaks; the shaft decision is foreshadowed by merchants’ spices.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory stratum layers density until the final ultraviolet flare reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—lantern in twilight, crystal shadows clinging—visible cost legible as perpetual custodianship of sorrow. No orientation drift; greenhouse, vial, Arlen anchored by word 80. Transitions absent, satisfying single-scene default. The soft cap at 8.8 is owed to absence of persistent external constraint beyond self-appointed archivist duty.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: rope bound to stone in the final breath, sealing past and future with visible luminescent cost. Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of light/shadow and rope spirals—holds from first sentence to last, reweighting meaning without causal reversal. Orientation anchored by word 40 (“terra-cotta grotto under starlight”); no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: once knotted, the rope can’t be retrieved, foreclosing both poet and beings from rewriting memory.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of echo, ash, and un-binding is taught early; closure lands as Charged Poise—the final reframing of “unfinished” as canvas carries undeniable conceptual cost under the dominant stake. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is delivered by line 3; no teleport or amnesia. One meaningful tightening: the bowl’s chord reweights silence into hum, foreclosing the option of absolute quiet. Cost is legible in the final image of stars reflected in still-humming copper.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the grotto’s whisper and the sealed vial reweight the entire emotional economy, making the commodification of feeling legible and irreversible. Causal lens holds: each step (rub→inhale→seal) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—“the amber glow sealing the static charge inside”—a permanent, sellable scar.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Conceptual Repricing: the locket glows on the balcony while townspeople read fishermen’s stories, implying a new communal valence. Causal linkage is loose—Mara’s walk and speech act accomplish the symbolic return, but the story never tests her shrewdness or risks her profit ledger, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Mosaic structure (library → pier → lighthouse → library) is legible and pattern-taught early; transitions are anchored by sensory callbacks (brine, starlight, paper scent). Orientation holds throughout; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tag is revealed as living, the orchard’s ache steadies into glow, and every heart feels bound. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the lens holds because the final reweighting of the glyph from static mark to growing symbol is legible and cost is felt (the community now carries perpetual responsibility). Orientation is clear by word 60. No teleporting props or plot amnesia, but the off-stage street artist remains a convenient oracle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer (canal-veins, giant’s nap, luminous echoes) thickens the texture until the final cadence stabilizes. Orientation anchors arrive by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a legitimate Charged Poise: Mira walks away across silver water, the city’s rhythm restored, her personal cost legible as perpetual service to time’s sculpture. Persistent constraint (she is now the echo, sketching forever) shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test for cost; kept below 8.8 because the renunciation beat is slightly abstract rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equation “grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth” is legible in the final petal-fall, satisfying the RR/CR requirement with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: droplet-notes, crack-patterns, and petal-rain build density until meaning reweights; no because/therefore turns are required. Orientation is clear by sentence four; no spatial or temporal drift. The single-scene default is met; no prop or motif breaks continuity. A tighter micro-turn between eyes-on-stone and petal-release would sharpen inevitability, but the arc coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story delivers a clean Charged Poise closure: the blue glow reweights the premise, making her visible to commuters at undeniable social cost—she steps from shadow into stewardship. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than twist-driven; every beat layers the tape’s resonance until the final image crystallizes option and cost in one breath. The “sapphire hush” motif is seeded early and returns charged, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of release/nudge repeats until chlorophyll unfurls, reweighting meaning. Orientation clean by line 3; transitions are single-scene dissolves, not shards. Closure is a Charged Poise: “promise to keep watching” crystallizes stance with conceptual cost—his science will stay humble. Minor slack: middle beats (storm as metronome, “documented”) feel additive rather than intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece lands a clean Charged Poise closure: the mist-varnished cliffs and hung-up brooch reconfigure Mara’s palette into “a single, trembling note of hope,” cost visible in the surrendered canvases. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the rain-trail pattern is taught early and holds to the final image; no orientation drift. Slight over-reliance on declarative summary in the climax keeps it from full 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cave becomes living instrument, Lira accepts steady unpredictability, cost is conceptual (future still unseen). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—images layer rather than cause—but orientation is soft: “the pilgrim” arrives unnamed, time is “after,” space is dream-stable. One meaningful tightening—amber tear transmutes shadows to ribbons—yet causality is poetic, not tactical. Pattern is legible, but payoff drifts into choral abstraction rather than a choice that forecloses path.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dock’s fragment layers density until the brass chamber’s reprise reweights the stake from private archive to communal map. Orientation lands by word 30 (“ivory harbor after rain”), causality is wave-by-wave accumulation, not because/therefore chains. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sunrise chord releases a communal meaning whose conceptual cost—no single author, no final draft—is legible in “a map of the night’s journey that no single voice could have sketched alone.” No artifact obscures the final image; the lens holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the archive’s weight rather than causing next events. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—the city’s unspoken maps now route through her—visible in the final image of cracks realigning; cost is the lifelong guardianship she accepts in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the tile’s steady glow and the whales’ vanishing arcs crystallize a new rule—doubt can coexist with wonder if surrendered to shared memory. Causality holds: each tile rearrangement is triggered by Lira’s recalled memory, and the final alignment is earned by her transcription act. Cost is legible in the penultimate clause: “rare peace settle in her bones,” a felt forfeiture of certainty. The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and holds; only the Orientation Test is waived because the lyrical disorientation pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: goodbye reframed as spatial pivot, dust motes carrying felt cost. Causal chain is thin—amulet magnetically “tugs” and he simply follows—yet the accumulative pattern of corridors and mirrored self supplies enough textural linkage to satisfy the lens. Orientation is swift; spatial rules remain consistent. Still, the decisive change is 90% realization, 10% agency, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal linkage holds: because asylum officials demand proof → therefore Mara must activate the ink → because the ink answers grief-laden atmosphere → therefore contract glows and walls of rigidity dissolve. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost—bureaucratic rule-set rewritten by alchemical equity, “calm, equitable breath” legible as RR. Slight short of 9.0 only because the commission’s reaction is reported in a single sentence rather than dramatized beat, softening the Decisive Change edge.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the bonsai inhale the lamp’s hum, reweighting invented histories as bridges; cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is accumulative/textural—density of light-notes tightens until meaning refracts; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by word 40. One soft spot: the “town silent” device is declared, never pressed or paid for, so external stakes feel ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the label’s glow projects erased histories and reweights the port into a “museum of vanished moments,” cost felt in the “cold filament” against steel. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of layered fragments, sepia filter, tide-metronome—held without contradiction. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 30 (“towering labyrinth of shipping containers… sea’s tide”), so no penalty. One tightens at the high-tide projection that forecloses the option of forgetting; persistent constraint is the narrator’s voided identity that enables the archival role. Meets 9+ quick test; only a hairline lack of causal ripple keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass is revealed as living melody, reweighting her myth-busting project into stewardship of wonder. Causal chain is loose—shell → hum → ledger → insight—yet the accumulative/textural pattern is taught early and paid off in the final chord. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; the single transition (attic → cliff descent) is legible. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the phoenix mural visibly reweights the privatization stakes and the city’s self-image, with the chip enshrined as communal anchor—cost is legible. Causality, however, is loose: graffiti cartography turns tides without on-page resistance failure or council vote mechanics; the postponement reads like civic benevolence rather than Mira’s earned lever. Accum/Textural lens holds—density of coded murals patterns toward the final image—but the single “because” hinge (investors arrive → layout already shifted) is asserted, not dramatized. Orientation clear by 50 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the shutter-click final image reweights the entire quest, turning archival duty into private grief. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each chemical, geological, and lunar cue stacks until the blackening film triggers the camera; the chain never breaks. Orientation is effortless—moonlit summit, visor, tripod planted by line 4—so the reader is anchored before the first hundred words elapse. The only drag is a 60-word reflective lull mid-text that slows rather than tightens, keeping the piece just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is a Charged Poise where the hummingbird’s hover crystallizes Mara’s invisible navigation into a conceptual cost—her precision forever ships out while she stays. Anchor triad (who/where/when) locked by line 3; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—her blindness—shapes every tactic and charges the final image of the drone leaving the depot without her.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the falcon-shadow over the first vein of open water crystallizes the before/after of the thaw, cost felt in the bell clang and boot-cracks. Causality holds: glass condensation → transmitter glyph → bell toll, each because/therefore. The falcon-return rule is taught early and repaid at the last image, so orientation waiver applies; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the “balance” is declared restored in the final image of fluttering awnings humming with the fork’s memory, giving a conceptual cost (the tuner walks away, his job done). Causality is poetic-accumulative rather than strict: imagined footsteps → stones reseat, repeated across paragraphs until the town breathes again. While this lens is internally consistent, the missing orientation (who is the tuner, where exactly, when is “before the collapse”?) blurs the stakes until mid-story; the waiver applies because the lyric pattern does pay off, but the early drift still weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure is a declared Conceptual Repricing rather than an on-page image with cost; the vial merely “glowed faintly” and the world “inhaled” in summary. Causality loops: the temple first demands the beacon be let fade, then later returns the vial anyway—no persistent constraint. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence repeats prior perfume imagery without tightening. Orientation acceptable; who/where anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: he stands on the balcony, hush settled, lighthouse now beacon of truth—cost is the lifelong alarms he must keep silent. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative: lattice pulse → corridor → map → reef → bodies rise; each beat because/therefore advances knowledge rather than external stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“lighthouse prison”) so the early lyric haze is waived. One transition only (cell → corridor) and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bead pulsing “with a soft, mournful elation” reconfigures the orchard and the reader’s sense of debt forever. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each ghostly visit layers resonance until the final breath crystallizes meaning. The Orientation Test is waived; the early lyric disorientation is taught and pays off in the translucent glass walls. Cost is undeniable—her extinction fertilizes the blossoms—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s meaning flips from ruin to reverence via luminous sewn corridors, cost legible in the guildmasters’ humbled kneeling. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each dream-stitch layers density until the pattern ruptures the prohibition. However, orientation of time and physical logic of the “overlapping sleepwalking paths” remain fuzzy past the 120-word mark; the waiver is not earned because the payoff does not resolve the disorientation, so −0.3 applied.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each unearthed shard thickens the sacred density until the final click of the sundial base reweights the orchard into a living shrine. Orientation is clean (“stepped through the stone portal” by line 1); causality is lyric rather than tight because/therefore yet the pattern is taught early and closure lands as Charged Poise—the silver circle alignment and bone-chime crystallize options for future pilgrims. Cost is felt: Mara’s solitary labor, the scholars who vanished, and the orchard’s reclaimed voice. One hairline slip: the “quiet voice” literalizes the magic rather than leaving it in poised ambiguity, else 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drone-lift reconfigures meaning and carries conceptual cost (“encoded hope”). Causality is lyric-accumulative; the chalk glyphs tighten into pulse, but the mailbox-on-rooftop reveal is introduced late and never constrained prior tactics. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Track A single-scene arc lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stitched chart leaves the observatory, irreversibly exposing the coup. Causal lattice holds—every ember flicker maps to a conspirator step, tightening knowledge until the courier departs. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear within 60 words and recapitulate at courier hand-off. Cost is legible in the final image: “the ember, now a memory, faded into ash.” Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each beat layers condensation, song, and shard-glow until the apology vaporizes into fireflies—an earned Charged Poise. Orientation is lyric-delayed yet justified; the “mangrove labyrinth” serves the final image, so waiver applies. Cost is legible in the shard’s warmth and the firefly transference; persistent constraint (moonlight healing) shapes every tactical placement of the shard. One soft spot: the breeze that knocks the glass is external coincidence, not an because/therefore linkage, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral droplet reweights the child’s wound into living tissue, cost felt in the “lotus-hearted ache.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each swirl deciphered adds density until the mist chorus crystallizes; no causal turn is required. Orientation is complete by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The final image cleanly reconfigures meaning, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the fragment dissolves into starlight while the orchard “breathes.” The cost is conceptual (she gives up the last relic) but not felt—no tactile beat of loss, no ripple in the network. Accumulative lens holds: each brushstroke layers luminosity until the fog thins. Yet the escalation is weightless; nothing narrows or breaks, so the reconfiguration feels decorative rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the nickel’s etched surface reweights curiosity over certainty with visible artifact-cost. Causality, however, is accumulative/lyric, not causal: the “because” between sound-mural-awakening is poetic simultaneity rather than motivated sequence. The garden’s rules are taught early enough, but the drift into lyrical patterning weakens the lens clarity at the very end, nudging the score below the 7+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse becomes a living cipher, cost felt in the shift from private rebellion to shared network. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; each seedling spiral reweights knowledge rather than narrows physical options. Orientation is clean by 50 words; no lens ambiguity. Lacks one persistent constraint that would push it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early—each stanza-layer thickens reef-light—and holds it to the Charged Poise ending where star-pollen settles on the shell-walls, re-weighting centuries of longing. Causality is lyric rather than sequential: the postcard’s arrival doesn’t change tactics, it catalyzes denser imagery. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“gargantuan shell half buried beneath a turquoise reef”), but the centuries-long span is handled in summary, diluting the before/after snap required for a Decisive Change. Closure is resonant yet conceptual; the cost is cosmic, not personal—so the required “felt” price arrives only as shimmer, not wound.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of nightly ritual → traveler arrival → rekindled echo. Closure is a Charged Poise (caretaker resumes, now with traveler-carried names) and carries conceptual cost—her labor is endless. Orientation is swift; transitions are fluid within the single shard. No meaningful tightening inside the ritual itself; escalation is additive, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece lands a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is restored and silence rewritten into dialogue, with the archive’s audible breath as undeniable social cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each promise-layer thickens resonance until the final chord reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate; transitions are unnecessary in this single-scene design. The “before paths diverge” ticking clock is named but not tracked, a hairline slip that keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: adhesive trace → binary map → chain calibration → floodgate turn, each beat because/therefore tightening the council schism until the valve’s first breath reweights options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s water will now “speak” through empathy-engineered pressure, a conceptual cost felt as the ash “aligns.” No orientation debt; spatial anchors land by line 4. Minor scaffold (“the moment the wheel turned”) survives the peak beat without dulling the image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural pattern early—dust spirals → paper trails → pigeon routes—and holds it to the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 40 words; the skylight and attic function as micro-setting. Closure is a Charged Poise: the glowing map on the wall crystallizes the braid of memory and renewal, cost felt in the chip’s fading light. The lens never wavers, but the cost is mildly abstract; a single bird failure or returned note could have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the threshold is revealed as a collapse of distance into memory, felt cost in the scent of corn husk that replaces maternal breath. Causal chain holds: copper vibration → grain map → glass corridor → sunrise exit, each because/therefore tightening knowledge. Orientation is taught early—terrace, amber field, late sun—so the later spiral downward remains legible. One micro-turn suffices: hidden seam yields corridor, shifting stakes from escape to guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—she exits with sky-maps and sunrise—but the cost is purely lyrical; no prior option is foreclosed. Causal chain is loose: because she inhales fireflies, therefore the city awakens is magical logic without constraint. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, so no penalty, yet escalation remains atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the fissure is stitched, bridge restored, and the rose-colored sigh reweights the premise—paths reappear only when emotional resonance is paid. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seed-hue thickens pattern until the mosaic heartbeat tightens the rift. Cost is legible in the final amber sunrise spreading across the floor—memory’s fragility now has a visible scar.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every repetition of bishop-ink-water adds density until the violin’s final chord reweights the whole pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—the twin bishops glinting under neon while the tide erases the X—so the cost is conceptual (beauty’s impermanence) but undeniable. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored inside the first 60 words. Causality remains loose, appropriate to the lens, yet each beat forecloses nothing so the tightening is cadential rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the inked stanza pulses, exile reframes into pilgrimage, and moonstone dust seeds the world—cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagistic repetition (tide, dust, ink) tightens toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; causality is loose but coherent under lyric logic. No meaningful tightening beat narrows options, so escalation stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the nets become “jeweled crowns,” reweighting the mundane under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior-pattern rather than event, but the final image crystallizes meaning with visible cost—the harbor’s ledger is “balanced,” implying future reckonings. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it, satisfying the mosaic exception.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the gauge mirror-image reweights the premise (hope=measurable). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each balloon layers a data-point that patterns the final zero. Cost is social, not personal, but legible in the villagers’ overnight shoreline re-decoration; the lens stays coherent. However, the middle relies on declarative summary (“he recorded each movement”) rather than scene, softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative pattern (film → diary → negative → soundmap) teaches itself by 25 % and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor’s exhale re-weights every prior echo as a living lullaby. Cost is legible in the final line—“she can still hear the faint dream hum”—a persistent auditory obligation she now carries. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Only the late crowd of visiting scholars feels like a soft add-on that slightly dilutes the single-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Closure is a visual fireworks display—mirrors spill doors of spring—but the mirrors were never established as resistant, so persuasion carries no cost or before/after shift. The text is accumulative/textural; the single intensification (bells finally toll) is pretty but does not reweight options for the painter or the world, only confirms success already achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: swords atop the altar reconfigure the stalemate into fragile covenant, the ebony sheet glowing under starlight makes the conceptual cost undeniable, and the lens is Accumulative—the slow layering of offerings, clauses, and blades tightens until the terrace itself becomes treaty. Causality is lyric rather than plot-engine; each beat adds density rather than reversals, and the final image rewards that pattern. One minor causality wobble: the hymn is introduced only in the last sentence, so its emotional freight feels appended rather than seeded. Nevertheless, the reader traces a legible before/after in the same spatial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the salt-flat amplifier captures the extinct wing-beat echo, reconfiguring the philanthropist’s cruelty into a lasting spectral artwork. Causal chain holds: engineered drought → cracked map → brine amplifier → egg release → preserved echo; each step tightens options. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by line 3: “stood alone on the cracked salt flat as the sky bruised...” Cost is legible in the final image—he walks away having seeded an immortal guilt/artifact. No lens ambiguity; pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because she loathes the lullaby, she enters the courtyard; because she untangles threads, the sanctuary yields its chorus; because that chorus spills outward, the city wakes. The final beat—“rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn”—delivers a crisp Conceptual Repricing that makes the before/after legible. One hairline slip: the golden thread appears only at the instant it is released, so its cost is more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the reversed string image reweights the whole puppet metaphor and carries conceptual cost (“grant autonomy”), satisfying Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens. Causality is loose—why the dome, why tonight, remains atmospheric rather than motivated—but the pattern of mirrored light → reversed dish → reversed string teaches its logic early and pays it off in the final glow. Orientation is taught by “rusted cathedral” inside 120 words; no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—each reed knot and glow-pulse adds density—then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fading dawn etches “a lingering knot of light” that reweights all prior signals. Causality is interior but coherent: because she ties, the grove remembers; because the monarch leaves, the structure must dissolve—cost is felt in the dimming moss. Orientation is clear within 50 words and closure image pays off the “interrupted cadence” motif. Only the thinnest external stakes cap it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s new luminous map re-weights memory’s value and carries conceptual cost—the sanctum is now a living archive. Causality, however, is soft: the rope’s re-braiding succeeds on the first attempt, no loop snaps, no alternative is foreclosed, so the “before/after” feels gifted rather than fought for. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and cadence escalate—but the single tightening beat is the same as the final image, so escalation and resolution collapse into one glow. Still, the image itself is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagistic repetition (vine/seal/storm) layers density until the vortex rewrites the directive. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the seal levitates and new paths ignite, reweighting the premise. Cost is conceptual (old directive decayed, new walkers chosen), but because the POV only watches, the price feels environmental rather than intimate; still, it is legible. Orientation is lyrical-disorienting, yet pattern teaches early enough to waive penalty; causality is poetic accumulation, not strict because/therefore, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the violet bridge reweights the palace, grain stores, and Nabu’s future charts in one image; “cosmic ledger” is the visible cost. Causal chain holds—tile discovery → schematic translation → celestial alignment → covenant click—each step narrows options. The lens is Causal, unbroken to the last line. Orientation is anchored by 50 words; no ambiguity, no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the music box’s vanishing pin leaves the monks (and later the wanderer) carrying cellular peace—an earned stasis with conceptual cost—under an accumulative lens. Causality is present yet light: the box reappears because a needy hand touches it, not because Mara’s tactics tighten; this coincidence-complication is acceptable under the lyric pattern taught early. Orientation is swift and the two-shard structure (monks → wanderer) is legible; no mechanics break.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each breathing cycle adds silvered density until the mirror ripples and the sextant sings—closure is a Charged Poise where orchard, dream, and maker share one pulse. Causality is metaphoric but coherent: breath welds light, fog seals brass, dream coils home. Cost is visible—“the world seemed to melt” while he anchors—so Resonant Reconfiguration lands. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props; one steady escalation suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the repaired lenses and tightened ribbon reconfigure both vision and legacy with undeniable felt cost (she must keep returning). Causality holds on Accumulative/Textural lens—each stroke of ink/amber adds density until the final chime. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when). No.teleporting props; the ribbon snag seeds the bag-contents payoff. One minor softness: the breach itself is off-stage, but the narrative treats it as lived pressure, not outline hole.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: pressing the shell projects the constellation map, making the inherited loop visible and charging the asteroid ground. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the orchard’s answers dissolve-then-reassemble, teaching the pattern early and paying off in the final image, so the lens holds with poetic coherence. The cost is conceptual but legible—he relinquishes linear life-narrative—and the mosaic tile pulse crystallizes the reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the store’s unheard symphony thickens via each discovered gap, but the causal glue is weak. The floor collapses because “the third gap” is reached, not because Selene’s agency triggers it. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the scrolls teaching silence—but the cost is only lyrical, not lived. Orientation is quick; however, the teleporting props (portal, diary page) and off-stage lock-picking keep the chain of consequence thin.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ink-river, blooming verbs, and glowing card reweights meaning at close. Orientation is taught by deliberate fog-disorientation that pays off when bay reveals fleet; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise—garden found, fleet waiting—felt cost is the eternal custodian burden now assumed; lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is legible: seal → rope → door vanishes, but the actual trigger is magical hand-waving (“latent enchantment”) rather than a pressure-forced choice. Closure lands as Charged Poise—clock frozen, door gone—yet the cost is only atmospheric; Mara forfeits nothing and gains no new knowledge, so the repricing is conceptual, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: ice-crack map → tunnel opens → stone retrieved → hush blooms → beings dim → repose restored. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caves’ new quiet is legible, the stone’s steady pulse an audible metronome of peace, and the mapkeeper’s whispered promise shows future vigilance as cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“deepest chamber”); no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: “he had been waiting after the energy beings arrive” flattens tense; still, causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—beacon lit, travelers arriving—image reweights premise with undeniable social hope, but cost is only asserted (“refuses to be crushed”), not dramatized. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated star/prism alignments accumulate until cadence shifts at lantern kiss; pattern taught early and coherent. Orientation clean within 120 words; no causality breaks, yet no persistent constraint priced on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: rain-crystal-shadow pattern accretes meaning until the sunrise reweights it. Closure is a Charged Poise—archivist turns back to engrave the insight—so a conceptual cost is legible, but the price is collective, not personal, softening punch. Orientation is clear by line 20; no teleporting props, yet the middle sags in repetitive static observation beats that feel like and-then sequencing rather than pressure turns.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens holds: each chant/spark layers density until the mosaic tile glows. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—night sky re-priced as canvas—but emotional cost is only asserted (“gravity of hopelessness lift”). Orientation clean by 120 words; spatial logic survives lyric drift. Final vow is redundant denouement after the image has already closed.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the water’s new clarity mirrors the softened dialogue, a CR that reweights the premise without moralizing. Causality is accumulative/textural: ripple images accumulate until the cicada’s final glow crystallizes the shift. Orientation is secure within 60 words; lens holds. Cost is felt—the chronicler’s “whispered gratitude” admits her conduit role—but lacks a concrete price, capping the score just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: gravity snaps back, filaments dissolve, and Lio re-enters the bunker carrying an internalized “gilded hush,” re-weighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: because he limits exposure, each silence stays pure; therefore he gains an portable sky inside stone. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The single shard design meets Track A defaults. Minor knock: the doll’s earlier utility is summarized (“his mother told him”) rather than dramatized, a micro-setup softness that keeps it from the 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer (prism song, brass ear, storm-glass hues) thickens the hush rather than forcing causal turns. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise—silver droplets become soundless bells—reconfiguring the stake from “transit” to “peace carried within.” The cost is conceptual, not visceral, but still legible on the page. Minor loop: “vaulting hush” is reused three times without pattern-taught escalation, dulling the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a classic Charged Poise: the throne’s hum fuses orchard roots with city data-streams, re-pricing Mina’s world-rule in one image. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught by recurring chromatic light and flake-pulse, paid off when both merge into the throne-gleam. Cost is undeniable—she is forever bridge between analog and digital, alone at pixel sunrise. Lens holds; noorientation debt; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the threshold flips from barrier to bridge—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration—and the ring’s relinquishment makes the cost visible and irreversible. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-sequential; the pattern is taught early (“each burnt span left a scar”) and deepens through luminous vein imagery until the starlit corridor reconfigures meaning. Orientation is never in doubt—who, where, when are anchored within the first 60 words—so no penalty applies. The lens holds without contradiction, though the escalation is more atmospheric intensification than narrowing options; sufficient for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bolt’s diamonds crystallize, reweighting the premise that pressure = value, and the farm’s ledger now glows—visible conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mushroom glow, glitch texts, and diamond bloom builds to a cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation is quick; no teleporting props. The one soft spot: the quantum-concept rule is asserted rather than tested in a mid-scene failure, so the final turn feels lightly pre-ordained rather than earned through a prior tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the scroll reweights dynasty myth into moral failure, producing Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each standing-wave beat thickens pattern until the floorboard reveal—but the middle relies on repeated “listening” beats that slightly stall escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of vapor, script, moss, spores layers until the knight’s armor dissolves into living tapestry—an earned stasis with visible cost. Orientation is late (~140 words) but the disorientation pays off in closure, so waiver applies. The script-unfurl beat supplies the decisive reconfiguration; cost is felt in the bodily merger.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the button’s glow reweights the archive’s meaning and forecloses Amelia’s detachment. Causality, however, is soft: sunlight angle and dust choreography arrive as lucky external choreography rather than because/therefore chains she triggers. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The non-closure flaw is the lack of a visible cost paid by Amelia inside the final beat—her stance crystallizes but we do not feel what she forfeits or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the transmission reweights public memory, cost legible in “ghosts they ignored.” Causal lens holds; each beat (key salvage → map read → broadcast) links by therefore. Micro-weakness: the map’s liquid-memory rule is introduced late, barely taught, yet powers climax.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical repetition tightens the stake by dissolving the code into mist. Closure is a Charged Poise—the final veil of hush settles with conceptual cost: the valley spared but the musician forever bound to return. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous script cascade reweights the grove into a living archive, cost felt in her irreversible perceptual merger; causality is Accumulative/Textural—each leaf-reading deepens pattern rather than forcing because/therefore turns—held cleanly to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: courier drop → greenhouse test → tunnel → cavern → inscription; each step because/therefore. Closure is Charged Poise rather than decisive act—the compass on the brazier reweights her craft with conceptual cost (“let uncertainty guide”). Spatial orientation is complete by line 10; time anchor (“damp morning”) arrives even earlier. Minor slack: the orange flicker is introduced seconds before use, but the image still crystallizes options neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure earns Earned Stasis: the crack is sealed, the name accepted, the path of infinite measurement foreclosed by the visible gold seam. Causal chain holds: whispered name → crack widens → gold flows → coin balanced; each step is traceable under the Causal lens. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by word 30. One minor scaffold: “continuous negotiation with the limits she set upon herself” abstracts a beat that already happened. Cost is felt in the final image: she walks into rain carrying both the restored coin and the unvanished regret—two weights now cohabiting.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early through repeating echo/laughter motifs and holds to the end; closure arrives as a Charged Poise—the gorge hums with repurposed grief—so the lens is coherent. Orientation is secured by word 60, well inside the 120-word safe-zone. The decisive change (joke → laughter → tooth ignites) is on-page and charged with conceptual cost: the gorge’s acoustic ecology is permanently altered. Causality is loose but pattern-true; no teleporting props or retro-patching.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each violet pulse deepens pattern rather than forcing causal turns. Orientation is swift—UV forest, post-anesthesia body, mask strap all appear by line 4. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the strap’s shift from shackle to beacon reweights the entire pattern, cost is the lingering burn on skin. No teleporting props; strap and light states track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: fragment’s vanishment re-weights city lights into “constellation of stories,” cost paid in tangible forfeiture and crystallized stance. Accumulative lens—pattern of painted clues, pulse-images—holds; cadence shift from crowded market to lone balcony crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no lens ambiguity. One causal micro-gap: chain unfastens without spelled transfer of agency from translator to artifact, but pulse-forfeiture covers cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative-textural lens: dust-to-diagram, barrel-to-heartbeat, ledger-to-acknowledgment. Closure is a Charged Poise—the attic hatch silhouette stays open, ghost gratitude settled—so cost is atmospheric, not personal. Orientation is clear by line 15; transitions are smooth. The beat sequence is discovery→mapping→retrieval, each layer thickening texture rather than narrowing options, and the final image reweights earlier motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice reconfigures the library and the page hums with bottled whisper, giving undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain, however, is elliptical: the frost spiral method appears only at the final beat, so the “how” of compression feels retro-fitted. Orientation is crisp within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds, but the late arrival of the spiral technique keeps this from 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s refracted light rewrites the asteroid’s DNA while Lira pockets its sliver as perpetual cost. The “time-becomes-visible” ellipse is taught early, paid off when the storm-mirror mosaic irreversibly frescoes the halls. Causality is lyric but legible—because she covers the mirrors, therefore the elders’ dispute dissolves into collaborative chorus. The persistent constraint is that every future visitor carries away literal fragments of the story; the ending image hums with that ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by patterned sound motifs and holds to closure: density of rust, brass, ticking increases until the lattice brightens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chip’s silver threads visibly re-price the covenant’s meaning on-page. Cost is legible in the final “soft sigh” and the tower’s new audible hum, but the mayor’s early exposition of the honesty rule is never tested in scene, so the change feels narratively rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (petrichor, compass pulse, water-stair) deepens the density of the “resonant hush” until Mara’s stance crystallizes in wordless surrender. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vortex ingests the compass and re-weights meaning—explanations are abdicated, not solved—so cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is clear by line 8; no causal reversals are required under this lens. One minor scald: the lagoon’s physics (walkable water) is sprung without prior rule-teach, but the lyric pattern absorbs it without causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm, slide, arch, and wood accrue meaning until a charged poise crystallizes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—the driftwood compass sculpture and the crowd’s “unseen pull” reconfigure Mira’s stance—but the cost is only implied (“mission fulfilled”) rather than felt on-page. Orientation is clear by 120 words (storm arch, failed GPS, lantern slide). Causality remains loose: the slide’s visions do not narrow options so much as decorate the arch; escalation is atmospheric, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral prism reweights the world’s rule—night blooming is a communal promise, not a mystery to solve—leaving Mara in Charged Poise with the cost being her surrendered skepticism. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each postcard adds refractive memory-density until the glass garden ignites. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; single transition from pavilion to cathedral is legible. One soft spot: the “bridge” mechanism is asserted rather than shown in mid-action, slightly blurring the therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the desert sky becomes a public archive, the brass panels glowing violet with undeniable social cost. Causal chain is tight—letters → diary → code → lagoon → crystal → sky-broadcast—each because/therefore step forecloses retreat. The retrocognitive rule (diary opens only if reader “remembers the future”) is taught early and paid off when Mara’s literal future-memory releases the crystal. Persistent constraint: once stories ride the horn, they can’t be recaptured; Mara’s authority as archivist is simultaneously fulfilled and dissolved.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the town’s lanterns ignite and the alchemist walks away, leaving the bottle empty—an image that reweights the premise (memory > magic). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: lantern-glow, sigh, and bottle mist layer density until the final cadence shift. Causality is metaphoric rather than sequential, acceptable under the lens, but the middle beats repeat the same motion (“he imagined… he imagined…”) without tightening options. Cost is present (he leaves, bottle spent), yet the price feels diffuse because the town’s revival is imagined, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the accidental prophecy becomes a deliberate promise preserved, reweighting the council’s emotional archive forever. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent→sound→ink layers—held to the final image. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. The wax shaving’s second use (tone curling through branches) is the tightening beat that reconfigures stakes. Cost is legible: the scribe’s own ink becomes bodily tribute, sealing the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: time-texture thickens through returning images (acorn → seed, frost → mist → gears) until meaning reconfigures. Orientation is swift: “icebound atrium under starlight” plus Mira’s mission land before word 50. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time becomes weaveable “thread” she can plant; the aurora glow is the conceptual cost, making borrowed-time stewardship irrevocable. Causality is loose (vortex mechanics asserted, not tested), yet the pattern teaches itself early and holds through the lyric cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensor data, drying glue, bell’s first new note layer density until the cadence shift lands. Closure is a Charged Poise: the bell’s low tone reweights the premise, cost felt in the gathered silence. Causality intact; no orientation debt. Glue-drying timer and microclimate threshold provide concrete constraints that shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each traced star adds density, the lantern’s glow reweights meaning until the final ribbon binds sky and stone. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the amber wash—cost is felt as “dawn arrived within,” a conceptual but undeniable shift. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks. One soft spot: the ground tremor response is told, not shown, blunting the decisive beat by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accretive lyric pattern holds: each paragraph adds a spectral or chromatic layer that reweights the covenant. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—amber tear reseals pact—whose cost is aesthetic, not lived. Because no causal turn narrows his tactical options, the lens stays Accumulative/Textural; the piece meets that contract, but barely. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each garage-sale relic thickens the pattern until the map of memory-threads reweights the valley’s time. The urn-as-key turn is crisp, but the capsule’s “intentional damage” is told post-fact, blunting the causal bite of the final click. Cost is scenic (villagers receive notes) rather than personally paid by Mara, so the closure is resonant but not decisive under the strict cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: feather-lily-verse pattern tightens into the burnished-hush tableau. Closure is a Charged Poise that reweights “incomplete” from flaw to hymn, with conceptual cost legible in the final star-image. Transitions are seamless; no Orientation Test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decree lifts because Mara’s “willingness of all beings to bind together” has revalued time itself. Causality is soft—no clear link between copper resonance and revoked sentence—but the accumulative pattern (each coil tightens communal belief) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; only two shards (dawn wiring → council gathering) with a seamless half-year ellipses. Cost is felt: her six-month death clock evaporates yet she stands “tall,” implying life bought by orchard symbiosis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tower’s new rhythm reweights “home” from place to pattern, with felt cost in the expended amber glow. Causality is accumulative/textural: amber droplets → chemical signature → tower response; the pattern is taught early and holds to the final image. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the “Convergence of Amber” label in the last paragraph flirts with thematic echo, keeping it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the dead-language phrase sinks, sealing the submerged concord with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bird-calls → seed release → phosphorescent garden, each image tightening the pattern. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; causality is lyric, not mechanical, and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cylinder→prism→leaf causal chain is tight, each groove-color beat widening history and narrowing Rook’s next move. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 4; moon-groove decoding rule is taught early and paid off when scarlet band reveals the chest site. Closure (Earned Stasis) is on-page: resealing the leaf costs him the comfort of forgetting; the settlement’s sigh confirms the reconfiguration. Persistent constraint—the leaf’s hum now inside him—shapes future guardianship, meeting the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is cleanly achieved via Charged Poise: the final overlay of charcoal lines crystallizes a “map of possibilities,” reweighting the deck’s empty vista into an invitation with undeniable felt cost—continued exile as pilgrim. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of stretched moments and returning sky-sketches builds density until the last image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift (“the last power flickered out” anchors who-when-where by line 3), and no causality breaks under the lyric repetitions. The piece meets the 9+ quick test for closure with cost, but the absence of a tightening beat that forecloses a live option keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s thaw reweights the world’s rule-set and the village children inherit wonder—cost is legible in the melting ice that can never be refrozen. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is swift; the sky-wrong cue anchors time. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final queen swap cracks the frost—sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers image and motif until the final pattern reweights meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; the gallery and interregnum are legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll’s exposure + penumbra’s curl make the cost of remembrance legible without overt sacrifice. However, the chessboard’s click-to-compartment mechanism is an unmotivated magical turn not seeded earlier; it slightly dilutes the accruing logic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each feather-touch thickens the sensory pattern until the single corridor-and-book intensification reweights “home” from fixed place to portable resonance. Closure is a clear Charged Poise: mountain inhales, Lira exhales, and both are changed. Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequential, but the pattern is taught early (“substitute reality nightly”) and pays off in the final breath-image. Cost is atmospheric yet legible—she gives up the stone’s addictive substitution for an earned internal cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolved labyrinth and re-hung "banner of peace" show visible cost—his exile status is unchanged but internally reframed. Causal chain holds: decoding threads → gate opens → altar confrontation → release. Orientation is swift; the tapestry-labyrinth link is taught by 25% mark. One minor elasticity: the "soft sigh" gate opening feels slightly convenient, but the prior tactile labor justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky-written “We are the echo” refracts into communal absolution, the price accepted. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern holds, but the forged-hush rule is taught only by repetition, not by early concrete cue, so the lens crystallizes late.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the sunrise-reflecting sea reweights the premise—story itself becomes the golden seam. Causality is lyric-accumulative, not because/therefore; the tightening is a cadence shift rather than an option-limiting choice. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. Cost is conceptual (her doubt sealed into story) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing shells on the easel reweight the premise, the cost is the secrecy itself—he will keep painting alone—so the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. The wrong-turn-into-oasis is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational allowance. Orientation is clean by line 3; no因果链断裂. The only drag is a mild “and-then” feel between cave nodes, but each node adds density, so escalation remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked cork catching dawn-light crystallizes the before/after of purified intent, cost felt in her synced heartbeat. Causal chain is light—garden scent as amplifier is asserted, not demonstrated—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “whisper” and “hum” densifies the stake until the final chord. Orientation is anchored by word 60: cobalt lighthouse, dawn, balcony, Mara. No lens ambiguity or off-stage resolution; the fisherman’s turn is coincidental yet complicating, not resolving, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the final Charged Poise when ships mirror constellations, reweighting the station from outward to inward beacon. The tightening is present—the lattice engine steadies the signal—but the decisive change is lyrical, not causal, and the cost is conceptual rather than felt by a body. Closure valid, but lack of navigator agency in the beat caps it below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal spine holds: because Mara cannot lie, she confesses the eye’s power → therefore the smugglers recoil → she seizes the moment to plant the eye as mirror. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the hanging orchard, storm, and eye are stably anchored. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “we learned that psychological safety grows…from the courage to reflect it together” reweights the premise with social cost. The eye’s mechanics (how reflection actually works) is elided, a minor softness but not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single continuous scene, Accumulative/Textural lens taught by ~word 40 (“gaps in the tide’s rhythm”) and held to final image. Closure is Charged Poise: the golden ribbons re-weight memory-oblivion stakes with undeniable cost—he accepts perpetual guardianship. Orientation anchored by word 30; no teleporting props; tide mechanics stay consistent. Cost is legible: “his heart lighter” yet path foreclosed to any life beyond the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence of creek-rising and ant-trails thickens texture until the corridor reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elian sees infinite paths—but the cost is conceptual, not felt; the “promise tightens like a rope” is the only on-page price and it’s abstract. Tightening is present but gentle; no option is foreclosed for Elian, only expanded.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a luminous CR—peace purchased by dream-dissolution—but causality between orb-burst and kingdom-wide relief is poetic leap, not earned linkage. Orientation is lush yet delayed; who/where stabilizes only after ~150 words. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift at orb-burst reweights stake, satisfying short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated brush dips and shell glow build density. Closure is a Charged Poise—dome of amber light reweights prior material. Cost is conceptual (they must guard the glow) but not felt on the page; no concrete forfeiture shown. Orientation clear by line 3; lens taught early and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the grave dissolves into “a marker for the stories I have yet to tell,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each return to the scroll thickens the texture of memory-envy until the closing lift outside. Orientation is swift and the dream-to-wake transition is cleanly signaled. Causality is minor (no irreversible external change), but the ending image cleanly pays off the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a gentle CR—sunrise lifts fog, the screw now “humming,” Lena re-pricing her scentless world—yet the cost is only asserted (“tremor of purpose”) rather than paid through a visible forfeiture or narrowed option. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog thins, water rises, light returns, all re-weighting the stake without causal reversals, but the absence of a tangible price keeps it shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each image layer (tea, quill, crystal, mist) reweights the stake until the final dissolution reconfigures meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—scars become legible stories—taught by pattern early and landed cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: orchard hush + perfume bridge crystallize options and felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—repetitions of scent, music, pages build until cadence shifts in the final “exhaled chord.” Orientation clean by line 3. One causal gap: why the perfume current now works after years is asserted not shown, but does not break closure. One meaningful tightening: apology sheet drifts down, reweighting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiraling clause adds density until the final image reweights the premise—history ends not with bang but hush. Orientation is taught by deliberately drifting anchors (“lost in time” named early), waiving penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seamless horizon revalues time itself, cost felt in her erasure. The only bar to 9.0 is a hairline lack of persistent constraint shaping earlier tactics; the spiral rule is declared, not tested against her until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the horizon dissolves into “pure, steady light” and the key’s cool touch reweights time as breath-interval, not number—cost is the lifelong vigilance he now accepts. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of backwards counting and gear-pulse thickens until the cadence flip at zero. Orientation is secure by line 6; no causal reversal, but density shift satisfies one-scene tightening rule.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pocketed button’s click reweights "revolution" from tech upgrade to quiet ethos, with a soft social cost—the farm’s guardians now share an unspoken vigilance. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the storm threat is external coincidence that tests the system but does not force a prior mistake to surface. Orientation is clear by word 60. Lens holds: pattern of light-as-guardian accrues density until the final re-pricing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: coin-click therefore stairwell therefore fluorescent map therefore ledger rewrite. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the new theorem reweights her life-rules with undeniable epistemic cost. Mid-text orientation drags slightly—library geography vs. subway level blur until the phosphorescent map teaches the rule—but the final image repairs the blur, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new caller layers the disc’s loop, tightening the pattern until the tunnel itself “breathes” the cadence—an effective Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and spatially steady. The only causal gap: Mara’s decision to leave the booth is unmotivated by any preceding pressure or forfeiture, so the closure carries conceptual but not felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: ledger closed, covenant renewed, sea-echo answers, cost felt in the chill metal pulse. Causality is light: the act of writing and locket placement is ritual, not reversible choice; lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence reweight meaning. Orientation is swift; no sequence breaks. One paraphrase loop mid-text keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: because Lira believes reciprocity can be engineered, she therefore answers the rumor, recruits misfits, and releases the fragment. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she decides the “cure” is the act of passing the lantern onward, a visible cost (loss of talisman) that reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by word 60; no teleporting props. The ivy-pattern puzzle is a micro-turn, not a second decisive change, so it doesn’t violate the single-DC rule.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira steps out of the stillpoint having forfeited detached observer status; the forest’s final sigh confirms the cost is felt. Accumulative lens holds—each ultrasonic note layers until the pure tone folds time. The “quiet blaze of inner light” image unmistakably reweights earlier motifs. No orientation debt; anchors clear at word 40. Minor deduction: stillpoint mechanics remain slightly abstract, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: final “listening” stance crystallizes options with conceptual cost—history edited yet identity preserved. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each pen-stroke adds texture rather than narrows external options. Orientation anchors early (lab, anomaly, desk) and holds. However, the tightening midpoint is a touch diffuse—no single beat where failure felt inevitable—so cost is more atmospheric than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Lira’s inherited ritual reweights the premise—silence is now portable music. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each empty click and signed gesture layers density until the moonlit harbor itself becomes a stave. Cost is legible in the final image—“the faint hum of waves that now sang in sign”—a conceptual repricing that makes absence audible. Causality remains intact; no orientation debt; only the slight ellipsis of Arlen’s exit keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural glows amber, sealing the archive with felt tenderness. Causal chain is clear—portrait→trail→phoenix tapestry→scroll—but the mentor’s promise arrives as a late parcel, not earned by prior tension; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a lyrical Earned Stasis: Lira keeps drumming, sorrow transmutes to quiet hope, and the garden’s pulse becomes the new protocol; the cost is the eternal vigil implied by “night after night.” Causality is soft-accumulative rather than tight because the institutional turn happens off-stage in a single clause, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each beat thickens the ambient texture until meaning reweights. Orientation is clear by line 30, well inside the 120-word guardrail. The ending’s conceptual price—perpetual caretaking of collective grief—is legible even though the bureaucratic pivot is reported, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the parchment’s line re-weights the premise with conceptual cost (“Whispers are the true currents”). Causality is accumulative/textural—each storm pulse thickens the map’s vein—so the lens holds. The key’s first appearance as a useless object that later opens the box is a satisfying, foreshadowed turn.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: imagery accretes around mirror-flashes and shutter-ripples, culminating in Charged Poise (night “aware of its own glitter”). Closure lands with conceptual cost (night re-weighted), but setup is late—orientation of scene, body, and rule-set drifts past 120 wds without clear anchor. Micro-turn is present but soft; no persistent constraint shapes later tactics. Causality remains atmospheric rather than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: repeating light-pattern, saplings, mist-density create a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the quiet has spoken”—with felt conceptual cost (town’s shared future). However, causality between grotto vibration and civic awakening is asserted, not demonstrated; the windows’ mechanics appear in summary after they’ve already succeeded, blurring the tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara returns to the same planks, yet the whale’s echo inside her reconfigures the harbor’s meaning from battleground to sanctuary. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sea-pull, bone-pulse, crystal-flare tightens until the last image reweights freedom as internal guardianship rather than escape. Orientation is anchored in first paragraph; no drift. Cost is legible in the cracked scrimshaw and the spirits spiraling away—her inheritance literally fractures to pay the price.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the baton and bouquet crystallize a new hush that reweights the mandate’s rules without breaking them. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shaving thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Cost is visible in the last image: “a silence that now seemed less imposed and more chosen.” No orientation debt; turbine shadows and kitchen anchor by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the amber lake and forward step reweight the boundary premise with conceptual cost visible in the final image. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of paraphrase→humming shift→veil lift threads through sensory cadence rather than causal chain. Orientation is lyrically delayed but coherent; no penalty applied. The cost is legible—“the world will remember”—but internal to poet, not reader-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard glass flowers sprout, reweighting imperfection as luminous. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each plant arrangement tightens Selene’s perceptual stake, but the reed’s rule-set is taught late and the phoenix clock stays ornamental, so the cost is conceptually visible yet not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each chime thickens the golden-shadow texture and deepens the mind’s response; the final “soft sigh” offers a Charged Poise that reconfigures kinship as mutual resonance. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks, though the closure cost is conceptual rather than corporeal. The pattern is taught early and held, earning its quiet reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each crane and thread layers density until the final balcony bloom reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the rose’s phosphorescence makes the “genuinely artificial” rule-set undeniable and re-prices the concept of mourning. Cost is felt: her prior “sparkle and purpose” remain foregone; the observatory now maps intention, not time. However, the vellum stencil itself never visibly constrains later tactics; its pattern is invoked but never materially complicates the final move, so the conceptual charge is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tape’s snap, the droplet-reflected “miniature universe,” and her stepping out reconfigure hope from ash (Charged Poise). Causality holds: each click of the tape leads to the next mapping beat; the hum at the corridor intersection is the because/therefore trigger. The lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds; cost is felt in the droplet image. Minor loop: “rain-beaded skylight” repeats four times without new charge, a −0.2 artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.0)
    The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the prism reweights the premise by releasing “atoms of nostalgia” into the world. Yet the causal chain is weak—random footfalls are declared to open the pagoda without intermediate failure or price—so the lens feels Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the legible lens ambiguity at closure keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a gentle Conceptual Repricing—the stone now “hums with captured shadows”—but the cost is purely atmospheric; nothing is relinquished or foreclosed. Causal chain is loose: watching footage → aligning stone → stone glows; the footage itself never resists or complicates, so the turn feels ornamental. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening is only a brightness shift, not an option-limiting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each layer of debris absorbed by the mist reweights trust. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—tail-tip reattached, colors re-harmonized—yet the cost is more atmospheric than visceral; the “scars will remain” line states rather than shows the price. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored by word 60), transitions are smooth, and the single deepening beat satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sunrise through cleared glass reweights time itself as readable scar tissue, felt cost rendered in molten light. Causal chain holds—hourglass + coffee-ring alignment literally clears the frost—yet the miracle remains lyrically displaced, satisfying Accumulative/Textural logic. Orientation lands by 120 w (tower, dawn, anesthesia fade) without debt. One tight shard plus attic loop satisfies scope; no prop teleport. Lens stays lyric-accumulative; final image crystallizes options without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new image deepens the same emotional density rather than causing events. Closure is a lyrical Charged Poise—the river of light and audience of shadows—whose cost is conceptually legible (“unused love cascade”) even if not corporeally felt. However, no meaningful tightening or option foreclosure occurs; the story widens into transcendence rather than narrowing under pressure. Because the ending reconfigures meaning without a before/after choice, it satisfies RR but not DC, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the archway now permanently emits verses, the dreamer walks away lighter, cost felt in fatigue and relinquished tool. Causal linkage holds—each traced star → unlocked chamber → instrument brightens → final release. Accumulative/texture lens dominates: repetition of “trace–record–echo” layers density until the last star tips the pattern. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Minor slip: “freedom” named rather than shown, but image of dimming aurora immediately repays, keeping 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reversed ticking clock releases visible waves that reconfigure the ruined world, and the cost—his lifelong dreamlessness now confronted by warmth—radiates through the final image of light-formed trees. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/thereor, but the pattern is taught early and holds to the luminous final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory stratum layers density until the final amber exhale re-prices the premise with conceptual cost (internal wilderness reclaimed). Pattern is taught early (“hum of insight” = metronome), transitions are liquid, and closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern-carrying image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ticket punch clicks open the chest, re-weighting earlier motifs into a visible conceptual re-pricing—“courage, unused, lay dormant.” Accumulative/textural lens holds: each indirect curl of the ferry deposits another image-layer until the final sunrise reconfigures the stakes. Causality is lyric rather than tight—why the cave opens now, or why Mira alone may enter, is quietly finessed—but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Cost is felt in the “weight of trust” line; absence of a sharper external price keeps the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the copper shimmer re-weights silence from menace to covenant. Accumulative lens holds: bolt → discoloration → copper glow re-codes safety as acquiescence. Cost is legible in the final image (“willingness to bear silence”). Orientation (who/where/when) is tacit but inferable by 120 words; no penalty. Causality is lyric rather than event-driven, appropriate to chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: pellet→map→alcove→crown→sunder, each because/therefore step tightening options. Orientation anchored by line 6; no debt. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: sky restarts, crown pocketed, temple sings—cost visible in collapse. Slight over-reliance on atmospheric summary between beats keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the console coordinate crystallizes a new navigable path, reweighting the atlas tear from loss to compass. Causal chain holds: tapping → resonance → canyon match → sea-level confirmation. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (reclaimed pier, dawn, fossil-fuel ban). One minor causal fuzz: how a watermark on paper maps to submerged canyon is asserted not demonstrated, but the lyrical lens absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bay’s engines roar back, workers emerge, and the stone’s hum reconfigures the lull into living pulse—visible conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern is taught early via the glyph-stone resonance and cadence of “hum” refrains. Orientation clear by ~70 words; no teleporting props. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: the reignition happens *to* her and the rebels, not *through* a decision that forecloses a path, so the tightening is felt as vibe-shift rather than option-shift.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain: kite discovery → glyph decoding → unseal → embryo awakening is linear and legible; transitions are smooth. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no debt. Escalation relies on one turn—amber cracks, destiny binds—cost is declared (lost lullabies) but not rendered on-page, so resonance is conceptual rather than felt. Lens holds as Situational/Accumulative; closure lands, but the missing dramatized cost caps Q2 at 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final step toward the cliff reconfigures options with felt cost—she chooses to plant hope while still carrying the photo’s wound. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (wind, salt, plant life) intensifies and cadence pivots on “shared pause.” Orientation is clear by line 6; no causality breaks. A single tightening suffices for this length, but the cost is present and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each new card/layer thickens the lighthouse’s breath until the spiral and descent force stance crystallization. Closure is a Charged Poise—phoenix card lifted in darkness—reweighting prior fragments with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint: door sealed, daylight forfeited. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no ambiguity at close.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ink patterns thicken until they reweight perception. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spiral’s fade makes the universe’s pause undeniable—so the unit lands. Yet the price (Kael’s outline dissolving) is asserted, not felt, because the story never anchors how concrete loss alters his next breath; causality stays lyrical rather than paid-for.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frozen shelf, trembling sigil, and distant citadel echo thickens the same stake—truth versus frozen silence—until the closing image of green shoots reweights the premise. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3); the single transition (letter → network → council) is legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letter on the podium revalues the library from tomb to lighthouse. Cost is legible (“scandal would echo…could never again be silenced”), though the final beat drifts into summary rather than a crystallized moment of Maren’s own cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of “quiet”/“tranquil blaze” thickens the pattern until the final lantern-glow reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—community vows crystallized in rose-petal distribution—charged by the weight of the anchored sandbag scrap; conceptual cost is the collective shouldering of memory. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3. Persistent constraint: the scrap’s ballast gravity literally steadies the fountain pulse and symbolically steadies futures. Cost is legible in the elder’s “weight of history settle like sand” and the boy’s inhalation that forecloses prior panic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence of sound-garden pulses reweights stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—spike skyward, echo accepted—but cost is conceptual, not felt; no persistent constraint forecloses future action. Orientation clear by 120 words; causality soft, leaning on resonance rather than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal spine holds: journalist’s call → Mira climbs → nib-actuated console → ledger located → hand-off; each step follows cleanly. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the ledger’s sudden appearance as an already-solved encryption inside the archives softens the decisive change; the cost (risk to Mira or the paper empire) is implied, not dramatized. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing, yet the repricing is narrated rather than felt on the body or resources, so the lens stays Hybrid-Accumulative rather than fully Causal under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: density of sound motifs, amber, letters, and backward clocks reweights the stake—guilt’s resonance—until the final hush lands as Charged Poise. Closure beats are dramatized: insect hum washing walls, meteor hush settling, Lyra stepping out—felt cost is the eternal caretaking she accepts. Handwritten letters act as causal bridge; firmware untangles because she physically stitches amber to recorder, no off-stage sleight. Orientation clear by 50 words; no teleports or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hush reweights the grotto’s rule-set and Liora’s art with undeniable social cost (travelers “unlearn their noise”). Accumulative lens holds: pattern of sand/tile/hush intensifies until the lilac unease flips to pastel peace. Orientation is swift; spatial anchors breathe through condensation, echo, mist. Causality stays internal and lyric—escalation is density, not external opposition—satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mosaic pulse re-stitches the sky and renames the plaza, reconfiguring the city’s emotional economy with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric/accumulative rather than strict “because/therefore”; pattern is taught early (stone speaks, demands rename) and paid off in the final image. Orientation is secured in the first paragraph; no spatial or temporal drift. The only minor slack is that the exact price (what the radical forfeits) is felt collectively rather than personally, but the reweighting is legible and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the orchard’s synesthetic density reweights the ghost’s stale applause into living promise. Orientation is swift—twilight theater, backstage, cracked floorboard—within 60 words. Causality is soft: why the coin activates only under apple-scented song is asserted, not motivated; the orchard’s appearance is pure invitation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the apples fall in luminous chime, the timeline re-brightens, the ghost releases the echo—cost is felt in the audible hush that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each light-pulse layer adds density until the final “whisper of another mind” reweights the premise. Orientation clear by 70 words; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the studio’s “willowglass dream” crystallizes options—she will share the map, not hoard it—felt cost is the exposure of her once-private nervous system to peer review.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each droplet adds density until the amber pulse reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the caves “sang” and the leaf becomes beacon—cost is conceptual (she remains solitary, voice now externalized), but the price is abstract rather than viscerally felt. Orientation is swift; no causal reversals are required by design, yet the final reconfiguration lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final bridge of sand reweights the prophecy rule-set, making time-reversal a lived social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of button → echo match tightens meaningfully. One scaffold loop—“the truth unravels” repeated twice—blurs cadence, keeping it shy of 8.0 purity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: imagistic pattern of “silver hush,” snow codes, and pillbox compartments builds toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal dominoes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the map reveals courage as a state and the valley light “stitches together” memories; cost is conceptual (acceptance of internal brokenness) but felt on-page. Orientation is adequate within 120 words. No meaningful tightening mid-piece; escalation is lyric accumulation, not rising risk, satisfying this lens but keeping tension flat for readers expecting causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gutters fall silent, fog lifts, river mirrors moon—image reweights prior layered metaphor with visible serenity. Causality is accumulative/textural: ambient listening thickens until pattern breaks into silver light; no because/therefore turn, yet cadence shift suffices. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual—he accepts that honoring layers is the essence—but felt only faintly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern’s amber burn reweights the entire rule-set (“kindness itself becomes sun”). Cost is legible in Mara’s relinquishing possession and accepting indefinite stewardship. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun-pattern following → lantern glow → hive re-animation → final image, each layer tightening the texture of time-fracture without causal reversal. No orientation debt; “cracked dunes / beekeeping oasis” anchors by word 20.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous vine adds density until the harbor’s atmosphere is re-priced. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing—the glowing fire-escape ladder rewrites what darkness means for the whole port, and the cost (“she would return each season,” exposed flesh to night air) is legible in the final exhale. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; only the rose-petal clock is late-appearing but it is decorative, not causal, so no penalty. One strand of scaffold—“quivering hush” thrice in two sentences—nicks perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sunrise-on-memory reframes isolation→independence via the sundial glow, cost felt as conceptual rather than causal. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light/hum/echo intensifies until meaning reweights; no causal chain required and none supplied. Orientation is established by word 40, no penalty. The piece teaches its lyric repetitions early and pays them off in the final image; transitions are legible under the mosaic shard rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensuous layer (rain, spiral, mosaic, constellations) thickens the texture until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Mira places the petal, the ceiling blooms with ink-stars, and the cost is the unrecoverable letters now sealed outside her control. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no causality break. One soft redundancy: “prismatic quiet” is repeated without intensification, but this is minor and does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers celestial/sonic imagery until the final shimmer reweights the premise. Anchors who/where/when arrive by line 3, satisfying orientation. The single closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the valley-wide subsonic hum—that makes conceptual cost legible (unity after division). Mild causality slippage: the dean’s emergency assembly is narrated as already resolved (“only to find the crowd already humming”), skipping the decisive beat that would show option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the key becomes “a compass point that could guide future explorers,” reweighting the entire spatial mutiny premise with social cost—stories vs. forgetting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each organ echo and wall rotation thickens texture until the final cadence reconfigures meaning. Causality holds: compass → organ note → passage opens → key retrieved → vow to share. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: each brushstroke and echo layers density until the quarry literally cracks open the names, a clean Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is swift, causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, and the closing image reweights the premise. Still, the lack of a visible cost to Mara—no brush dropped, no cut finger—keeps the closure from stinging.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nail immured in fresh concrete reweights the station’s moral compass with conceptual cost. Causal chain is thin—storm arrives because storm—but Mara’s choice to embed the nail is motivated and irreversible. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor teleport: the compass is first “beside” the nail, then absent from the sealing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glass photograph becomes a transferable “doorway” that reweights sin itself. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of flutter, pixel, echo—held to the final image. Cost is felt (“weight… like ash”), yet the causal chain from one song to universal amnesty is asserted, not constrained; the pixel rule is taught but not tested in failure, so the price feels illustrative rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because Arlen’s calm dissuades Maya, the algorithm reroutes; therefore the startup’s arc peaks and crashes, and he returns to the train. Closure lands in the pocketed euro + dawn walk—an Earned Stasis that reweights legacy with visible cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the crash is compressed into one sentence; a single concrete beat of server stall or investor flight would tighten causality to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: placing the telegram beside the crystal reweights “share the burden” from abstract plea to enacted contract with the sky. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; stars “answering” is poetic correlation, not engineered logic, but the pattern is internally consistent and taught early. Orientation is swift—plateau observatory, night, telegram by ~80 words. Closure beat carries felt conceptual cost: the temple opens, Mara’s solitude dissolves into communal covenant. Minor elasticity in causal linkage keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory scrap adds density until the silver clipping ignites a conceptual repricing. Closure is legible—portal opens, beacon ignites, scars heal—visible cost is the visionary’s binding to collective memory. Orientation is swift; the glade, dusk, and maze are anchored within 50 words. One minor causality waver: “the world had lately slipped…” is told, not shown, but it is not pivotal to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sigil and root-inlay thickens pattern until the amber conduit reweights the void. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the orchard’s sigh and Maelia’s lantern-thread crystallize options and cost without explanative gloss. Orientation is swift: catacomb orchard, skeletal trees, lone figure, burned card—all within first 60 words. Causality stays coherent under the lyrical pattern; every soot-line and luminescent spread is a visible “therefore” that accumulates toward the final breathing orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the ledger entry reweights “stage” from public lights to private conviction, cost felt in the amber dust settling. Drive lens is accumulative/textural; cadence tightens once through the compass→cloth→ledger pattern, deepening meaning without causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s sprout reweights her mission from hoarding to gifting, with the silver-particle snowfall as felt cost. Causal lattice holds—each glyph-pulse → magnetic alignment → seed germination → bridge to spirit—without loose joints. Orientation is clean by word 60; arbor location and floating chronology are anchored through motion and hum. One micro-turn (ladder becomes spiral) tightens the line of action under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the key melts into the creel, reweighting the premise that routine can hold wonder. The cost is conceptual but legible—the librarian accepts his own identity must migrate, a stasis that forecloses immutable selfhood. Causality is lyric-associative rather than tight because/therefore; the rupture of “tomorrow disappeared” is never clarified or paid off as a constraint that narrows options. Still, the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlit images tighten toward the final glowing creel, and the pattern is taught early enough to keep the drift coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each confession thickens the pool’s color and the pearl’s glow until a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) crowns the cave. Pattern is taught early—“confessions etched…glowed faintly”—and closure crystallizes options without exposition. Cost is present as communal sorrow absorbed, though the price to Mara personally is only implicitly shared warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ivy, rust, chalk, water) deepens the stake of self-forgiveness until the river’s reflection reweights the past. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the map I follow is drawn by my own hand”—with conceptual cost legible. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The library’s breathing shelves, cyclically-reversed glyphs, and propagation-delay cadence teach the pattern early; the map reconfigures at closure under the same logic. Orientation is secured by line 5 (“I clutched the confidence man’s watch”) and spatial anchors stay clean. The final garden image is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the living script of unspoken words becomes a pluckable petal, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No causal break; escalation is density/cadence driven, not conflict driven, and that is the taught mode.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the envoy lowers his sword, the city rises, the vines physically grow its foundation—cost is visible and irreversible. Causal lens holds: coffee-stain prophecy → vine dissent encoded in violin → envoy’s change of heart. One soft spot: the envoy’s interior shift is granted to him rather than forced by an overt action from Elara; a hairline slip but not a break. All else—object stakes, time pressure, metaphor pattern—tightens toward this final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald holds the last spark and is placed as beacon—cost is the aurora’s dimming, legible in the image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building in static → lattice → capture → placement, each beat adding density. Orientation clear by 80 words; no teleporting props. However, no causal tightening mid-scene; escalation is one gentle slope, not a meaningful narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sunrise light → scent → vine rustle creates cadence shift that reweights contentment from treasure to daily tending. Closure lands as Charged Poise—hairpin glowing, cycle acknowledged—cost is felt in her renunciation of revenge. Orientation clear by line 4; single transition (climb → grotto) is legible. No meaningful tightening after midpoint; escalation plateaus once the ritual completes, capping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind-chime pattern teaches early, cadence tightens through mirrored shard reprise, and closure lands via Charged Poise—“the cloak of doubt settle[s] around his shoulders” reweights certainty with visible cost; orientation is swift, causality is lyrical but traceable.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the stone→rings→magnetic hum pattern accretes meaning toward the grotto mirror. Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: Mira re-labels her curse as teachable art, with conceptual cost legible in the phrase “the art of appearing just as one chose to vanish.” However, the delayed-reveal mechanic is told rather than demonstrated in-scene; the causal chain is metaphoric, not consequential. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words, satisfying the test.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the instant she turns inward, the lattice of wind/bird/echo is reweighted to an internal compass, cost felt in the extinguishing arrowhead glow and vanished flock. The accumulative lens holds throughout—density of echo, dust, pulse—culminating in the crystallized stance. Orientation is taught early by the basalt niche and skeletal towers, waived penalty. Persistent constraint (motionless navigation) shapes every beat after midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone pulse scatters “fireflies that refused to be measured,” re-pricing the rule-set of mechanized creativity with visible conceptual cost. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (“lingering luminance”) and paid off in the final image. Orientation is anchored by ~70 words; no teleporting props or knowledge leaps occur. The mist-walk mechanics are soft-magic, yet they are seeded by the hermit and never solve a problem they didn’t help create.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative engine is Accumulative/Textural: each image (meteor hush, sea-glass cracks, page-light) layers chromatic density until the teal chord arrives as Conceptual Repricing—sound now visibly costs color. The key tag → lock → ribbon chain is taught early and pays off in final sigil; causality is lyrical, not mechanical, but coherent. The 120-word orientation anchor is cleanly met: “Eli, pier, lantern night” locked by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands on-page (“the promise…fulfilled…next journey”), and the persistent sigil foreshadows future price; cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coin flip reweights the entire rule-set—purpose becomes frequency, not goal—and the amber crack lets the void whisper back, undeniable cost. Causal chain holds: each static pop is a because/therefore step toward the final tone. One-shard structure is taught early and holds. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 40.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo shifts from burden to bridge, cost legible in the lifting halo and the remembered name. Accumulative lens holds—each naming beat densifies the stake—pattern taught by 25 % and paid off in final aurora. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is cleanly landed: the final bell-ring reconfigures both river and sky, paying an undeniable conceptual cost—the ghost of the last caught fish swimming upstream. Causal lens holds throughout: each droplet expands micro-fissures only when rhythm matches, so the bell’s restoration is a because/therefore chain, not coincidence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear inside the first 100 words and stay stable. No lens ambiguity; the last sentence crystallizes options without explanatory filler.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town’s shared silence reframes the reservoir from threat to mirror, cost felt in the collective breath. The photograph trail supplies causal linkage, each image tightening knowledge; only the midnight-to-sunrise sweep is compressed into lyric montage, not fully dramatized, keeping the lens Accumulative/Textural rather than Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the “quiet, everlasting sunrise” reweights the premise, sealing logic-intuition harmony with felt cost (she yields her scholarly detachment). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers sensory density—crystal thaw, amber hiss, fresco reveal—until the final spiral and shard-kiss crystallize the new stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 5 and never break; the orchard’s rules remain consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crystal explodes, forcing her to gather shards and complete the spiral—no reversals needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the revised harness becomes a tactile promise that forecloses retreat, cost visible in the metal bite. Causal chain holds—storm loss → climb → revise → static answer—tightened by the “hold fast” pulse. One soft spot: the radio phrase arrives as lucky grace, not earned reversal, slightly diluting agency. Orientation anchors by ~100 words; lens (Situational pressure → crystallized stance) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is clean: the slice frees the Duplicate, rewrites history, and charges Kael with felt twin pulse—visible cost under a Causal lens. Orientation anchors by line 4; transitions are smooth. One tightening beat suffices. No causality breaks, though the factions’ off-stage shouting is thin motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bloom reconfigures wonder for participants, but Mara’s personal stake remains static; no cost is felt by her on the page. Causal chain is thin: seed → riddles → airflow → bloom; orthogonal vents are a gimmick, not a constraint that shapes tactics. Orientation is fine; skylight & brook anchor early.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the leaf-blower blade stills, the house flickers awake, the conductor vanishes, leaving laughter as undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each blower-gust thickens sonic density until silence is re-priced as song. Orientation secure by line 3 (“hollow echo chamber tunnel”). No teleporting props; hourglass grain payoff lands exactly where tunnel exhales. The only micro-slip: “vanish” is slightly abstract, but the charged image of wind-backed laughter remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the guardian’s stance crystallizes—still waiting, but now inside a newly opened mist-wing of the library—cost legible in perpetual vigil and fused pendant. Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: each frosted petal, breath, pendant pulse accretes until the final cadence shift reweights uncertainty as companion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are signaled in first 120 words via “frozen garden,” “midnight,” “feral library guardian.” No causality breaks; pendant removal awakens breach is implicit threat, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: because the crozier is shattered, therefore he grinds ember-ash; because the first tincture whispers rather than ignites, therefore he adjusts concentration at the next penny-drop. Each “penny drops” beat tightens options and signals escalating cost; the final eruption of cold flame is a decisive change that reweights destiny from script to canvas. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (ember nexus at twilight) and remains stable; no prop teleporting or lore contradictions. Closure cost is legible in the paradoxical cold flame—he gains agency but must endure perpetual chill, a price that will shape future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the chord’s emergence is a pattern break that reweights the stake from salvage to communal rebirth. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Selin stands in dawn light having foreclosed personal claim on the shard; the tower’s awakening cables are the visible cost/constraint. Orientation is clear by line 3; causal linkage is lyric accumulation, not because/therefore, and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—images of mist, ribbons of time, phosphorescent threads—and holds it to the Charged Poise ending where the hourglass floats above the helm. Causality is lyric rather than strict: the radio tone “stitches” reality, sand rises instead of falls, passengers materialize; the logic is dream-pattern, not because/therefore. Orientation is waived because disorientation (clocks run sideways, ferry slips between worlds) is the taught pattern that pays off at closure. Cost is conceptual—the cosmos re-aligned—but legible in the final image of the floating hourglass, so closure qualifies.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bridge of golden rain reweights the premise—imagination is now measurable, the unreal has mass. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern intensification (color eruptions → filament rain) reconfigures meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early (“walls that bent perspective like liquid glass”) and anchors by word 50. Persistent constraint: the thread’s tension vibrates the air, a price that shapes every step across the bridge. Final image crystallizes options—he can now read the city as a canvas of shared filaments.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each paragraph layers another echo of light, lattice, and anchor until the final hush reweights the dominant stake—navigation as bridge between abyss and sky. Causality is loose but coherent; the test launch is the only decisive beat that materially alters options, and it lands cleanly with collective exhale as felt cost. The anchor link returns to the statue in a deliberate circular closure that reprices the symbol without needing exposition. However, the story never risks a tighter turning point for Mira herself, so the reconfiguration stays communal rather than personal, capping resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restored photo and synchronized hymn reconfigure meaning with felt cost. Causality is soft—scanner synchrony and light spill verge on magical—but pattern is taught early and held. Orientation clear by ~100 words; no lens contradiction. Cost is legible in final image; persistent constraint (promise to guard) shapes future path.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: Mara re-enters daylight having sealed the invisible map, cost paid by the burial of the codex itself—Conceptual Repricing with tangible forfeiture. Causal chain is thin (phase transition mechanics arrive late and work because the tide is high) but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: tide ⇄ cable hum ⇄ codex pulse pattern holds. Orientation is cleanly anchored inside the vestibule by line 3; no debt applied. One meaningful tightening only, but it reweights stakes acceptably for 740-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly with resonant reconfiguration: the shard warm in her coat, heartbeat synchronized, aurora above—felt cost is legible. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; ink-patterns and shard resonance tighten rather than twist plot. Orientation is anchored by word 80. The bureaucratic error revelation is delivered by ghost-whisper, not probed by Mara’s agency, so the decisive change is more receipt than earned turn, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final note seeds the wind, the birds re-weave, and the tunnel forever stores the new tongue—conceptual cost is undeniable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence layers (echoes, fracture-glow, wing-pulses) tighten until meaning is re-inscribed in stone. Orientation is crystalline: “mouth of a tunnel of echoes” anchors who/where in line 1; time = perpetual dusk. No causal break; the diamond’s crack and the birds’ spirals are earned pattern, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: static laughter layers until the moss silver-shift charges the final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the garden seals, the pocket feels absence—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric rather than tight; arrowhead gravity and phone confession feel associative, not sequential, yet pattern is taught early and paid off. Orientation crystal-clear by word 50; no teleporting props; one scaffold loop (“gravitationally playful echo”) lightly dulls final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the orchard’s breath and amber-coated gears reconfigure the world with undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each pulse-driven note thickens texture until the regime’s metal softens—though the middle repeats “resonantly soft” beats without tightening options further.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: bottle → flash → retreat → truce envelope → shared ascent. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crossed drone paths reconfigure the border with felt conceptual cost—“even a storm confined can still rain hope.” The lens stays causal throughout; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern choir re-stitches the train’s silence into a traveling symphony, undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “misting hush” and “whispering gleam” thickens the ambient stakes until the final ribbon-of-light image. Orientation anchored by line 3 (abandoned circus train, rusted rails). No因果 breaks; every gear-turn and mirror-glitter is earned by prior sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star-into-lake projection reweights the library’s quiet geometry and the scarf keeps humming, so the cost (continual vigilance) is legible. Causality is soft—hyperbolic algorithm is asserted, not tested—but the accumulative pattern (ripple → projection → ledger) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: the filament dissolves into jasmine scent, reweighting the pearl cipher from personal loss to communal hope. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern teaches sunrise→palette→photo→bridging light; final image crystallizes the pattern without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by line 40. The cost (Mara’s solitary nights) is back-loaded in exposition, not dramatized during the final beat, so emotional price is felt but not visible in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed filament reweights fear/courage for travelers yet to come. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each starlit image thickens texture until the filament’s release reframes the rule-set. Orientation is deliberate dream-logic; waiver applies because disorientation pays off in the final reconfiguration. Cost is cosmic, not character-bound—still legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard re-emerges, songs echo, greenhouse stands “testament,” cost felt in communal nostalgia rather than private loss. Causal chain is lyric-associative (mushroom–constellation–sextant–orchard) rather than because/therefore; pattern holds under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 5, no penalty. One meaningful tightening—water recedes as caps lock—suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolved shadow heals the walls, reversing exile with visible conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tea-leaf annotation adds density until the cadence shift at noon fractures the glass—no因果 breaks, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sunrise/twilight image layers density until the final dispersal of luminous spores reweights the orchard’s reality. Closure lands as Charged Poise—traveler leaves with sprig, orchard keeps humming—cost is conceptual (shared wonder) rather than personal, but legible. The piece teaches its pattern early and sustains it; causality is loose but coherent under lyric escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final winding of the single thread into the mask reweights the premise—grief is not erased but re-housed—and the starlight dimming supplies visible cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, each knot-release thickening the ambient hush; orientation is swift and spatial logic remains clean; causality is internal and ritual, not external plot, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the projected overlay reweights the tear from flaw to portal, charging the final image with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain holds—curiosity → footage alignment → glyph revelation → chapel re-opening—each step narrowing options under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rain-scoured fresco vault”) and the pattern of rainfall as clock keeps time legible. One minor causality bump: the projector repositioning is narrated as sure success rather than tested, but it occurs before the final image so the cost remains felt.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative pattern is taught early: every loop of wire mirrors a loop of memory; each filament snap prunes the maze. Closure lands cleanly—wax seals the cylinder and the globe shatters—delivering a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is swift, causality is lyrical but intact, and the final image reweights the premise. Minor deduction for the late-arriving “equation” that spells the concept rather than letting the image reprice it.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard wall becomes a living mural, the ghost folded into permanent graffiti, the balladeer’s voice now stitched to sky. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each lightning-thunder interval thickens pattern density until the final shared heartbeat. One hairline slip: the “later travelers” paragraph is a soft post-coda that slightly dilutes the on-page cost moment.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each floor adds luminous density until the goggles unlock the diary, then the descent re-weights the same light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he restores the goggles and seals the diary, leaving the joy circulating. Cost is legible: he relinquishes exclusive possession of the laughter, accepting perpetual service. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each cloud entry thickens the emotional lattice until the comet reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—telescope lowered into cradle, “spooled wholeness” reconfigured with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no drift. Single soft causality: string-break is past, present action is memorial, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each layer of pigment and each coin-guided notch thickens density until the ceiling becomes a living sky. The demolition deadline supplies a single coherent pressure that narrows to the final indent; no off-stage rescue. Closure is a Charged Poise: the mural shimmers exactly as stone falls, reconfiguring value—art survives as perceptual event, not physical object. Cost is legible in the last breath before dust, making the because/therefore linkage (“she chose to finish rather than flee”) undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the deck halo crystallizes a new resource with undeniable conceptual cost—the ship now glows with borrowed sky-light, life-force implicitly taxed. Causality is accumulative/textural: each phrasebook scrap + hopscotch square adds density until the cadence shift (silver vines wrapping copper) reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 60; lens holds. Minor slack: the “life-force” price is named but not dramatized in a beat of fatigue or flickering lamp, so the cost is felt more than visible—still legible under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is clean: the gear-circle clicks, the mirrored corridor reconfigures into sunrise, and the locksmith exits with the clock’s pulse now steadied—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored pane adds density until the final amber melt reweights the stake. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 50 words). One minor causality fuzz: the “filament of light” behaves like a sentient key without prior rule-teaching, but it does not rupture the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: communal bell-ringing under the brightening nebula crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope is now shared infrastructure. Causal chain holds: chalk call → gathered tools → water → bell tone → light surge, each because/there therefore. Cost is communal labor and the implicit promise to keep sharing; felt in the final breath of vapor. Orientation is anchored within 30 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pane thickens to a veil, time bows, and the lullaby migrates into sea-marrow—an undeniable conceptual repricing. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore; the pattern is taught early through nested echoes and paid off in the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“lighthouse at dusk”) and never drifts. The only cost hiccup: the sailor backstory is told, not dramatized, but it primed her childhood mission andtilts present choice, satisfying BRR exception.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of reed-impressions → nut → root-light accretes rather than causal chains. Closure lands with conceptual cost (orchard still cursed, caretaker exits), satisfying CR. One micro-turn—frost retreat at stump—tightens stakes; orientation anchors by line 3. No causality break, though lens shift to causal at frost-moment is momentarily ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty chrysalis becomes a glowing bridge, reweighting failure into future repair. The foam-lattice insight is causally anchored and paid for by her leaving the lab, kneeling in cold water, risking another failure. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each foam pop adds density until the cadence shift in the final line. Cost is legible: the bridge’s glow is both triumph and perpetual reminder of the first hollow shell.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured silence literally brightens the bottle, a tangible metric of absence becoming light. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—moonlight threads now stitch every unwritten book, reweighting “origin” from place to quantified void; cost is the irreversible dispersal of the vendor’s sole power. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 4; no penalty. One soft edge: the child’s arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed under Situational logic.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: tidal-pool pattern mirrors memory ebb/flow, pressure deepens through imagistic repetition rather than causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise: coral cracks sigh, remorse-carrying chill flips to “sweet promise of memory,” cost felt as atmospheric release. Orientation anchor (“who/where/when”) is cleanly delivered inside first 60 words. No meaningful tightening—no option is foreclosed—so escalation stays imagistic rather than tactical; cost is tonal, not tactical, keeping score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chanted language layer thickens the sonic pattern until the final cadence reweights the stakes from isolation to communal song. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tower’s dawn chime crystallizes options (bridges exist, silos now sing) with undeniable conceptual cost: she has spent her archive of voices in one night. Causality is lyric, not mechanical, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the last line. Orientation is anchored by word 40 ("old city... astronomical clock tower"); no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence-shift and image-density reweight the stake rather than causal chains. Orientation is swift—“moonlit canyon” by line 2—so no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fading tableau reconfigures meaning with felt cost (dreams will vanish again). The “synaptic plasticity” rule is lyric metaphor, not taught mechanics, so the bridge holds only poetically, not causally—acceptable under this lens but limits upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seedlings become living lamps, a visible re-weighting of the library’s future. Causality holds—doodle → grotto → glyph → seedlings—yet the hour of inverted gravity is announced, not earned, and the threshold mechanics remain hand-waved “according to the chronicle.” The cost is institutionally ornamental (new décor) rather than personally levied on Liora, softening the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is lyric-resonant (porcelain hum turns grove audible) but causal chain is loose: “each new note forced him to study a different crack” is repeated summary, not escalating beat. Hedgehog/owls arrive as coincidence, not consequence/therefore. Cost is airy (“release,” “promise”) rather than tangible or foreclosed. World-rule never tests whether porcelain might fracture under feeling, leaving the conceptual repricing attractive but not irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sky-pattern echo tightens the thematic coil rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift; the eclipse covenant’s paused-conversation reconfiguration lands with felt cost—he forfeits the certainty of brokenness. Closure is clean, lyrical, and reweights prior motifs without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing diary and collective exhale reweight silence into shared listening; cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative lens holds: crystal plates, heartbeat tuning, and fireworks cadence tighten texture toward final resonance. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. One soft spot: the “locked diary clasp” emits glow before any visible failure or price, blunting the causal hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patience + ritual = bloom. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words and hold. Closure is a Charged Poise: the black spathe releases its perfume and the village breathes the new calm—conceptual cost legible as “serenity within motion.” No meaningful tightening or option-foreclosure occurs mid-line; the escalation is steady observation rather than narrowing pressure, so the beat feels more tableau than turn.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the dissolved tip drifting into soil re-prices the planet’s rule-set and Mira’s role. Causal linkage holds throughout: inversion hour → probe → find → test → release. The final image carries undeniable conceptual cost—she can now “hear and guide” but no longer possesses the catalyst. One micro-turn (gravity normalizes) tightens options without breaking lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the “ghostly vortex” folds, the port exhales, and Mara pockets the patch—an Earned Stasis image that forecloses further intervention. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each wind reading tightens the textual pattern until the final sigh; the lens is stable. Cost is conceptual—the town’s next breath is now “measured, understood, and guided” by her invisible map—visible in the revived breeze. Minor waiver: orientation anchors arrive after 120 words, but the delay is functional (taught disorientation that pays off in the maze-like reveal), so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the cavern holds an enriched silence, the aurora-linked paper pulses, and the continuum of future listeners is made legible—conceptual cost felt in the image “a heart beating in sync with the aurora.” Causality is Accumulativ/Textural: each sensory layer deepens the same stake rather than forcing new turns, and the pattern is taught early enough to keep orientation secure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: driftwood→flute→seam→flute-silence forms a tightening pattern that reweights the stake (guardianship must embrace failure). Closure is a Charged Poise: the inverted flute’s silence reconfigures meaning and carries undeniable conceptual cost—she forfeits loud triumph for quiet seeding. Causality intact; each marker and note is a choice that narrows options toward the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked halo sprays the room with “colors of all the personalities,” a visible reweighting of her theorem. Causality is thin—why the fragment cracks now is unmotivated—but the image retroactively charges prior printing acts. Orientation is swift; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mosaic chain of encounters is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens and lands a soft CR: the ridge becomes a myth-pipeline. Weakness: no persistent constraint or price paid by the courier; the mentor echo acts as free wisdom rather than a limit, so closure feels more glow than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain (prism → frost → grief → engine → road) is lucid and each link tightens the previous. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s new glow is an undeniable social cost—the world must now feel what objects hid. Orientation is nailed in line 2; no caps triggered. The “truthful lie” refrain could have been reprised in the final sentence to seal lens consistency at 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each puzzle-click and light-filament adds density rather than causal turn. Closure is a Charged Poise—the silver thread’s arrival reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (her spent glow). Orientation anchors arrive late (~130 w) but serve the dream-logic, so waiver applies. No meaningful escalation under this lens is required; the deepening pattern suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal chain holds: failed memory → tunnel opens → silk taken → blade rebuilds land. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the blade’s azure note re-weights the planet’s heart and the crowd’s stance. Cost is visible—the forge wrapped in the now-spent silk, his scar humming—but the lens tilts lyrical/accumulative rather than tight causal, so the final beat feels luminous more than irrevocable. A sharper physical drawback—burned fingerprints, cracked anvil—would have deepened the because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the shard fractures, realities merge, crew awakens, truth is released—felt cost is the shard’s loss and Lira’s acceptance of a changed universe. Causal linkage holds: shard redirect ➔ slit opens ➔ parallel bay found ➔ log revealed ➔ cycle broken. Minor waver: the log’s catastrophic-engine-failure reveal is delivered in one summarized sentence; still, the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral hums, the glass is pocketed, and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural—density of image reweights the stake from “restore lamp” to “carry bottled safety.” Cost is conceptual (he accepts darkness) but felt only faintly; the causal chain is impressionistic, not tightened. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sunrise will be “reborn in shadowed brilliance,” a legible before/after shift. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photon-bend adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Yet the newspaper trigger is a late graft (appears ~ word 500) and the prism’s rule set is never taught early; the reader must retrofit logic. Orientation is clear by line 40, satisfying the 120-word anchor, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece accretes images until the loom reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s promise crystallizes options and stakes, but the cost (the burden of guarding iridescence) is only asserted, not dramatized. Orientation is taught by line 3 and holds; no temporal or spatial confusion. The weakness: no tightening turn between middle and ending; revelation is delivered by scroll rather than by a decision forced under pressure, so escalation is scenic, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the last filament drifts upward, sorrow becomes “measurable peace,” and the tower inhales—an undeniable reweighting of the premise with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each dream-thread Eli traces incrementally dims the grid until the cadence shift arrives. Causality is intact—moonlight + sextant → filament release → tower exhalation. The squeeze under 9.0 is the late arrival of the true mechanic (dream-mapping) at ~70 %; pattern is legible but taught only then.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a lyric Charged Poise: the night softens and the orchard “breathes,” reweighting the realm’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost (perpetual sunrise). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each song layer thickens density until a cadence-shift releases the kingdom into color. Orientation is clear early; causality is loose but permissible under the lyric mosaic design. The price is felt, yet the final beat is slightly diffuse because the “bound release” is sung rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path for Lira herself.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank mirror-book reframes his exile as portable sanctuary. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because each beat is an atmospheric echo rather than a therefore link. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the single shard satisfies scope. The persistent cost—he must carry silence into noise—holds; the library dissolves but the insight remains on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer deepens the same stake—recovering sacrality from ruins—until the final bread-sharing crystallizes an earned hush; the closure is a Charged Poise that reweights ordinary crumbs into relics, with felt cost (the loaf consumed, the night indifferent) legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering lantern constellation reconfigures the silence into a map she can now carry out. Causality holds—each frequency shift tightens the possible temperature until only one pulse remains, forging the corridor of meaning. The Orientation Test is satisfied within the first 80 words via ice-pillar anchoring. Cost is legible in the final ledger-hum that now “resonates louder than any storm,” a persistent constraint she must physically bear away.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: because Lila decodes Marrow’s false-start habit, she can plant the decoy vial, therefore collapsing the rival raid and preserving the tunnel lights. Closure is a Charged Poise—watch fob ticking atop the elders’ table while dawn extinguishes every lantern—reconfiguring stakes: perpetual distrust now the only “peace.” Persistent constraint (sunset deadline) shapes every tactic; the final image makes the cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of aurora, lavender, and spore vapors thickens until the compass lines glow, reweighting the stake from “curiosity” to “kinship.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the sweet metallic note crystallizes options—but the cost is ecological, not character-specific. Orientation anchors appear late (~150 words) yet serve the final image, so waiver applies. Causality is pattern-based, not because/therefore; acceptable under Accumulative rules.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lock clicks, ink floods her veins, and the cave’s sorrow flips to creative charge—before/after is legible. Causality holds: mirror-reflection → shards align → vial released; each step is tethered to prior setup. The broken lock’s “fractured rainbows” prefigure the final aurora, satisfying pattern-payoff. Cost is felt: she now bears the cave’s weight in warm fingers—no reset, no soft exit.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final whispered truth reconfigures both sky and social fabric, cost paid in the same sentence the vent surges. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each re-reading adds density until the cadence shift of the healed sky—and the pattern is taught early via the fragment’s color changes. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“After the oasis dried…”) well inside the 120-word window. Only a hairline slip keeps this from 9+: the conduit-to-sky beat is a single leap, not strictly prepared, so the causality is slightly lucky rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers returning images—iceberg gleam, copper shadow, seasonal silence—until the final glint reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the last heartbeat of motion promises future dawns, so cost is conceptual (endless vigil) not dramatized. No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 3. The pattern is taught early and holds, but the tightening is tonal repetition rather than a single decisive intensification, so escalation feels diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is legible: magnetic shift → shield flicker → burn threat → Vira miniaturizes chaos → controlled burn → static dissolved. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the box, once repository of fear, becomes a “seed of calm” visibly rooted under the vine. Cost is felt in the final image—Vira’s static is gone, but the box is now literally planted, foreclosing her ability to open it again. One minor loop: “the farm thrummed with a quiet, renewed energy” restates the prior sentence’s beat without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—postcards, letters, whispers layering into a choral cadence—and closure lands as Charged Poise: the bench becomes a communal ear, cost felt in the hush that replaces traffic noise. Causality is lyric rather than tight “because/therefore,” but the pattern is coherent; the final image reweights the premise without explanatory glide. Orientation is clean within 120 words and anchors hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal sealed in kelp-journal reweights vulnerability as portable strength, tide recedes, lab rises—visible before/after. Causal lens is thin—why dice open now is danced, not motivated—yet Accumulative/Textural pattern (each journal line = breath) holds across lyric shards. Orientation anchor arrives by line 3 (“sunken laboratory”) so no penalty. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits secrecy of the lab itself; felt price is oblique but legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: spiral pattern taught in coffee ground → salt wall → wildflower key. Closure is a Charged Poise—lantern now carries whale-song and deleted memories with felt conceptual cost (“weight of each reclaimed fragment”). Causality stays intact; no teleporting props; orientation anchors within 120 words. Persistent constraint—the lantern’s new cargo—shapes any future night she lights the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the sky-rupture is averted via an Earned Stasis—the summoner seals the code inside the wing and accepts perpetual guardianship. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each pulse of hush layers density until the lattice crystallizes; coincidence never intrudes. Cost is visible—the brook stills, fireflies dim, dawn bleeds—signaling the world now runs on her quiet debt. Orientation is swift; lantern, brook, night are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the antique seal and the borrowed-sugar ritual crystallize a new pact whose cost is the indefinite deferral of scholarly proof. Causality is accumulative/textural—images layer (meteor, seal, tea) until the rooftop air turns conspiratorial; the lens is coherent. Orientation is swift: meteor shower, rosemary bush, and illicit tutor are anchored by line 3. One soft spot: the “forgotten sugar” beat is a micro-turn, not a tightening that forecloses an option, so escalation stays gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure reaches for Charged Poise—shell and sunrise merge, solitude reframed as lighthouse—but the cost is only asserted, not shown (“tragically radiant reminder”). Causality is lyric-accumulative: each dusk listen adds a fragment, but the final sunrise does not tighten or foreclose; it merely decorates the prior accumulation. Orientation is clear by line 3; no penalty. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending image lacks a visible price or constraint that reshapes future action, so the reconfiguration feels conceptual, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the key dissolves, the thorn glows, the drip cadence reconfigures memory into living echo—cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral of ink and drip adds density until the final haze reframes the past. Orientation is swift; space-time anchored by aurora and drip within 50 words. No meaningful tightening inside the scene—pressure is steady-state rather than escalatory—so stays short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each echo-layer thickens texture until the final conjoining reweights “untold stories” as the conceptual cost. Orientation is never in doubt; the serpentine path is spatially tracked. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lattice void reconfigures meaning without a physical sacrifice on her part.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the vapor window bridging shrine and dreamscape reweights the meaning of “pure thing” with social cost visible in the strangers’ bright eyes. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dream-cameo density → lattice recognition → vapor bridge. The melted globe’s amber pulse supplies the felt cost on the page. Orientation is anchored by lantern, cliff, shrine within 120 words; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the whisk-steam “reveals” hidden patterns and the promise to return, reweighting the world as stitched by unseen hands. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift substitute for causal turns—and it holds. Orientation is secure by word 60; moon-path, parapet, fireflies anchor who-where-when. Cost is conceptual (lifelong return to invisible mending) rather than visceral; still, the image is legible and final.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the moment radiation thickens then dissolves under the diamond, the orchard trees shimmer, and Mira whispers gratitude—cost is felt as irreversible guardianship, not exposition. Causal chain holds: each shredded fragment leads to map, map to tree, cradle to stillpoint; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sun hung low over the wasteland orchard”) and never drifts. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dust/radiation accumulation breaks into sudden stillness—taught early and paid off at final image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sunrise paints the clouds and the vales swear allegiance—but the cost is borne by unnamed crowds, not the protagonist who merely watches. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each mirrored/refracted image thickens texture rather than narrowing options. The lens holds, yet the decisive constraint (the copper coils’ power) is introduced late and never endangers the hero, blunting the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each jar accumulates sonic memory, tightening the stake in heritage until the closing transfer reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the loft becomes a “chapel of resonance” and the poet’s solitude converts to shared hymn with the child. Spatial/temporal anchors arrive by line 3; no orientation penalty. One causality wobble: the dunes “whisper” the mission—externalized impetus that slightly dilutes internal momentum, but the pattern sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the vault opens, the artifact is secured, and the lighthouse beam crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt custodial cost. Causal links hold (432 Hz × amplitude → lock sings), but the middle contains mild telescoping: three beats of “set-up drum → strike once → success” compress tension rather than tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moon-arc imagery layers until the cadence shift at apex moon hum. The closure is a Charged Poise—final silver line plus released tether—felt cost legible without exposition. Orientation anchored by word 40, transitions clean within the single shard. One causality micro-gap: the “rain” that magnetized the viaduct is never grounded in present weather logic, but the mis-step is outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the valve turn redirects water and symbolically loosens bureaucratic neglect; droplets become “tiny stars” that reweight all prior seepage. Causal chain holds—each observation tightens until the lantern-lit valve crystallizes the twin stakes (lives saved, history honored). Cost is legible in the groaning pipe and the protagonist’s “fortified vulnerability.” Minor lag: orientation (who/where) is complete by ~140 words, safely within waiver; lens is Accumulative/Textural and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single, causally coherent scene: the heart is brought, diagnosed, opened, and revived through the chaplain’s literal twist of a brass rod. The “faint humming → shaft of sunlight → soft thump” sequence delivers a Decisive Change with felt cost—his promise now pulses inside metal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. The only slack is the late-shopkeeper contribution that could have tightened options earlier, a micro-softening of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.3)
    Closure is a charming image—the bell’s silent crack dispersing mist—but it reconfirms rather than reweights the premise; we feel no new constraint or forfeiture. Causality is lyrical-accumulative rather than tight: “because/therefore” is replaced by sprightly listing. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence thickens, yet options never narrow, so the ending lands as tableau, not turn.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: Lia’s second, deliberate lie transforms the archive from static repository into living beacon, a Conceptual Repricing that makes the crew’s “silence you felt as absence” newly legible as presence. Causal linkage holds—each 17-42-108 spike is traceable to her bait post that re-animates deleted bits. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“vaulted archives of the global social network”) and never loosens. Only nit: the checksum revelation is narrated rather than decoded in-scene, a micro-loss of immediacy at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the re-lit orchard reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—“anomalies become ordinary once shared.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror glimpse thickens the pattern until the golden aura reweights the stake. Causality is soft—why vintage mirrors reconstitute crystal is asserted, not motivated—but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final lullaby image reweights the premise from seeking death to accepting endings’ approach, with soft felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality remains associative; the lace tip’s moonlit scatter functions more as lyrical pattern than propulsive pivot, so the tightening is cadence-shift rather than option-narrowing. One scaffold loop (“the wind sang its solemn lullaby”) repeats across closing paragraphs, dulling final image precision. Orientation holds early; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of parallel-drawing teaches itself by 25 % and holds to quiet CR—“the vineyard pulsed with newly kindled understanding.” Orientation anchored by bus/leaf swirl within 50 words. No causality breaks; the burnt letter’s burial is the visible, irreversible act that reprices the premise: ashes can speak to roots. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the Keeper steps out to “consecrate each new clearing,” re-affirming rather than altering his vocation. Causality is loose—without a prior limitation or price, the clearing’s appearance feels like beneficent ritual rather than stakes-based escalation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the dunes record the resonance, but the reader never sees a before/after shift in options or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered photographs and lavender scent rather than causal chains. Orientation is clear by word 60, satisfying the 120-word gate. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the feather’s dust reweights the past—but the cost is societal, not personal; Mara pays nothing visible, so the reconfiguration feels philanthropic rather than earned. No persistent constraint or price shapes her future tactics, capping resonance at “nice moment” instead of irrevocable change.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the folded page reweights the premise—dictionaries end, but living testimony persists. The crystal’s pattern is taught early and repaid in the final image; cost is the scholar’s acceptance of unprintable knowledge. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“edge of the city… heavy doors”). One continuous scene, single POV, no causality breaks; escalation is textural density tightening rather than causal reversal, coherent with chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repetitive cadence of mist, tide, echo thickens until chalk line reweights aging itself. Closure lands as Charged Poise—chalk dust on slab makes the sound of growing older undeniable. Cost is legible: he forfeits the memory he tried to trap. Pattern taught early (“precognitively forgetful”) pays off in final dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.9)
    Closure is present: the hand surrenders excess spin to the telescope, granting thrust—a tidy Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole frame. Yet causality is lyric-associative, not because/therefore: the leaf-sound metronome appears ex nihilo and the gear-realign mechanics are hand-waved (“he knew… he must…”)*.* The reader is asked to admire rather than trace. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image lands, but the path feels like spell-casting, not engineering.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers image (vinyl shard, scent, cloud-haven) until the final chord reweights “brokenness” into wholeness—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; the blood-work clock anchors time, and the single-scene hospice room stays spatially coherent. No causal reversals are needed; the tightening comes via cadence slowdown and sensory density. Closure carries felt cost: the shard warmed by music, staff dividing the fragments—an irreversible after-change.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “map of shadow routes” reweights the premise and the key’s final winding signals a persistent constraint. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each traced loop tightens pattern until the translucent doorway pays it off. Orientation is anchored early by wind, copper plates, telescope; no disorientation serves the ending, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the single scene’s lyric repetitions (“shrewdly innocent” ×3, “cleft” ×3) build a cadence that peaks when the glowing tooth seeds the garden’s “embryonic galaxy.” Closure—Charged Poise—lands as Mara exits with the re-energized tooth; conceptual cost (she now carries a live fragment of the scholar’s erased life) is legible. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causal reversals, yet the density shift reweights belief. Minor scaffold loop keeps it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the server-into-lullaby shift is legible, warm, conceptually costly (viral memory → tender archive). Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each stone/proffer thickens texture until moss rewrites code—though the pendant-as-key is a gentle miracle rather than a motivated pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern—gathering ephemeral cameos against narrative current—tightens through cadence shift and density increase until final Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page: “the spiral seashell fragment glowed brighter, completing the arc,” reweighting prior hopes with undeniable conceptual cost. Anchors who/where/when implicit by word 60 (feral nexus, mist, novelist). No causality breaks; shell and mist constrain tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is legible: moon-rise → lyre → pollen → covenant renewed. Orientation is immediate (“edge of the ancient forest… pre-dawn”) and the single scene stays anchored. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the valley’s “heartbeat” rewoven—yet the cost is communal, not personal, weakening the felt stake for Mara. A lyrical, accumulative design is inferred; escalation is tonal density rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene, single-POV, accumulative design: each spiral placement adds density until the flare crystallizes a Charged Poise—starlight maps that will guide “wandering souls.” Cost is legible in the closing covenant of endless tending; the orchard’s future inhale reweights the prior stillness. Orientation is anchored within 30 words; no lens ambiguity. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off with the final snowfall image, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cellar of reason is redefined as a library, reweighting the premise with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds—density of reflected light/echo increases until the final pulse reconfigures meaning. One minor scaffold: “Thus the reflective locksmith…” is an explanatory bridge that could have been cut. Still, the ending image of starlight on the crystal timer crystallizes the before/after shift with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers motif on motif (shingled hush, whalebone reverie, bronze dust) toward a Charged Poise closure where the grotto exhales into lullaby. However, each beat is additive description rather than causal tightening; “calcify” and “orient properly” function as magic verbs rather than rule-based constraints. The promised cost is atmospheric, not legible on a choice or irreversible change—no path is foreclosed for the weaver, only transmuted into prettier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern crystallizes grief into usable light, cost felt in the softening of the absent roar. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (steam, sap, rust light) thickens the texture until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is internal but coherent: kettle steam → sap softens → glass seals → lantern glows; no teleport or plot amnesia. The tightening is singular yet sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lagoon stills, the ghost smiles, the camera wheel becomes a relic—cost is felt in the tense hush. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each collected story-stitch visibly thickens the ghost until the swap is inevitable. Orientation is taught late but pays off at the final image, so no penalty. The one transition (platform → horizon walk) is legible; no prop or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is legible: the terminal breathes again and faintly signals the towns, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the revived machine could be misused. Causal chain holds: sextant angle → power reroute → life-support surge → beacon. However, the Orientation Test applies: “echo of departing carnival lights still faint in the dust” leaves time/place ambiguous past 120 words and the effect does not sharpen the final image, so −0.3 is taken here, capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (petrichor, crystal breath, robin muffled song) thickens until the pattern break—the single chime—reweights memory itself as measurable time. Closure is a Charged Poise: the clock stands, cost is the lifelong loneliness he now chooses to keep. Causality is lyric rather than plot-sequential, but the final image crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the sunrise bends time, the city’s lying spires are re-measured, and the seeker’s resolve to keep salvaging stories carries undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—sundial shadows → lock turns → water surge → cathedral of lies crumbles. The “architecture of lies” is metaphorically bold but never defined on-page; because the payoff is imagistic rather than concrete, the lens hovers Accumulative/Textural rather than pure Causal. The final image reweights the premise, satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral constellation recognition reweights prior knots, fulfilling the Accumulative lens. However, the story exceeds 800 words (~860), violating the hard ceiling; the knot-to-constellation payoff is legible but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each vignette-layer deepens the dominant stake—“mapping the geography of healing”—until the final image reweights it. The rose’s revival is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the cost of endless narration undeniable. Causality holds without leaps; the thread’s return to the satchel forecloses rest, crystallizing Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the palace’s gears synchronize with living song, reweighting the rule-set. Causality is loose—lyric/accumulative lens—but the final image crystallizes a before/after. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The “flawed genesis” backstory is anchored to present action (salvaging shards) and tilts the cradle choice, satisfying BRR. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of migrating cloud/shadow, coin-song and sand-memory intensify toward dawn chord. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the coin’s hum reweights prior scars and migrates outward with clouds—felt, visible, no exposition. Orientation anchored by 50 words. Persistent constraint: red thread binds her to pier, literal/figurative cost legible. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of breadcrumb glyphs → geese pause → glass spill forms mirror-constellation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sky-new constellation re-weights memory from prison to shared sky, cost felt in the box’s now-empty weight. Orientation anchors by line 3; spatial logic holds. One minor causality wobble: “sidereal patience” is named before we see it tested, but the lyric contract is taught early enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the glowing soil re-weights light-from-math as love's viable transit, with ancestral cost implied by "every generation’s sigh." Accumulative lens holds: each sonar return deepens density rather than causal plot. Orientation clear by line 4; one soft transition inside garden; no meaningful tightening inside 800 words, so escalation is cadence-growth, not option-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ribbon + butterfly + poem accretes meaning until the basin stone “sings.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—the heart-shaped ribbon river reconfigures grief into shared artifact—cost is conceptual (grief made public/flowing) rather than personal to Eliam. Orientation is clear early; causality between spiral stones and ribbon length is loose but acceptable under lyric pattern. No decisive change or renunciation by protagonist keeps it below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: each inscription layers like barnacles until the final image of glowing constellations reweights meaning. However, the single meaningful tightening—the pendulum pause—repeats identically every sunrise; the pattern is taught early but never intensifies or forecloses an option, so closure feels circular rather than costly. Orientation holds: ridge, tower, Mara anchored within 50 words; no因果 breaks, yet the absence of a final price keeps the reconfiguration soft.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circle traced on the map reweights memory into seed, with felt cost in the dust-applause. Causality is lyric-associative (Accumulative/Textural lens); pattern taught early via tapestry threads. One hitch: the chess-clock image is dropped but never ticks or tightens options; it’s decorative, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the kingdom’s future is “already inscribed” because modeling rewrote reality, a cleanly legible before/after. Causal chain survives: lattice → crystal contraption → forecast → blueprint → harvest; each step is present on the page. Orientation is established by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual, not felt—no personal price for the cartographer—so the high-band 9+ gate stays locked.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the crowd’s applause crystallizes a new social contract—dust now speaks—while Mara tightens the shawl, signalling the price of perpetual vigilance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: every broadcast fragment thickens the atmospheric stakes until the final cadence reweights the city’s silence into story. Causality is intact—pirate signal → transcription → public playback—though the radio’s physics stays lightly magical. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ash, powder, shard, and rocking-chair creak thickens until the final crystalline lattice reweights the stake ("safety is only an illusion"). Orientation is swift: who (ash scatterer), where (vanishing-point gallery), when (just before dusk) all land inside 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the powder dissolves but the emotion is "forever etched in stone," a conceptual repricing with undeniable cost—she exits stripped of her mask and her ritual tool. One scaffold loop ("She whispered again…") is minor; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cog’s tick reweights the past’s “competing narratives” into a shared pulse, felt cost is the narrator’s acceptance of perpetual ambiguity. Causal linkage holds—cog discovery → sediment reading → cipher decision—under Accumulative lens; one meaningful tightening occurs when the cog syncs with strata, reconfiguring stakes. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no ambiguity at end. A single beat of escalation suffices; cost is legible in the final image. Minor slack: the phrase “rationally rebellious” is asserted twice without fresh causality, barely keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of vanishing songs → silence → tentative return, tightened by cadenced refrain of “subtracting noise.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing rosette reweights the premise that art can survive erasure; cost is felt—she keeps losing songs faster than she can save them. Orientation is clean within 120 w, one shard only. Causality is soft: the crowd’s conversion is lyrical accumulation, not consequence chain; therefore the ending resonates but does not foreclose a path with visible personal cost to her.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse pulses with memory-song and Mara’s stance crystallizes—she has seeded a new culture and forfeited the old. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (taste, scent, light) thickens until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Causality is lyric, not causal-turn, but the pattern is taught early (“the seed required a mind that could prune”) and paid off when vines literally shed dead weight. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure; cost is the irreversible release of city lullabies into leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s amber veins and the citizens’ lingering ceremony visually reweight the premise—routine itself becomes spectacle. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph adds a sensory layer (blackout silence → lacquer sheen → brass key → amber echo) that tightens the stake of recovering wonder. The “Echo” glyph is the single meaningful intensification; it is sufficient for this length but lands gently—no option is foreclosed, only re-seen. Cost is conceptual (the hive loss was necessary pause) and is legible in the final image of honeyed light; a hair stronger visceral price would nudge this to 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s pulse syncs to the hush, reweighting the premise that silence can colonize a place. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern thickens rather than causal chain—and the final image of “slow, warm ember” makes the cost atmospheric rather than personal. Orientation is clear by line 50; no penalty. The shard’s teleport from shop to bench without on-page transition is a minor logistical flicker but does not rupture the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each lyrical recursion adds translucent strata of memory until the garden’s marble flesh iridesces. The filament’s threading of the cracked arch is the single decisive intensifier—memory literally knits stone with living light—so cost is legible as both repair and revelation. Closure is a Charged Poise: the water’s lullaby crystallizes the new, nuance-tuned status quo without resetting the garden to old certainty. The final image reweights all prior “lifeless yet alive” paradoxes into a stable, luminous stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine holds: dice rolls → step-tilt → staircase quiver → perceptual rupture. Orientation is swift; closure lands as Charged Poise on the 20th landing with the chipped face finally up, reweighting prior failure. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the stairs now sing an anthem of endless flawed motion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the greenhouse light reframes the courier’s memory and the city’s smog in one charged breath, re-pricing kindness itself; the cost is ambient yet legible. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than plot-domino, taught early by the moon-brush-link-to-daydream pattern, and the lens holds. No orientation debt; who/where settled by line 3. The final image crystallizes stakes without explanatory blur.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated sensory images (rosewater, emerald, yeast) accrue density until the amphitheatre doors thaw and the stage re-lights; closure is a Charged Poise where displaced persons “finally felt at home.” Causality is associative rather than strict because/therefore, acceptable under the lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words. Cost is atmospheric—loss of dread—rather than a tangible forfeit; still palpable on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is lean and legible: yoyo cipher → gear translation → stone-amplified motion → engine ignition → beacon blaze; each step because/therefore links. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse’s new pulse rewrites coastal fate, and the price—maker’s erasure into myth, stone gone dim—is legible in the final image. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“rocky island… soaked coat”). No lens ambiguity; the story ends under the same Causal lens it opens with. The only bar to 9.0 is that the cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present—Mara’s “vanish” repels the fear-figure and she accepts the perpetual beacon burden—so Decisive Change with conceptual cost (carry the luminance) is legible. Causality, however, is lyrical-accumulative, not because/therefore: dream-dictionary rule is introduced post-hoc at climax, breaking earlier agency linkage. Orientation cues (who, when) are delayed behind ornate scenery; spatial logic inside mirror-maze is impressionistic, not trackable. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural, but pattern is taught too late to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: one looping cadence of cloud-dub-orchestration grows denser until orchard = instrument. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the final hum reweights earlier beats, but cost is conceptual, not felt. Because/therefore links are soft (“he realized…he responded”) and the orchard’s agency crowds out the prophet’s decisive change. Orientation (who-where-when) is clear by 50 words; no teleporting, yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s realization that the lost expedition became the pattern itself reweights the premise and forecloses her old cartographer stance with undeniable conceptual cost (“she vowed to keep listening”). Causal linkage holds throughout—each whistle note tightens turtle response → mosaic crack → passage opens → watchers answer—so the lens is Causal. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“sunlit harbor… Shellhaven”), well within the 120-word allowance. Persistent constraint (gate rusted shut, mosaic sealed again) shapes her tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the silver ink freezes in sunlight, reweighting the entire mythic rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—hope can survive only if the lie is transmuted, not repeated. Causal lattice holds: the letter’s glow → ivy retreats → beam strikes → noble lie dissolves; each because/therefore tightens options until the final image forecloses nostalgia. Orientation rock-solid by 120 words; transitions are micro-shifts inside the single station space. Cost is visible: “the weight of centuries settled like dust” becomes the lighter dust of honesty that will still sting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lifted drawbridge and inkwell glint re-weight the pavilion’s absence into her ongoing task, cost legible in the river’s sigh. Causality holds—each note placed because the last one was—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words (who, when, where). No meaningful tightening beyond the single vow; a second beat of risk would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal chain is legible: indexer → hypothesis → vault → charter proven → city acts. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the stamped glyph reweights civic memory. However, the blackout’s time pressure loosens after the first scene; once the council funds lights, urgency evaporates and the vault descent feels convenient rather than compelled. Stamp-cipher reveal is a late rule-add that the narrative retroactively justifies, not one seeded with visible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the basilica ascends/descends while cranes carry grief skyward, a charged poise that reweights the premise. Causality is soft—dream-polishing rules are revealed mid-stream and the noon-shadow mechanic is never motivated—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than tight Causal. Orientation is clear by paragraph 3, but the surreal physics (shadow rises by falling) risks momentary drift. The final image earns its awe, yet the price (lantern empty, grief “dissolving”) is declared, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9-band precision.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of crystal resonance images tightens stakes toward the final Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no penalty. The seam-fissure reveal is a pattern break that reweights the unused-potential stake; closure image—“shards hovering like a constellation”—makes the conceptual cost undeniable. One hairline slip: “he realized” twice in closing beats; tiny, but keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the matrix chip’s chord reconfigures “belonging” from abstract quest to shared resonance, with conceptual cost that future seekers will keep arriving to pay. Causal linkage holds: star-trail lever pull → chip activation → frequency release, each step a therefore. Orientation anchor (who/where) appears by line 10; no debt applied. The pilgrim’s exit token is a persistent constraint, promising continual stewardship—cost felt even after page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands cleanly: the watch-hand pressed to wood reconfigures the protagonist’s future practice under a Resonant Reconfiguration of “honest memory.” Causal chain holds—envelope summons → driftwood sift → phrase emerges → hand set down—though the envelope’s gold promise never meets an on-page forfeiture, slightly blunting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope drop and synchronized dawn release reweight the premise with conceptual cost (shared vulnerability). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each moon reference tightens the cadence rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is swift; parapet, night, and drizzle are anchored by line 3. The only slip is a mild loop—“furrowed hush” appears twice in adjacent beats—dulling the final image fractionally.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass steadies, the sea offers acceptance, and the stance shift is legible. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; the tightening is the sunrise dissolving sorrow, a pattern break that reweights stakes. Cost is felt—“regrets would always linger”—but the price is conceptual, not dramatized on-page in the final beat. The drive lens holds, yet the price could be more viscerally attached to the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—ball sunk, lake brightens, empathy seeded—visible cost is the act of relinquishing the talisman, reweighting the premise. Causal chain is thin: newspaper clues arrive as lyrical floaters, not because/therefore triggers; the mirror choice is purely receptive, not a fork that forecloses an alternate path. Still, the final image cleanly reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9- gate for Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mutual touch reconfigures both beings and forecloses pure human life for Liora with visible bark skin. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each spice-gathering beat thickens moonlit mood until the veil thins—but the cookie fortune functions as ornamental echo rather than causal trigger, slightly blunting the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image thickens the same stake—redeeming lost time—until the crystal blossom reweights the premise. Orientation lands cleanly by line 8 (who, where, when). The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the droplet placed on twins’ foreheads crystallizes reclaimed seconds and repatterns meaning, with cost lodged in the cartomancer’s vanishing. Causality remains associative rather than strict because/therefore, appropriate to the lyric mode, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens: imagistic refrains (“faint shimmer,” “stitch,” “seam”) tighten toward the rupture-garden. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dimension blossoms, Nara weightless, cost legible in her irrevocable exile from the ship. One shard, no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed fireflies stitching a “luminous tapestry” re-weight her earlier charitable wanderings into destiny, and the cost—her prior exhaustion and the jar’s loss—remains legible. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of glow (bugs → sand → sky) intensifies until meaning, not plot, pivots. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causal gaps. Meets the 9+ quick test except the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: blackout hush → encoded sundial → bronze quill → cradle activation → cognitive ripple. Each beat adds density and narrows the stake from “find the cradle” to “ignite minds.” Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fort’s pulse is rewired, soldiers rewrite logbooks, Kael’s quill is “now a simple ornament”—a charged poise with visible social cost. No causal gaps; orientation is anchored by line 3; the final image reweights all prior glimmers.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the violet flame maps the rocks, the tide listens, and Selene’s stance is re-configured—prophecy becomes tool rather than trap. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the pattern of stones-dust-flame is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 and held. A slightly stronger material cost (burnt fingers, cracked stone) would sharpen the “felt” prong and nudge this toward 8-plus.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty envelope and glowing ink map reweight the premise—scars become breathable terrain, not wounds to heal. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each sensory beat (ozone, lightning, drizzle) thickens the cartography metaphor until the timer’s ring crystallizes the shift. The 120-word orientation test is passed—who/where/when anchored by “spiral stair…observatory…restless clouds.” Persistent constraint: the sealed envelope mechanism recurs, its hollow twelve-o-clock column now a future mouthpiece, cost felt as continued silence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the philosopher maps the riddle-answer onto the sundial, sealing the overture into a public “map” for future scholars—an undeniable social cost for both duelists. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical rather than strict because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (waiting-for-still-water ritual) and coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear before 120 words; no penalty. Sundial geometry works as persistent constraint; final pinning of needles to its angles satisfies 9+ quick test. Minor slip: duel escalation summarized more than dramatized, keeping score sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library-lantern image reweights the premise, asserting that rebuilt shelves = sanctuary, with implicit social cost of perpetual vigilance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyric repetitions (“as the moon cleared the skyline”) tighten the cadence toward the final glowing stanza. Orientation is lyric-delayed; who/where/when are legible by line 5, so no penalty. However, causality is loose: the coffee-tin seeds appear and sprout without any obstacle chain; the rebellion’s spread is summarized rather than tested, muting the tightening required for 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the clock’s single tick then stop reweights time itself, a conceptual repricing with undeniable cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reel splice and compass flicker thickens pattern until night’s velvet admits the encore—but no tightening beat forecloses a live option; the ascent feels fated rather than chosen. Orientation is taught early (“deserted platform… frozen hands”) so no penalty, yet the missing because/therefore pivot keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed sprouts and the ridge exhales stories, reweighting meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—collective memory is now a living conduit. Causal chain holds: each translated dream symbol brightens the lanterns, tightening toward the sprout. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by word 40. One scaffold loop—“the seed would only sprout before the monsoon arrives” repeated in paraphrase—slightly dulls momentum but does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of lace-knots + compass hue deepens toward cerulean glow. Closure achieves Charged Poise—compass points east, island inhales, sorrow diffused; cost is communal, not individual, but legible. Causality soft: why spoken lace affects compass is occult, not taught, so beat-by-beat traction thin. Orientation clear by ~100 words; no meaningful tightening inside 800-word span—mood accretes, options never narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe “preprocesses reality through countless tiny disturbances,” reweighting Mara’s scientific worldview with irreplaceable humility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via dust patterns, humidity shifts, and beam cracks—culminating in a greenhouse that breathes. Cost is legible: she abandons grand cosmic drama for unseen, incremental influence. Orientation anchors immediately; causality flows through observed change, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring frost, ledger, and glass motifs that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: purpose resides in pauses, not grand gestures. Closure lands decisively—the luminous shards reframe fire as generative, not destructive, with felt cost (the scorched workshop, the lost past). The ledger’s transformation from contraband log to survival guide reweights the entire narrative. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern is taught early and paid off at dawn’s groove and final kiln.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory and symbolic layering until the final chord reweights silence as song. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: silence isn’t absence but latent music, with cost legible in Mara’s scars and the conservatory’s exhalation. The orientation anchors cleanly by line 30 (who: Mara; where: winterglass conservatory; when: post-storm). The persistent constraint—the broken clock, the unringing world—shapes her entire tactic of sonic resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marlow forecloses his own return by merging with the lantern’s gleam, a visible cost that reconfigures the library from tomb to sanctuary. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—pressure builds via rhythmic intensification of light, sighs, and glowing tablets until the final pulse. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Marlow; where: submerged library; when: after package arrival). Cost is legible in “his silhouette merging with the lantern’s gleam”—a decisive, irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the bell’s recurring tone deepens from signal to symbol, culminating in Charged Poise—Mara’s final watch as the bell catches moonlight crystallizes communal resolve with felt cost (ongoing hunger, risk). Orientation is clear by line 3 (exile leader, ridge, arbor). The closure reweights silence as solidarity, not void, with conceptual cost legible in “amplified quiet would never become a void.” One tightening suffices: the shift from scarcity to organized, anonymous runs.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with breath rhythm and luminous imagery deepening toward a Conceptual Repricing: unused love becomes visible current. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Milo stands at the tunnel’s edge, the world breathing back, stakes reconfigured with felt cost (the tear’s dimming, the lens set aside). Orientation is immediate and stable; causality flows through patterned escalation (breath → map → lattice → release). No structural flaws touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory layering, recurring motifs, and cadence shifts that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: time becomes tactile. Closure lands decisively when the fading photographs vanish and the garden blooms a new arch, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—the loss of memory as material, replaced by living resonance. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Mara, a hedge maze designer…”) and the pattern of decay-to-bloom is taught early and paid off. The final image crystallizes Charged Poise: options (past/future) are legible, fused, and irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery (carnival decay, seed vault, arrow) that converges at closure. The Decisive Change—vault opening and seed planted—is earned by Mara’s decoding of the piano keys, which ties back to personal history. Cost is legible: the crumbling carnival and rusted chains imply societal and personal sacrifice. Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality is maintained through symbolic logic consistent with the world.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: memory as a forge that rebuilds broken trust into resonance. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the device’s final chord reweights the orchard’s grief into hope, with visible cost in “the weight of the orchard's memories settle into her hands.” Orientation is immediate (“sunken orchard greenhouse… Mara… hearing-aid designer”), and the aurora-forge-kelp ecosystem coheres without disorientation penalty. The only flaw: the inciting decision (why this orchard?) lacks causal setup, slightly weakening motivation-to-action linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (moonbeams, flowers, light) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: stolen moments become cherished archives. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the lantern flickers as an open invitation, reweighting the station’s purpose—but cost remains oblique; Lira’s renunciation of theft carries no tangible sacrifice. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the floral code, while whimsical, functions as a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (bookmark, glass, thaw) until the final image reweights the premise: the control room becomes a “cradle for hopeful inquiry.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara’s stance crystallizes as she abandons control to nurture equilibrium, with conceptual cost legible in the surrender of command structures. The bookmark’s sunrise glint and glowing sphere anchor a before/after shift that feels inevitable yet costly. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara steps onto the lever not to destroy but to stabilize, accepting vulnerability as agency. The cost—confessing her hidden self—is legible in the amber fire “rippling through her veins” and the library’s adaptive sigh. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Causal beats), though the seashell’s mechanics verge on convenient magic. The constellations spelling her name backward reconfigures identity without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring sensory motifs (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) until the final image reweights the premise: the map dissolves into the air, becoming part of the silence it sought to chart. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the oracle’s act redefines “mapping” as ephemeral listening rather than fixed notation, with clear conceptual cost (the map cannot be kept, only echoed). Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is maintained through pattern logic, not event chains. The single star’s wink-out provides a precise temporal pivot that tightens pressure without violating lyric coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the robot redefines cleaning as synthesis, with the ice droplets functioning as neural data. Cost is legible in the melting violin—each drop a lost timeline—and the courtyard’s silence after resonance fades. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with cadence shifts mirroring looped timelines. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality remains intact within the lyric framework.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: patterned images (doodles, puddles, projections) accrue density until the forecourt becomes a living canvas of truth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the town’s shift from clenched teeth to transparent reflection is legible in the final image of lingering light on stones, with conceptual cost (freedom without accusation). Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“Mara stood beneath a lone streetlamp”), and causality remains intact through poetic logic. The only flaw: the projector lens’s residual light and phosphorescent ink lack early grounding, risking slight artifact status, but payoff justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garden acknowledges him, affirming mutual tending, with the cost embedded in the paradox of “fragile yet fierce” triumphs. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via marble-polishing ritual, culminating in the fountain’s whispered names. Orientation is anchored early (“garden maze,” “withered vine dresser”), and causality flows through tactile cause/effect: polish → pathway → oak → acknowledgment. However, the “luck gauge” introduces a rule that isn’t meaningfully tested or constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (lever, vines, wings) until the climax reweights them. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: time’s sideways motion is validated by flora unfurling and birds ascending, with tangible cost in the crew’s altered perception (“icy warmth”). The magnetic nexus intensifies causally from setup to payoff, and the final image crystallizes a new cosmic rule without exposition. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern pays off decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ghost departs, lanterns steady, and the house breathes again—each image reconfiguring silence into sacred resonance. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: patterns of water, staff lines, and marginalia coalesce into a cadence shift that reweights silence as meaningful. Cost is legible in the “hush of unstruck chords” and Mara’s bone-deep hum—felt, not stated. Orientation anchors immediately (“flooded opera house,” “violinist named Mara”) with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: truth’s weight shifts from internal burden to externalized resonance, reweighting the premise that certainty is brittle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via smudges, humidity gradients, trembling needles—culminating in a final image where ink glows with absorbed mountain sighs. Cost is legible: auroral sorrow fades into resolve, and the stone’s weight lifts only after calibration and sacrifice. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, radio fragments, and the valve’s oscillation coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing—truth quantified as emotional tonnage. Closure lands via Charged Poise: Mara leaves the wheel, accepting haunting as necessary. Cost is legible (“pressure settle into his own ribs”), though the “hush” timeframe isn’t leveraged causally. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “silence births renewal” reframes the entire premise, charging prior images with new meaning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering, cadence shifts, and recurring motifs (swan, river, dust), culminating in a resonant final image with conceptual cost (the fragility of “crumbling peace”). Orientation is immediate (“dim heart of the catacombs”), and the pattern is taught by paragraph two. No causality breaks; every beat flows from texture to insight.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: mood, image, and motif deepen toward a Conceptual Repricing—ordinary magic as communal resonance. Closure lands via Charged Poise: the final image of villagers humming daily tasks reweights the premise with social cost (magic requires attention, not spectacle). However, the eclipse functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than causal pressure; nothing hinges on its timing beyond ambiance. Cost is implied but never dramatized as loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “displaced axis” is redefined as gentle realignment, not fracture, with conceptual cost—the end of human dreaming as baseline reality. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: fragments cohere into resonance, not causality. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“reclaimed silo library,” “odd historian”). The vault discovery tightens stakes by transforming passive observation into ritual participation, fulfilling the single meaningful deepening required.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery until the closure crystallizes as Conceptual Repricing: open secrets become transmissible truth. Cost is legible—the dissolution of privacy, the burden of encoded lives—but feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned. The inciting incident (microdot specs) triggers transformation, yet causality leans on poetic coincidence (lantern flicker as “acknowledgement”) rather than character-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the indigo light exposes hidden assumptions, shattering stillness and reweighting the city’s reality with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint—density of resonant imagery builds until the pattern breaks at climax. Orientation is immediate (“waning cathedral that floated between worlds”), and the loop pedal’s spiral structure pays off in the final cascade. Cost is legible in the “shackled city’s heart” now unbound—a transformation earned through escalating tonal prayer.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lian’s stance crystallizes as conductor, reweighting her identity with conceptual cost—abandoning cryptic detachment for vulnerable creation. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density of sensory motifs (ice, glass, shell, sound) intensifies until the mirrored horizon fractures into batons of luminous sound. Orientation is clear by line 2 (who: Lian; where: glass spire by frozen lake; when: dawn). Cost is legible in the final image—the lake shimmers with color only she can now see, implying isolation even in triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tablet dissolves, timelines seal, and he “falls upward,” crystallizing a stance that forecloses linear selfhood with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density via recurring images (rain, pulse, brightness) that reweight meaning at the end. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“glowing viaduct after rain”), and the pattern of fracturing/reintegration pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern shifts from tomb to resonant space, and Marin’s emotional frost dissolves—felt cost rendered through marrow-deep vibration and glowing filament. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via spirals, backward songs, and hush filaments converging into a charged final image. Orientation is immediate (“cavern,” “Marin,” “broken needle”), and the single scene tightens coherently. No causality breaks; every turn stems from Marin’s deliberate acts.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara chooses lateral action over direct confrontation, accepting isolation while affirming truth’s resilience. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered tranquility, humming air, and sealed wax until the shaft becomes a resonant conduit. Cost is conceptual (truth must travel unseen) and felt (no human courier can cross). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30; causality flows via intuition, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered scents and phosphorescent imagery until the ultraviolet reveal crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Arlen redefines grief as a lantern of understanding, with tangible cost (tears, vial sealing, enduring sorrow). The greenhouse setting and perfume vial cohere as pressure sources, and the ending image reweights all prior motifs. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits the word count perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the poet binds the rope, foreclosing the soul’s release but weaving his story into the grotto’s memory. Cost is legible in the “sealed echo” and reinforced by the walls “breathing” in response. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via layered mineral glaze, concentric tunnels, and spiraling patterns—culminating in a cadence shift at dawn that crystallizes stakes. Orientation is clear by line 30: who (poet), where (terra-cotta grotto), when (post–energy beings’ arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined from void to “space waiting to be filled,” with conceptual cost legible in the villagers’ transformed understanding.

The final image crystallizes stakes without mechanical resolution, satisfying Charged Poise with poetic rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering until the static “maps invisible currents” and culminates in Charged Poise: Mara steps into the city with a saturated petal, options legible (harvest again), cost felt (emotional labor as cloak). Orientation is immediate (“amber grotto at dusk”), and the closure image—her smile reflecting amber light—reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost: counterfeit empathy as necessary illusion. The faint chime marks transformation completion, making the before/after legible without causal plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, with motifs (locket, library, sea) accruing emotional weight toward a Conceptual Repricing: compassion as communal cargo. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the locket on the balcony reweights silence into shared narrative—but cost remains abstract; no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is dramatized. Orientation is clear early, and the misdelivered envelope functions as a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, patterned imagery (webs, circles, light), and communal participation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—belonging is rewritten as an active, living practice. Closure lands decisively when Lira finds the tag on a leaf, revealing it as a growing symbol, not a static mark; this reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost (the work never ends). Orientation is anchored cleanly by line 3 (“Arlen drifted along the crystalline orchard…”), and the drive lens holds coherently through the ending’s steady glow.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory and rhythmic density that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: time is not linear but sculptable, and echoes are born in suspended moments. Orientation is immediate (“rooftop canal system,” “Mira… at dawn”), and closure lands decisively—the city’s rhythm is restored, Mira becomes the echo, and the pendant dissolves into promise. Cost is legible: she releases the pendant, surrendering control to restore balance. The “interrupted cadence” resolves into steady rhythm, reweighting the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: ambiguous loss is redefined as transformative subtraction that enables addition, crystallized in the final image of luminous petals carrying remembered sight. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via sensory layering (drips, cracks, vibrations) until the stone’s pattern yields glowing numbers. Cost is legible: the conjurer accepts loss as rhythm, not void, and the orchard’s silent pulse becomes charged poise. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the “sapphire hush” and tape fragment accruing resonance until the closure image reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“crawl space dweller,” “oldest library,” “early morning”). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren steps from shadow into visibility, foreclosing anonymity with the cost of exposure. The flickering lights and phantom patrons create consistent pressure without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marlowe endures by releasing control, and the linden leaf’s transformation reconfigures his understanding of growth. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density, patterned imagery (droplets, mycelium, copper), and cadence shifts that culminate in the leaf’s “quiet surrender.” Cost is legible: his relinquishment of agency is the price for witnessing authentic metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where rain trails, pigments, and memory coalesce into a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara trades her canvases for a glimpse of renewal, and the island responds with mist that “varnishes” her colors. Cost is legible—the surrender of her life’s work—and the closure reweights the premise: art isn’t just record but ritual. Orientation is immediate (“tide had retreated… Keralan… Mara”), and causality flows via sensory accumulation, not mechanical plot. The convergence’s activation through the altar feels mythically coherent, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery rather than causal chain. Orientation is immediate and vivid: who (Lira), where (musical crystal cave), when (dusk to next day) are anchored within 60 words. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing—the cave’s “bright darkness” reweights everyday magic into sacred possibility—but cost remains oblique; the amber tear and seed bread feel symbolic rather than sacrificial. A single meaningful deepening occurs (the pearl’s activation), sufficient for this length, though stakes never concretely narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archivist’s solitary labor becomes communal chorus, with cost felt in the quiet surrender of authorship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragment deepens the sea’s memory-tide—and the final chord invites co-creation without resolving all gaps. The distant shout at the end introduces a new absence, preserving narrative breath while affirming mission. Orientation is immediate and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the fortress is revealed not as stone but as a living archive, reweighting the entire quest with conceptual cost—she must now bear witness perpetually. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: patterned arrows, ticket punch, and constellations intensify toward a resonant final image. Every clue causally seeds the next move, and the starlit vault’s echo ties opening to closure without disorientation or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira’s realization that the “unheard symphony” is a feeling to inhabit crystallizes options and reweights the entire premise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (whales, stars, tile) until the final cadence shift (“memory, like migration, is a journey that repeats yet never exactly mirrors its predecessor”) delivers conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and functional; every beat tightens around the central stake of sculpting reflective space.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is immediate: an immortal in a crystalline cavern during a solar storm. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds magnetic resonance, spatial instability, and farewell echoes into a Conceptual Repricing: goodbye as transition, not end. Closure lands with visible cost (emptiness dissolving) and the lattice settling into serenity. Every beat intensifies the magnetic-textural density without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: grief thickens into fog, ink glows, symbols melt—each sensory intensification reweights the dominant stake (asylum as covenant). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: bureaucracy’s “rigid walls dissolve” via glowing equations, transforming legal refuge into moral reciprocity with undeniable social cost. Anchors (funeral home, ink pot, Mara) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. The breach isn’t a door but a “shift in consciousness”—a precise, on-page reconfiguration that fulfills the drive without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: invented histories are reframed as bridges across time’s chasm. Cost is legible in the town’s silence and the stationer’s solitary labor, though not deeply felt in bodily or emotional terms. The pattern of light, hum, and ink builds coherently, and the final image crystallizes meaning without mechanical resolution. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the drive lens holds steadily to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the label reweights the port’s silence into recoverable history, with the cost being permanent namelessness now repurposed as conduit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—fragments layer into palimpsest, density increases via radio snippets, and the tide’s rhythm structures revelation. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; disorientation serves closure. Cost is legible in “texture of memory I could touch”—a lived, bodily reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory density, resonant repetitions (“whisper of closing pages,” “resonant hums”), and cadence shifts build toward a Conceptual Repricing closure—the riddle resolves not as a puzzle but as a testament to myth’s survival through retelling. Cost is legible in Selene’s shift from epistemic certainty to melodic openness, crystallized in the final image of her walking toward sunrise with an “ever-changing melody” as compass. Orientation is anchored crisply by line 3 (who, where, when), and the pattern is taught early (wind as page-turn, shell as talisman). The ephemeral compass’s wild spin embodies Charged Poise—options reconfigured, stakes clarified, cost implied in relinquished fixity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered graffiti, spatial reorganization, and communal coordination, culminating in the phoenix mural’s public defiance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the council postpones privatization, the community guards the “living map,” and Mira braces for future fights. Cost is legible: the constant labor of resistance, the fragility of harmony, and the ever-present threat. Orientation is immediate and sustained; the raft city’s rules are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the photograph reweights time itself, transforming decay into legacy. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and ritualized procedure until the dawn hush crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the inspector’s tremor of grief and the grain’s imminent erasure. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the chemical timer functions as a taught pattern that pays off precisely at sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory density and rhythmic cadence until the Charged Poise closure: Mara’s repaired drone hovers as the ship departs, crystallizing her role as unseen architect of new horizons. Cost is legible in the “slight lag in wing flex”—a data point bearing the weight of future journeys—and the anchor’s lift vibrates through her chest, tying external event to internal resonance. Orientation is immediate and sustained; the depot, dawn, and blind artisan are anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: condensation patterns, falcon returns, and glass imprints layer into a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Cost is legible in the tolling bell, cracking ice, and Mara’s “dread” that borders on hope—each symbolizing irreversible thaw. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3 (“rusted outpost by a frozen lake… Mara”), and the pattern of breath-script → phrasebook glyph → transmitted signal is taught early and paid off cohesively. The ending crystallizes stakes without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the town revives not through labor alone but through the tuner’s rhythmic pact, crystallizing a new balance between spirit and stone. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via sensory cadence (footsteps, hums, scents), culminating in tangible rebirth. Cost is legible: the tuner’s solitary vigil, implied by “infinitely patient,” pays the price of communal renewal. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3, and causality flows through resonance, not logic—appropriate for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara relinquishes hope (beacon) for a higher purpose, with visible cost (abandoning rescue). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory and symbolic layering until the “gathered hush” reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the fading signal and rising tide. One flaw: the bioluminescent fish spelling “unsnael” feels ornamental rather than causally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy transforms from false alarmist to truth-bearer, crystallizing his role in a Charged Poise where silence becomes redemptive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of recurring images (lattice, copperlight, hush) builds toward reweighting. However, causality falters: the door “left ajar for decades” functions as deus ex machina, and the map’s discovery lacks prior setup. Cost is conceptual (erasure of past shame) but not viscerally felt in action.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the ghost bride’s dissolution constitutes an Earned Stasis that forecloses her haunting, paid for by her self-sacrificial breath. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear from the outset—the story builds resonance through repeated visits, bead-glow intensifications, and vine awakenings—and holds cohesively to the end. Cost is legible in the “sigh that tasted of roses and rust” and the scattering ash-veil. The pattern is taught early, and the ending reconfigures the orchard’s meaning without breaking its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (orchids, seams, tide pools) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth transformed into a “tapestry of stone and light.” Closure lands via Charged Poise—the final image of the plate reflecting sunrise as a “living map of hope” reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the guilds’ broken precedents, empty tide pools). However, causality lacks tightening; the sleepwalking method produces change without visible resistance or consequence, softening escalation. The cost is implied (silence, emptiness) but never dramatized as a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through repeated motifs (roots, bones, light) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the altar’s restoration reweights silence into voice. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“diaspora returnee,” “catacomb orchard,” night-to-dawn timeframe). The closure—a quiet voice thanking Mara—delivers conceptual cost (faith mended through labor) without physical toll, satisfying CR criteria. No causality breaks, though escalation relies on atmospheric thickening rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs—chalk, clipboard, arcade glow—that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the letter becomes a vessel of encoded hope, reweighting surface mail as sacred transmission. Closure lands decisively with the drone’s ascent and Mara’s quiet assurance, carrying conceptual cost (the sacrifice of anonymity for connection). Orientation is immediate (“golden arcade at dawn”), and the pattern of ritual→activation→dispatch is taught early and paid off cohesively. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the stitched tapestry reweights truth as something sewn, not seized, with the ember’s fading into ash marking irreversible conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density builds via layered sensory motifs (flame, silk, leaves), culminating in a cadence shift at dawn that crystallizes change. The coup remains off-stage, but its imminence tightens every beat, and the final image (“stitched sky as proof that truth could be sewn”) delivers undeniable reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the apology dissolves into the mangrove, reconfiguring silence from burden to release. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered sensory motifs (condensation, shard, spirits), culminating in a cadence shift at the lagoon. Cost is legible: the unsent letters’ weight evaporates, but only after being voiced—a felt emotional price. Orientation anchors immediately (“cryptic medium,” “mangrove labyrinth”), and the pattern pays off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images (mist, coral, smudged notes) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: shared trauma becomes communal strength. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the droplet sealing “new meaning into the old wound”—with felt cost in the translator’s lingering ache. However, causality between the anesthetic’s onset and the sudden legibility of the notes lacks grounding; the shift feels atmospheric rather than earned by prior logic, slightly muddying the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition and sensory layering until the final image reweights the premise: light as communal joy. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing—the orchard shifts from tomb to garden not through action but through reframed perception, with cost implied in centuries of lost joy now reclaimed. Anchors (who, where, when) are established by line 30, and the daydream structure serves the closure rather than obscuring it. The fresco fragment’s dissolution into starlight crystallizes a Charged Poise where past and future coexist.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered sound, light, and memory until the garden’s chorus crystallizes into a Charged Poise closure: Lena’s heartbeat syncs with the garden, foreclosing old certainties. Cost is legible in the dissolution of familiar murals and the irreversible embrace of curiosity. The hobo nickel’s activation sequence is causally tight, and the “pause between question and reply” functions as both temporal anchor and structural hinge. No orientation debt; who, where, and when are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density and patterned imagery converging into a Conceptual Repricing: thought cannot be taxed if embedded in living systems. Closure lands decisively—the greenhouse becomes a “living archive of rebellion,” with cost legible in the silent insects, cracked seed, and Mirabel’s protective choice. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (“metallic echo… pulse from the glass”) pays off in the final kaleidoscopic warp.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (lullabies, coral, nebulae) until the climax—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the poet kneels in earned stasis, having foreclosed isolation by releasing his song into the world. Cost is legible in the “pain that had once lodged in his chest” now transformed, and the galaxy postcard’s evolution from object to catalyst is tightly woven. Orientation is immediate (“gargantuan shell… turquoise reef”), and the closure image reweights all prior longing with iridescent hope.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered images (glass orchids, cracked chime, opal light) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: memory survives not through preservation alone but through transmission (the traveler inhaling names). Cost is legible in the caretaker’s cyclical sorrow—“foxglove regret return[ing] in a softer shade”—and the closure crystallizes purpose without neat resolution. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the pattern is taught early, paying off in the final hum that brushes “the horizon with hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive breathes again, and Elara’s covenant renews dialogue, foreclosing eternal silence with conceptual cost (centuries of breach acknowledged). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through glyph-by-glyph symphonies until the final chord crystallizes meaning. Time pressure (“before paths diverge”) tightens options credibly. The keepers’ emergence validates change without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: sensory density (stone breath, amber glue, binary pulses) builds until the floodgate’s turn reweights the city’s conflict via Conceptual Repricing—water as conversation, not conquest. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the elder’s silence, the ash settling, the chain becoming a symbol—all crystallize a before/after. Orientation is immediate (“crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano”), and the single scene tightens around one dominant stake. The final image of sapphire-thread water glinting fulfills Charged Poise with social and emotional cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (dust motes, paper trails, meteorite hum) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: memory and loss can coexist with renewal when anchored to shared, traveling fragments. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the glowing map on the attic wall crystallizes Lila’s reconfigured relationship to the past, with visible cost in the “inevitable wilt of memory.” The meteorite chip’s fading light and the pigeons’ returned whispers provide legible, felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the true distance is “between wonder and understanding,” crystallized in the child’s return as threshold-keeper. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of recurring motifs (grain, code, hush) intensifies toward a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (loss transformed into stewardship). Orientation is clear by line 30; the drifting terrace, amber stalks, and copper plate anchor who, where, and when without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through luminous imagery and rhythmic repetition until the dome’s holographic revelation reweights the premise—a valid Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Aria; where: underwater facility; when: pre-dawn). However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options or felt trade-off; the city responds readily, and sunrise functions more as a soft deadline than a pressurizing constraint. Cost is implied (“ash can illuminate new horizons”) but never dramatized as loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bridge reappears not by external force but through Maren’s emotional attunement, foreclosing the path of passive forgetting with visible cost—the fragile, fleeting nature of recollection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via seed-hue-glass iterations until the fissure mends. Every beat links through sensory-emotive logic (“melancholy teal” → forgotten bridge), and the final laugh carries joyous/mournful duality that crystallizes stakes. Cost is legible in “fragile tide that recedes before memory fades.”

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tide washing away ink leaves the bishops clean, symbolizing cyclical renewal with conceptual cost—the performer’s labor is transient, yet he persists. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (bishops, ink, stars) culminating in the violin’s X-shaped melody. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“tidal arcade under stars”), and the pattern pays off cohesively at the end. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyrical repetition and sensory layering until the ink’s inscription reweights the premise: exile becomes pilgrimage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the garden, stars, and dancer unify, and the cost (years of solitude) is legible in lines like “the exile within her dissolve.” Orientation is clear by line 3; the pattern of gaps and tides is taught early and pays off in the final image. No causality breaks; the drive lens holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure qualifies as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira reweights the mundane as revelatory, with the final image of the harbor “balancing its hidden ledger.” However, the cost is conceptual but oblique—no tangible or emotional price is paid on the page, only acknowledged. The Orientation Test passes cleanly (who/where/when established by line 2), and the pattern of light, stone, and ripple is taught early and pays off, though escalation lacks a tightening that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (cracks, moonlight, ash) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: innocence isn’t bought but gifted back through reflection. Cost is legible—the weight of the box, the smoldering valley, Maren’s scars—and the closure image (light cascading like rain, children’s smiles) reweights the entire premise. Orientation is immediate (“moonlit ridge path,” “scarred forest firefighter”), and the single scene holds coherence. The pact’s mechanics remain slightly abstract, but the emotional and symbolic cost lands decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of decoration, light, and equation-laden balloons build toward a Conceptual Repricing—the gauge as a mirror of collective hope. Closure lands decisively when the needle steadies at zero, reweighting the artifact’s meaning with conceptual cost (the community’s prior despair). Orientation is clear by line 30; causality is maintained through rhythmic intensification rather than plot turns. A single tightening occurs when the pearl-kelp balloon aligns equations with optimism, foreclosing the era of broken measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered echoes, seasonal shifts, and tactile artifacts. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the map is redefined not as corridors but as “collective imagination.” Cost is legible—the legacy’s burden becomes shared communion—and the final image (“faint dream hum”) reweights all prior material with emotional and conceptual weight. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern is taught by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (mirrors, lullabies, heartbeat) until the final cascade of doors—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights reality itself. Orientation is anchored early: who (painter), where (terrace), when (hush before bells). Cost is legible: the painter’s effort culminates in a world-altering vision, though the personal price remains oblique. Closure lands with poetic force but lacks a felt sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds through sensory layering (firelight, crickets, jasmine) until the swords’ placement reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the altar becomes “living,” the clipboard a canvas for reconciliation—with clear conceptual cost (“willingness to let go of old grudges”). Every beat tightens around the central stake, and the celestial choreography mirrors thematic balance without causal overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the salt flat now holds a ghostly chorus, reconfiguring silence into song, with undeniable conceptual cost—the cruelty of the manufactured drought remains unacknowledged by the world. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear by midpoint and held through closure, with pressure escalating via sensory density (cracks as map, brine as amplifier) culminating in the egg’s fracture. Cost is legible in the final image: “a fragment of grace forged from cruelty.” Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (abstracted geography) pays off in the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (snow, threads, prism) that crescendo into a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s lullaby shatters, replaced by individual voices. Orientation is anchored early (“silver courtyard under snow,” “midnight”), and closure lands as Charged Poise—the courtesan vanishes, leaving a world transformed, with cost implied in the irreversible break from conformity. However, the final image leans heavily on metaphor without grounding the social or personal price in a specific, felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (ember, strings, hush) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: storytelling as invitation, not imposition. Orientation is immediate (“decommissioned radar dome,” “Selene,” “night sky”), and closure lands via Charged Poise—the final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost (abandoning authorial authority). The meteor hush and half-lit epiphany function as taught motifs that pay off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, which it teaches early and sustains: sensory density, cadence shifts, and recurring motifs coalesce into a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the temporary structures dissolve, but their memory becomes a signal for future seekers. The Orientation Test is passed by line 3 (“verdant grotto suspended above the clouds… Lira”), and the closure delivers a Charged Poise: Lira’s enduring presence reconfigures remembrance as active ritual, with conceptual cost (ephemeral monuments vs. stone). The amber veil, moth wing, and bioluminescent knots all accrue meaning toward a final image that reweights the premise—honoring the overlooked through fragility, not grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sensory and symbolic density rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s new braid becomes a luminous map, and the sanctum transforms into a living library—charged poise with conceptual cost (eternal vigilance against forgetting). The inciting act (inserting the scrap) and climax (rope reconfiguration) are causally linked through ritual logic. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the final traveler’s arrival deepens rather than resets the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (vines, seal, directive) until the storm’s arrival triggers a cadence shift and conceptual repricing: the decaying directive rewrites itself. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the paths now choose new walkers—and cost is legible in the protagonist’s transformed understanding and the storm’s physical toll. Orientation is immediate (“vine-draped bunker,” “Foresight Hindsight Only”), and the pattern of dream interpretation → luminous trail → vortex ascent is taught early and paid off cohesively. The nexus moment where time collapses feels inevitable, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (“dusky harmony,” ledger imagery) until the violet glow crystallizes meaning. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing: the magic square reweights mortal accounting as cosmic covenant, with implied social cost (grain stores never empty). However, the “third watch” climax arrives without clear temporal pressure buildup, and the cause-effect between schematics and celestial alignment remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned recurrence of the pin’s reappearance deepening thematic resonance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sanctuary becomes a living archive of released resentment, with tangible cost implied in Mara’s unseen labor and the monks’ surrendered bitterness. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the two-shard structure (monks → wanderer) is cleanly transitioned. One flaw: the reality-shift mechanic enables resolution without prior constraint, slightly softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, frost, breath, and glass layer into a resonant reconfiguration where the dream is captured not by force but attunement. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the repaired sextant points inward, the orchard breathes, and Arlen’s promise carries visible cost (eternal vigilance). Every beat tightens the pattern; the final image reweights “erasing boundaries” as weaving, not deletion. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with closure achieved through Conceptual Repricing: the reframing of fracture as seed of renewal. Orientation is immediate and vivid (“quartz-eye mender… abandoned cathedral orchard”). The decisive act—mending the lenses using orchard-aligned methods—is causally prepared and lands with quiet resonance. Cost is legible in the breached contract’s shadow and the fragile ribbon, though not deeply dramatized; still, the final chime and sharpened vision crystallize a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s constellations reweight inheritance as a networked, looping phenomenon, with the cost being surrender of linear life narrative—made legible when pollen brightens his “disquiet.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via bathroom breakthroughs and shell mosaic until the final cadence shift. Orientation is immediate (“bewildered curator… asteroid”), and the pattern of dissolving questions/reassembling answers pays off coherently at closure. No causality breaks; every image serves the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (gaps, symphony, vines) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s purpose is realized when blank scrolls become living lessons. Cost is legible—the diary’s sacrifice, the midnight naming—and the closure reweights the entire premise. Orientation is immediate (“mountain rose like a stone cathedral”), and causality flows via pattern logic, not linear cause-effect. The final portal shimmer confirms a before/after shift with conceptual stakes intact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with escalating density of lyrical motifs converging at closure. Orientation is clear by line 30: a lone figure on a derelict ship in fog. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the garden’s blooming reweights the premise that names (not objects) hold liberation—with cost legible in “unkindled solace now finally kindled by purpose.” However, the portal-opening and ink-diving lack causal grounding; they feel like atmospheric pivots rather than earned intensifications shaped by persistent constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (seal, rope, door, fables) until the final reconfiguration crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: absence becomes bridge, not void, with clear cost—the clock stops, time is forfeited. The vault’s “impossible seam” and the rope’s reweaving form a coherent causal chain within the established magical logic, and the ending image (“frozen at the moment the impossible door vanished”) makes the conceptual cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the caves achieve “hammered repose,” and the mapkeeper’s vigil continues with renewed purpose. Cost is conceptual—peace requires perpetual labor—and legible in the final image of smoothed ice and glowing charts. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through resonant imagery, culminating in a cadence shift from storm to hush. Orientation is immediate, and causality flows through sensory logic rather than plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the beacon’s rekindling reframes coincidence as cosmic pattern, with tangible cost—the custodian’s lifelong solitude now transformed into communal responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with star paths, hush, and prism layering into a resonant system. The caravan’s arrival deepens stakes without breaking causality; every echo serves the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the drive intensifies coherently to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final insight—that conjecture itself bridges past and future—reweights the entire premise with resonant cost (the burden of endless remembrance). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with fog, light, and sound deepening into a cohesive pattern that culminates in Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate (“stormlit observatory… archivist”), and the single scene unfolds with causal logic via sensory escalation. The only flaw: the crystal’s function shifts from passive resonator to active chorus without clear mechanics, slightly muddying cause in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the fireworks reweight despair into mosaic-like hope, with the fortress’s pulse and blooming walls crystallizing a new rule—that art filters sorrow into light. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with cadence shifts (chants → burst → lingering fire) intensifying thematic density. Cost is legible in the designer’s persistent wandering and oily labor, though the void’s defeat lacks physical consequence. The pattern is taught early (“note in mosaic”) and paid off in the glowing tiles.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: time is reimagined as a sea, not a line, with cost embedded in the chronicler’s quiet renunciation of control—she observes but does not intervene. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered sensory details that culminate in the jade cicada’s glow crystallizing the transition. The “pause” tightens into a Charged Poise where intention shifts before words are spoken. Orientation is clear by line 30, and causality flows through perception, not action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lio’s contracted heart stretches, reweighting his relationship to space and silence. The inverted-gravity hour functions as both literal and metaphorical window, with clear before/after stakes. Orientation is immediate (“child of the bunker builder… beneath the earth”), and the drive lens—Accumulative/Textural—is taught early and held through closure. Cost is felt in the dissolving filaments and lingering scent: silence is transient, requiring disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring sensory motifs until the storm glass bursts into silver—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence as teachable. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Lira; where: misty river on prism terrace; when: post–train whistle). The closure lands with conceptual cost: the vial empties, its purpose spent, and peace is achieved not through action but earned stasis. Every image feeds the final hush, and the pattern is taught early and paid off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory layering and recurring motifs until the throne’s activation reconfigures meaning. Orientation is strong from the first sentence, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: Mina trades solitary guardianship for communal stewardship. However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options—pressure accumulates atmospherically but doesn’t force a difficult trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds density through recurring motifs (scars, starlight, breath) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary shifts from isolation to connection. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“Within this hollowed hall lived…”), and the closure—a Charged Poise where the threshold becomes a bridge forged from scars—carries conceptual cost (irreversible self-exile). The pattern is taught early (fading threshold, doorknocker resonance) and paid off precisely at the end. No causality breaks; every image tightens the thematic weave.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the quantum promise reweights “pressure” from oppressive weight to generative force, with visible cost—the diamonds endure only while pressure remains tangible. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, evidenced by escalating sensory density (mushroom glow → violet curtain → shadowseam wonder) that reconfigures stakes without causal turns. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 30 (“bioluminescent mushroom farm,” “Lira,” “I”). The glitchy texts serve as pattern-taught pressure, not deus ex machina, and the bolt’s reuse across beats tightens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (golden shadows, eloquent silence, standing waves) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as eloquence. Closure lands decisively—the scroll’s confession reframes the dynasty’s fall, and Lian’s purpose shifts from recovery to transmission. Cost is legible in the ancestors’ buried shame and Lian’s burden of reinterpretation. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“sepia reading room,” “young scholar named Lian”), and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orientation is immediate: “withdrawn knight,” “alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night.” The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via recurring motifs (murmured allegiance, forgotten patterns) until vapor forms dream-bridges and script constellations. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the knight’s whispered allegiance reweights loyalty from chain to song, with felt cost (armor dissolving into moss). Reality shifts coherently as textual intensification, not causal plot, fulfilling short-form expectations.

Cost is legible: the “sterile despair” of the lab yields to collective yearning, paid for by the staff’s awakened conscience. Orientation is immediate (“mossy platform,” “observation dome”), and the pattern of resonance→response→transformation is taught by paragraph two and held rigorously.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Whispers are the true currents of this city” reweights the entire premise with undeniable thematic cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the storm’s pulses, glowing map, and resonant objects build density until the final parchment crystallizes meaning. Orientation is immediate (“port city,” “Milo,” “geomagnetic storm”), and causality is maintained through ritual logic. The cost—acceptance of quiet truth over public proof—is legible in the final image of the star-marked map.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: darkness learns starlight’s value, reweighting night’s identity with quiet cost (the guardian’s labor, the dock’s transformation). Orientation is clear by line 3. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies via ripple cadence and mirror alignment. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; pressure is ambient, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images—mist, amber light, chess pieces—until the final pulse unites town and library in a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes communal language. Cost is legible in the mayor’s reversal and citizens planting saplings, signaling irreversible social shift. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt library in mist”), and the pattern of window displays is taught early, paid off cohesively. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town now listens, and the quiet has spoken—with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s internal shift crystallizes into Earned Stasis—defending peace instead of fueling conflict—with conceptual cost (releasing the scrimshaw, inheriting the island’s heart). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sensory density builds to a cadence shift at the whale’s call, reweighting freedom as embrace rather than escape. The island’s permanence post-transformation makes the before/after legible. Minor deduction for slight elision in the transition from dock to altar.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (turbines, bouquet, baton) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “remade hush” now chosen, not imposed. Cost is legible—the emotional void, enforced silence—and closure lands via Charged Poise: Mara’s quiet act reweights sorrow as permissible. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. The turbine acceleration at climax subtly externalizes internal shift without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): boundaries dissolve, the lake glows amber, and the poet’s pulse becomes a guide—all with conceptual cost (the ban’s collapse, sacred walls breached). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shifts, sensory density increases, and the humming quartz responds in kind. The “crack” of folding prohibitions and the final hymn crystallize a before/after. No causality breaks; every image tightens the central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds cohesively: each barter intensifies sensory density until the courtyard’s full awakening. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the realization that “imperfection was the truest melody”—with undeniable cost: Selene relinquishes the dream of perfect symmetry, accepting fractured sight as vision. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation serves the lyrical closure. A decisive intensification occurs when ivy and lotus intertwine, triggering the glass flowers’ birth—a pattern-taught payoff that reweights all prior exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 3: bell ringer, lab, post-grid-stabilization. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with cadence and sensory density intensifying toward closure. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pilgrimage becomes a daily ritual, foreclosing outward travel in favor of inward connection, with cost legible in the “warm yet delicate” settling of dust-like resonance. Every beat accumulates toward this reweighting without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of a fresh crane pointing toward an unseen sunrise crystallizes her reconfigured stance—grief now generative. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with origami constellations and silver threads deepening thematic density. Cost is legible in her stained hands and muted heat of the furnace—tactile residues of loss repurposed as tools. Orientation is immediate (“beneath the vast dome”), and causality flows through ritualized action rather than plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the inherited mystery transforms from burden to compass, reweighting the premise with social cost—the need to rebuild from “digital ash.” The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, escalating via density (tape clicks, card flares, humming walls) until the final droplet reflects a “miniature universe,” crystallizing hope as data. Cost is legible in the snapped tape—a break where “hope could be re-stitched”—and the folded tape as “silent promise.” Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the historian redefines “purification” not as cleansing but as rebirth through unpredictability, with clear conceptual cost—the surrender of rhythm, the burden of reclaimed heritage. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating sensory density and pattern-breaking steps tightening pressure. The bronze prism’s activation is causally tied to his method, and the ending crystallizes stakes without mechanical resolution. A minor flaw: the “atoms of nostalgia” concept lacks concrete on-page evolution, slightly weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library breathes, the stone glows, and the shadow unbound becomes a preserved promise—reweighting time, memory, and legacy with palpable cost (faded moments, luminous regret). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with patterned imagery (kite, stone, clouds) intensifying toward a resonant final image. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“velvet cushion beneath the vaulted arches”), and the drive coheres without causal breaks. Cost is legible in “many such moments had already faded, unrecorded.”

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (mist, layers, color) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s Earned Stasis as she reconstructs trust through ritualized shedding. Cost is legible—the con’s scars, lost credibility—and the final journal entry crystallizes Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate; causality is maintained through symbolic action rather than plot mechanics, fully appropriate for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that “time itself was a wound we could read” reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional cost—years of unresolved pain crystallizing into harmony. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with patterned imagery (coffee rings, scars, sand) deepening toward a resonant final image. The frosted hourglass clearing to reveal sunrise functions as both literal and metaphorical release, satisfying all closure criteria with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that gathering, not finding, transforms unused love. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (“dust... like slow snow,” “thunderous hush”) until the final chord crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the “weight of unsent affection” and the booth’s sigh, though the protagonist pays no personal price. The map’s revelation and liquid-light climax reconfigure the premise without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (stardust, auroras, tracing) until the archway’s eruption delivers a Conceptual Repricing: creativity is liberated, and silence is rewritten. Cost is legible in the dreamer’s fatigue and final stillness—“letting his heart finally rest”—marking a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Orientation is clear by line 3; the archway, instrument, and celestial mechanics cohere without disorientation penalty. Closure lands with emotional and conceptual weight, though escalation relies more on sensory accretion than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world’s lullaby harmonizes, trees of light rise, and the clock ticks backward—signaling irreversible change with conceptual cost (time reversed to birth dawn). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: density builds through recurring images (dune, clock, chant) until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation is immediate (“freight guard,” “terminal,” “after the last forest burns”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt. Cost is legible in the reversed time and the guard’s enduring dreamlessness amid renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned sensory motifs (wind through trees, gear glow, hum of insight) deepen until the climax, where inserting the gear triggers a Conceptual Repricing—redefining “probable miracles” as inherent to perception. Orientation is strong by line 30: who (stray philosopher), where (mechanical rainforest), when (after sixth sense awakens). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world’s song now guides him, with conceptual cost—the surrender of seeking external wonder for internal attunement. No causality breaks, though escalation relies on density rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (star stamp, lullaby, indirect routes) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: courage is not summoned but uncovered. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Mira’s emergence at sunrise reconfigures her relationship to fear, with cost implied in the frayed leash and years of waiting. Orientation is clear by line 3 (village, pier, twilight). One tightening occurs when the ferry turns back at the moon’s shyness, deepening the method of indirectness, though escalation relies more on texture than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: safety’s price is reweighted from physical protection to “the willingness to bear silence,” crystallized in the bolt’s pulse and amber-to-copper shift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and symbolic recurrence, culminating in a Charged Poise where stakes and cost are legible. Orientation is immediate (“cobalt fortress… snowdrift”), and the discoloration’s evolution pays off the early pattern without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the pretender is unmasked, the truth sealed into stone, and the throne’s legitimacy restored—a Conceptual Repricing with tangible cost (the library’s collapse). The Causal lens holds throughout: each beat follows because/therefore logic (ink reveals map → map leads to vault → vault exposes crown → crown triggers rune). The “pause of shifting constellations” frames a tight temporal constraint that resolves cleanly. Cost is legible in the crumbling temple and spent ink pellet.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the discovery that bleached coral lose chemical gradients reweights the entire premise, transforming cartographic gaps into biological symptoms. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the rhythmic tapping, atlas fragment, and data logs coalesce into a resonant final image with conceptual cost (lost navigation). Orientation is immediate (“sea level monitoring station… after the fossil fuel ban”), and the delayed revelation payoff is earned through patterned detail. The watermark’s emergence feels inevitable, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (hum, rust, glyphs) until the stone’s vibration catalyzes change. Orientation is clear by line 30: who (stargazer), where (abandoned repair bay), when (margin of daylight). Closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where rebellion shifts from lull to pulse, with cost implied in the workers’ awe and reclaimed commitment. Yet the escalation hinges on mystical resonance rather than protagonist-driven causality, limiting pressure tightening under stricter causal expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the implanted destiny is reframed from decree to collective invitation, with felt cost (Anara’s lost memories). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via moss whispers, glyph decoding, vapor column—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she reconfigures loss into purpose, foreclosing passive grief with the cost of carrying pain forward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density (pine needle, wind chimes, sea lavender) until the final image reweights everything. Orientation is clear by line 3; the lighthouse keeper’s absence frames temporal solitude without disorientation. Cost is legible: “plant my own beacon” implies lifelong labor, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered sensory detail, recurring motifs (cards, light, threads), and spatial compression (“walls close in”). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elian reweights fragmentation from flaw to medium, crystallized in the phoenix card and redesigned portrait. Cost is legible—the abandonment of wholeness as artistic ideal—and the lighthouse’s hum confirms transformation. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the spiral-to-stairwell progression tightens stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (ink, wind, breath) until the spiral projection crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Kael reinterprets time’s slowdown not as anomaly but as cosmic grace, with conceptual cost (oblivion for those who ignore it). The eclipse timeframe anchors early, and the encampment dissolving beneath him signals irreversible shift. Cost is legible in the vanishing outlines and erased histories—felt even if not physically paid.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and patterned imagery (frost, whispers, hums) until the final image reweights silence as rebellion. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the library transforms from tomb to lighthouse—with undeniable social cost (the council’s authority destabilized). The dormant networks’ activation functions as motivated ellipsis, not coincidence, and the “blink” timeframe tightens causality without breaking it. Every beat contributes to the resonant shift, with no amnesia or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring motifs (sandbag, roses, engraved quiet). Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Lira’s community ritual reconfigures chaos into continuity, with the elder accepting historical weight as emotional cost. However, causality is soft—events accumulate but don’t narrow options; the tower’s fall exerts no active pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s patterns reweave, the spike hums with new symbols, and the fisher internalizes the echo—not as possession but as guiding pulse. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of capture for release, charged by the rail spike’s transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with cadence shifts and pattern breaks escalating pressure toward the climactic chant. Orientation is immediate (“twilight of the sound wave garden”), and every beat tightens the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under a Hybrid lens—Causal logic (proof by contradiction) fused with Accumulative/Textural resonance (orbits of regret, ink as lineage)—held coherently to closure. Orientation anchors are immediate: “Mira,” “marble stair,” “observatory above clouds.” The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s decryption reweights the city’s narrative rule-set, with cost legible in the siren’s announcement and the unwinding “orbits of regret.” The nib’s insertion triggers a causal chain that culminates in publishable truth—a decisive shift earned by premise testing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring sonic and celestial motifs until the amber’s activation reweights the entire premise.

The meteor hush settling “like stardust upon every trembling heart” crystallizes a before/after legible through sensory transformation, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as a language spoken by stones, with the cost being Liora’s surrender of interpretive control to emergent patterns. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via echoing motifs (lilac unease → hush → peace), culminating in a cadence shift at the violinist’s arrival. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Liora... entered the whispering grotto”), and the two-shard structure (Liora then violinist) coheres under a stable Hybrid lens. Cost is legible: her legacy becomes passive invitation rather than active authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with escalating sensory and symbolic density culminating in the naming of “Hearthsteel” as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the plaza’s identity. Orientation is immediate and stable: who (gentle radical), where (ancient plaza), when (after the great fire) are anchored by line 3. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Charged Poise—where the renamed plaza becomes a ledger of promises, with conceptual cost legible in the “chipped fragment[s]” that memorialize loss. However, the transformation hinges on a single mystical act without intermediate pressure or narrowing of options, limiting causal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost achieves peace not through return but through transmission—his echoes become bridges to another’s hope. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating sensory density (glowing apples, humming chords, luminous notes) reweighting the stake from personal redemption to shared possibility. Cost is legible in the ghost’s dissolution into echo, and the tarot coin’s shift from Tower to sunrise crystallizes irreversible change.

The final image—cliffs breathing approval—makes the cost (permanent alteration of reality) legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that “unused courage was not a place but a state” reweights the entire quest, supported by the glowing snow map and altar ritual. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (pillbox, snow, silver hush) culminating in a resonant final image. However, causality falters slightly: the pillbox’s mechanics (vials released by star alignment) feel magical rather than earned, and the luminous river of melted snow borders on convenient. Cost is felt emotionally but not concretely demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (mist as manuscript, river as palimpsest) until the rain gutters fall silent—a pattern-taught cadence shift that triggers closure. The final image offers Conceptual Repricing: complexity distilled into essence isn’t erasure but honoring layers. Cost is felt subtly—the needle’s weight, the ticking’s cessation—but lacks a decisive physical or emotional forfeiture on the page. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the taught pattern pays off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory and temporal density culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: the oasis weaves fractured timelines into a new tapestry. Cost is legible—the lantern’s initial fading, the dormant hives—and the final thrum reweights the premise with conceptual cost (memory as active resistance). Orientation is clear by line 2; the pattern of sun-traced vibrations teaches the nonlinear logic early and pays off cohesively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with lyrical density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s acceptance of Mara’s offering constitutes Earned Stasis. The quivering hush settles into a “steady breath,” marking a clear before/after. Cost is subtly rendered—the implied labor, solitude, and fragility of her mission—but never made visceral or specific enough to fully satisfy the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (sundial, hum, brittle awakenings) until the library “sings” in a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands decisively: Mira steps forward with independence forged from isolation, the cost being the relinquishing of solitude as identity. The stone circle’s hum, introduced early, pays off structurally and thematically. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern is taught and sustained without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating sensory density culminating in the spiral’s activation and celestial reveal. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: love letters gain transcendent agency through art, reweighting secrecy as communion. Cost is legible in Mira’s surrender of authorship—her words dissolve into the temple’s chorus—and the final image crystallizes this shift. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern (prismatic quiet → whispered secrets → luminous revelation) is taught and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the radio station transforms from battlefield to forum via Earned Stasis (Mara’s refusal to weaponize), with conceptual cost (ongoing vigilance) legible in the final image of “ethereal grit.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (charts, subsonic pulse) until the valley-wide chorus reweights division as solvable. Orientation anchors (“old university radio station,” “dust-touched charts”) are clear by line 3. Only minor causality strain: the tricksters’ solar flare gambit resolves too cleanly without prior escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the key is revalued from artifact to symbol, and space itself becomes malleable through story and sound. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via organ tones, compass mechanics, and spatial shifts—culminating in a resonant final image where luminescent fungi echo the organ’s hum. Cost is legible: the explorer sheds claustrophobic limits, but the weight of centuries lifts only after enduring sensory and spatial disorientation. Orientation is immediate (“claustrophobic explorer,” “yawning cavern,” “starlight”), and causality flows through poetic logic without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure intensifying through sensory density and patterned motifs until the quarry “speaks.” Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: the stone’s tear and revealed names reweight absence as presence, with clear cost—the awakening of Mara’s sealed empathy. The inciting incident (evidence disappearance) is functional, but the climax hinges on internal shift, not external causality, which suits the lens. The fissure revealing names feels slightly convenient but is earned by the ritualistic buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring motifs (nail, stanzas, dread) until the final image reweights memory as moral compass. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the station’s shift mirrors the spirit’s return—and cost is legible in Mara’s resolve replacing flight. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; causality remains intact despite lyrical design. The vortex climax tightens stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pixelated amnesty redefines possibility itself, with cost legible in the fiddler’s burden (“weight… settle like ash”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of recurring images (scaffold map, wet-plate, bridge-song) intensifies toward a cadence shift at the summit. However, causality between music and amnesty activation relies on legend rather than dramatized mechanics, slightly weakening the “because/therefore” chain. The Orientation Test is waived—the disorientation serves the lyric payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through recurring images (foreign bills, circus train, loops) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: circles aren’t failures but tests of memory. Cost is legible—the collapse of LoopForge, the fluttering notes left behind—and the final image reweights the entire premise with quiet poise. Orientation is clear by line 30; transitions across time are seamless and motivated. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: hope must be measured, not endless.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (daylily telegram, variable stars, midnight solace) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: truth emerges only when burdens are shared. Closure lands with felt cost—the lifting of doubt through communal resonance—and the pattern is taught early. However, the causal link between dream glyphs and stellar alignment leans on coincidence rather than earned discovery, slightly weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lake transforms from cursed vortex to truthful mirror, and the druid shifts from warlike readiness to open peace, with visible cost implied in her unbent stance and sealed confession. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—pressure builds through rhythmic chant, expanding rings, and shard-gathering—and the frozen confession’s release reweights the entire premise. The inciting failure of the illusionist’s trick cleanly sets up the need for authentic truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant redefines from power pact to dream-duty fusion, with cost felt in the hedges’ scars fading and time folding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering and rhythmic cadence shifts—but causality is soft; the portal opens because the story says so, not because of prior constraint. The cobalt glade inhales, the beacon ignites, yet no irreversible loss anchors the transformation beyond abstract “centuries pressing into fingertips.”

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maelia’s understanding shifts from extraction (“bartered destinies will fill empty vaults”) to reciprocity (“stitches that bound both giver and receiver”). Cost is legible in the burnt card’s transformation and the orchard’s realignment—voids become conduits, despair is trammelled. Orientation is clear by line 3; the pattern of sigils, ash, and roots tightens meaningfully toward the amber-thread resolution. The final image reconfigures the entire premise with conceptual and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator redefines “applause” not as external validation but as internal conviction, crystallizing options with felt cost—the loss of old identity, the quiet resolve to rebuild. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout: repeated echoes, cloth, dust, and light deepen meaning without causal turns. Orientation is immediate (“Echo Valley,” “quarry office trailer”), and the final image reweights prior motifs. Cost is legible in the amber-lit stasis: no grand act, but a stance forged in humility.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered analogies (seed/language, arbor/frequency) until the closure crystallizes as a Conceptual Repricing: translation becomes seed-planting, ambition becomes cultivation. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“Lira… perched on a branch of the magnetic arbor”), and the spirit’s departure establishes the temporal frame. The shimmering seed’s activation, silver particle cascade, and sprouting blossom form a coherent crescendo that reweights the premise with conceptual cost—the spirit is gone, balance restored, but Lira must now test the fruit beyond the cradle. The final image earns Charged Poise: options (journey downward) and stakes (shared enlightenment vs. isolation) are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the librarian seals migrating stories into the glowing creel, crystallizing his acceptance of paradox. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tidal/moon imagery intensifies until the key’s creation reweights routine as wonder-holding. Cost is legible: “gears soften,” a surrender of mechanical rigidity. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3; causality remains intact despite lyrical pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pearl reweights hope as communal rather than individual. Cost is legible—the sealed bunker doors remain, yet inner walls dissolve—but it’s conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern of confession → absorption → radiance is taught early and paid off. However, the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; pressure accumulates without tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator commits to return, accepting the path without resolution, with cost felt in the “fragile stone I finally dared to keep.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of river/graffiti/bellows motifs intensifies toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty. The graffiti poem’s payoff is earned, though the tunnel discovery leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned repetition of “cyclically reversed,” propagation delays, and the watch’s rhythm builds density toward a Conceptual Repricing—realizing the library itself is a living cipher. Closure lands via CR with conceptual cost (the unspoken must be documented to survive), though the stakes never narrow into a decisive physical or emotional trade-off. The orientation is functional due to early establishment of mist, library, and mission.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story lands a Conceptual Repricing: the floating city’s autonomy reweights the value of dreams over imperial control, with visible cost (the envoy’s shared grief, surrendered sword). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds through recurring images (vines, coffee stains, violin) that culminate in luminous ceiling fractures. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality flows via sensory logic rather than mechanical plot. However, the resolution hinges slightly on the envoy’s sudden empathy, which borders on convenient without deeper setup.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Charged Poise crystallizes when the emerald chip pulses in sync with her heartbeat, transforming the grotto into a sanctuary of preserved hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring motifs (static, aurora, threshold) until the final cadence shift (aurora dimming then reigniting). Cost is legible: the aurora dims “a fraction,” signaling real sacrifice. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (hairpin, vines, scalloping rhythm) until the sunrise alignment triggers a Conceptual Repricing: contentment is redefined as cyclical care, not hidden treasure.

Orientation is clear by line 30, and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the wind chime pattern, mirror shard, and cloak of doubt accruing meaning until the final unhooking crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is legible: the magistrate surrenders rigid certainty, and Mara shoulders renewed doubt. The lighthouse setting and dawn timeframe anchor orientation by line 30, and the closure image—sea reflecting light like a mirror—reweights truth as plural. No causality breaks; every beat deepens nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the grotto doesn’t grant youth but teaches *how* to vanish and appear—a reweighting of Mira’s entire quest. Cost is legible in her relinquishment of control (“I will not rush the answer”) and the irreversible deepening of her understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with ripples, rings, and magnetic thrums layering into a resonant lattice. Every beat tightens pressure toward the final crystallization without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces physical navigation in favor of internal mapping, with felt cost in the “weathered resolve” and centuries of dust settling on her shoulders. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via echo, pulse, birds, and stone until the final lattice crystallizes. Orientation is immediate (“mouth of the canyon,” “towers of bone”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: brilliance redefined as “brilliant dimness.” Orientation is clear by line 3; the keystone’s glow reframes all prior failure as latent virtue. Cost is legible in Selric’s relinquishment of institutional validation—his reputation dissolves, replaced by inner certainty. The closure image (fireflies refusing measurement) crystallizes thematic stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the library reveals sound’s color not as abstract theory but as lived, visible truth, reweighting Eli’s entire quest. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (lanterns, light, keys) until the final chord pulses with teal. Cost is legible in the “teal hue that now lingered on his fingertips”—a permanent, sensory transformation. Orientation is immediate (“late-shift lamplighter, Eli, walked his solitary route”), and causality flows via pattern, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with density increasing through sensory layering and patterned repetition of coin pops, static bursts, and stellar doubt. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: purpose is redefined as resonance, not goal. Cost is legible in the micro-fracture of the ambered glass and Silas’s quiet endurance amid cosmic contraction. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“ambered observatory deck,” “Silas,” “every cycle”), and the backwards prophecy’s payoff feels inevitable yet fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where patterned naming intensifies resonance rather than causal chains. Orientation is immediate: “ancient observatory at dusk,” “heartbroken reaper named Lira.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s grief transforms into a bridge—charged by the aurora and constellated name, with conceptual cost (centuries of unfinished farewells released). The tightening occurs when each spoken name melts terror into light, narrowing the path from sorrow to sanctification.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s restoration triggers cosmic realignment and fish return, with conceptual cost in the mage’s vulnerable devotion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dripping cadence builds density until rhythm aligns, reweighting stakes. Orientation is clear by line 2 (“sapphire viaduct at dawn,” “lukewarm mage”). A persistent constraint (lukewarm magic’s limits) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: photographs layer meaning until the final communal revelation reweights the town’s memory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the reservoir shifts from scar to witness—with legible social cost (generational fear lifted). However, the causal link between Caitlyn’s actions and the townspeople’s gathering feels asserted, not dramatized; their arrival lacks on-page buildup, weakening pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (starlings, flame, dew) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: wonder as the bridge between logic and intuition. Orientation is immediate (“hidden orchard… Selene”), and the closure—a phosphorescent bloom sealing inner harmony—carries conceptual cost (the sacrifice of rigid control). The ritual’s progression feels inevitable, with each beat deepening thematic resonance rather than advancing causally, which suits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the reinforced harness crystallizes renewed trust, with the radio’s “Hold fast” confirming stakes reweighted by action. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (buckle, echo, vines) culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible: the burden lifts fractionally only after labor, not completion. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30 (“lofty silence,” “radio static,” “storm”), satisfying early grounding without disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dojo becomes a sanctuary, factions reconcile, and history rewrites itself—all legible through the twin-heartbeat image. The causal chain is tight: Kael’s paradox-blade action directly triggers awakening, emotional restoration, and systemic shift. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who/where/when), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via sensory and conceptual layering until the cadence shift at the cut glass. Cost is undeniable: the sanctity of “originality” is irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through sensory motifs (rain, breath, scent, silence) that culminate in the corpse flower’s bloom—a Conceptual Repricing where mystery becomes tangible. Orientation is immediate: Mara, her shed, the storm, all anchored by line 3. The closure lands with undeniable resonance: the bloom reweights the premise that stories feed life, and the brook’s endless flow promises continuity. Cost is felt as opportunity—Mara commits her creative sanctuary to this living puzzle, foreclosing safer, static designs.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the house regains laughter while retaining haunting, achieving Charged Poise with felt cost (the conductor’s tears, vanished presence). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring sonic motifs that reweight silence into song. The hourglass grain drop functions as a taught temporal anchor, not coincidence. Final image crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution, honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the guardian’s refusal to remove the pendant forecloses immediate escape or resolution, binding it to fragile guardianship with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density and rhythmic repetition (“wait,” “interiorizing exteriors”) until the final image reweights uncertainty as companion. The cultist pendant’s late introduction risks orientation debt, but its payoff in the closure unit justifies its placement.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: the crozier’s revival reconfigures the alchemist’s destiny from cage to canvas—a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable conceptual cost.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (violet glow, humming cables, lunar silver) until the chord resolves into rebirth. Cost is legible: Selin’s pragmatic labor replaces mythic salvation, and the moon’s perigee clock tightens decisions. Orientation anchors instantly (“city of rusted towers… Selin”), and the spiral stairwell/comet tail image teaches nonlinear time early.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ferry’s return reweights time itself from linear loss to woven intention, with visible cost in passengers “stuck between departures” now restored.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses, mist, and marble tears build density until the chord’s resolution reweights silence into a bridge. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“I stood… a contact tracer for hearts”), and the single scene coheres spatially. One tightening occurs—the pulse leading to the alcove—and the dead’s call is answered through earned attention, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the premise by revealing that “invisible threads” can be honored through quiet stewardship, not extraction. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens via sensory density and rhythmic cadence shifts—and holds coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glitch’s error is exposed not by bureaucracy but by poetic defragmentation, reweighting mortality as something counted, not decreed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—ink patterns, heartbeat tally, porcelain resonance build to a crystalline whisper that alters Mara’s understanding. Cost is legible: she endures the ghost’s false death loop until she absorbs its data into her own body. Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the storyteller forgoes immediate comprehension for future possibility, crystallizing stakes in the final image of bone towers whispering the song. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—density increases via layered echoes, bird patterns, and diamond fissures until cadence shift at climax reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible: “once the cursed diamond’s song faded, the language… would be locked forever.” Orientation anchors firmly by line 3; causality flows through sensory pattern recognition, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the beast is revealed not as monster but forgotten song, reweighting the entire mission.

Every beat tightens the thematic stake without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (halo fragment, misting hush, wind bells) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence redefined as generative. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“abandoned circus train,” “Mara,” “broken wooden horse”). Closure lands with cost—the train’s rebirth demands Mara’s ongoing song, a quiet endurance that forecloses passive abandonment. However, the hidden compartment and staircase arrive with minimal causal setup, leaning on lyric convenience over motivated discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory-poetic layering until the star-falls-into-a-lake projection crystallizes closure as Conceptual Repricing: stories live beyond linear shelves, and analog memory is recoverable but fragile. Cost is legible—the reawakening is temporary, requiring “continual care”—and Mara’s ledger entry confirms the labor’s impermanence. Orientation is immediate (“midnight,” “vaulted doors,” “librarian named Mara”), and the pattern of resonance → ripple → projection is taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with patterned imagery (light, jasmine, longing) intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: longing shared becomes enduring light.

However, the “wind sigh” revelation borders on convenient, slightly undermining causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard’s memory returns via songs, saplings reappear, and the sea’s dual role as taker/giver crystallizes. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—the broken constellations, fairy ring, and shipwrecks accumulate meaning until the final patterning realigns narrative fragments. Cost is legible: decades of absence, salt-soaked soil, and lost joy now reclaimed but irrevocably altered. Orientation is immediate (“ghostly greenhouse,” “boots wet from tide”), and causality flows through mythic logic consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)

    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (sunrise, mist, spores) until the final image reweights the premise: wonder persists across worlds. Orientation is clear by line 30 (“verdant parapet beside a waterfall… wise orchard pruner”). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the heirloom seed’s legacy transforms the orchard into a nexus of interwoven realities, with cost implied in the pruner’s lifelong vigilance. However, no on-page sentence explicitly renders the cost as undeniable, slightly softening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with density increasing through repeated motifs (hush, knots, starlight) until the final cadence shift: the net collapsing into a single thread that binds the mask. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—as Elara seals the sanctuary in calm, foreclosing future unrest with visible cost (her lingering exhaustion, the spirits’ fading whispers). Orientation is immediate (“prism sanctuary under starlight”), and the pattern pays off without disorientation debt. The final image reweights silence from absence to sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the servant retrieves joy, returns it to the spire, and renews his vow—foreclosing personal possession with quiet cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light, symbols, and objects layer meaning until the diary unlocks and jars glow. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who, where, when). The only flaw: the hidden chamber’s discovery leans on artifact function rather than character-driven deduction, slightly softening causality at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)

    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the diary’s blank pages reveal stories only through empathetic listening, reweighting silence from absence to latent voice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via resonant objects, frequencies, and named silences until the fireworks climax crystallizes collective recognition. Cost is conceptual but legible: the world pauses, implying a shift in social attunement. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single-scene structure fits scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (doodles, scent, hush) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: serenity is redefined as motion-in-stillness. Closure lands with resonant reconfiguration—village adopts the custom—but the cost is oblique, not felt on the page. No path is foreclosed; Lira succeeds without loss, weakening Earned Stasis. Orientation is clear early, and pattern is taught by ~25%.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: resilience is redefined as rhythmic cultural practice, not just an object. The inverted-hour constraint creates a live clock that tightens decisions, and Mira’s final act—releasing the tip into the basin—forecloses personal gain for planetary renewal with visible cost (sacrificing cargo). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: echoes, water flow, and inversion build toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 30; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vortex releases, the town’s hum returns, and Mara’s final act—pocketing the patch—crystallizes her role as guide. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind patterns densify into a vector, culminating in a cadence shift from silence to murmur. Cost is legible in the “weight of responsibility” and the irreversible act of triggering release. Orientation is anchored immediately (“port city,” “Mara,” “after the storm”), and causality flows via observed data → convergence → action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through auroral hues, sound-as-color, and the recurring “sculpted hush.” Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence is now “enriched with color and promise,” a Charged Poise that reweights stillness as active archive. Cost is conceptual—beauty persists only if remembered—but it’s legible in the final image of the pulsing sheet. Orientation is clear by line 3; the pattern is taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: guardianship redefined through failure’s lessons, crystallized when Mara steps back with new purpose. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring motifs (hush, flute, driftwood) until the seam opens and reseals with thematic resonance. Cost is legible in the relinquishing of old dogma and the silent offering that satisfies the fissure. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (vanishing stars, topaz glow, borrowed voices) until the halo’s crack releases a “dazzling proof.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: emotion as a transposed function, validated by the cascade of light. Cost is legible—the irreversible shattering of the fragment—and the pattern is taught early (“borrowed personalities,” “deliberate ambiguity”) and paid off cohesively at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ridgeway transforms from path to pilgrimage site, reweighting the premise that “brief encounters germinate myth.” Cost is legible in the courier’s solitude and the mentor’s permanent absence—felt through legacy rather than action. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each encounter deepens the pendant’s resonance without causal dependency. Orientation is immediate (“aurora-lit ridgeway,” “jittery relic courier”), and the mosaic-like structure (three encounters) is taught by the 25% mark with coherent transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with sensory and emotional density intensifying toward a Conceptual Repricing: objects absorb and radiate emotion. Closure lands decisively—the prism glows as a “beacon,” Liora walks away carrying shared sorrow, and the “shifted hush” becomes a chorus. Cost is legible: the world can no longer pretend feelings are locked away. The engine sputtering to life ties cause to resonance without violating causality, satisfying all closure criteria with lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara’s sacrifice becomes the warp binding worlds, with visible cost in the spent amber glow. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—each puzzle click deepens silence into sound, culminating in the filament’s resonance. Orientation is immediate (“forgotten orchard… bamboo forest”), and causality flows through poetic logic without breaks. The final hum of hope reconfigures time’s hush with irreversible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the blacksmith endures past failure to forge renewal, with visible cost (sacrificed memory) and resonant reconfiguration (crystal vines from struck stone). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring azure motifs that culminate in the blade’s song. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. One flaw: the mine’s opening feels minimally motivated beyond magic compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis inverted into release) with conceptual cost: the truth’s liberation shatters stasis and dissolves the shard. The Causal lens holds—each action follows from prior cause (shard use → log reveal → unmaking). Orientation is immediate (“abandoned spaceport repair bay,” “my name is Lira”), and the single transition (stepping through the seam) is legible. Cost is visible: the green shard fractures irreversibly, and the crew’s awakening alters reality permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marek’s ritual redefines the lighthouse as emotional sanctuary, with visible cost—the lamp dies, yet hope persists via the stone spiral. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through repeated stone placements, culminating in a pulse of collective memory. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3. The final image (“sea glass...glowed faintly”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost: safety is fragile, portable, and communal.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring luminous motifs until the prism refracts meaning itself. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy reweights reality—“the world would not end, but would be reborn in shadowed brilliance”—with felt cost in the dissolving newspaper and erased tides. The ritual’s timing (“after the last print newspaper”) grounds the mythic in historical rupture. Every image tightens toward the final vow, making the before/after legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (sun trails, morpho wing, tea steam) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the realization that beauty bearing warning attracts stories. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“floating rock tea house,” “dye master Lira”), and the closure lands with conceptual cost—the acceptance of a guardian role that binds her to vigilance. The loom activation and final ascent crystallize a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured: she must now illuminate, not merely observe. No causality breaks; every image feeds the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pressure builds through sensory density and lyrical cadence rather than causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Eli’s act of unspooling dream-threads transforms quantified sorrow into measurable peace, foreclosing the labyrinth’s era of echoing grief. Cost is visible in the dissolution of every filament—a surrender of stored pain—and crystallized in the tower’s inhalation. The moonlit setting, sextant, and oak all cohere to charge this final image without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with density increasing through prismatic light, hums, and memory fragments until the night softens into dawn—a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: the surrender of endless night. Orientation is immediate and vivid (“mirror world,” “alchemical orchard greenhouse”), and the closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s final whisper forecloses silence permanently. The woven dawns reconfigure the realm’s very physics, and the cost (the thinning of night, release of constellations) is legible in every closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis through reintegration—carrying grief into the world without abandoning sanctuary. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with paradoxes, silence, and nested riddles deepening until the blank book’s mirror delivers conceptual repricing with felt cost. The crumpled invitation’s transformation into a glowing token proves the paradox resolved, and the final image of cobblestones under “early dawn” reweights the entire nocturnal journey. Orientation is clear by line 3, and causality remains intact within the lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis crystallized in the quiet act of sharing bread with absence, reweighting the palace’s decay into sanctity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via recurring motifs (vines, crust, steam) until the final image reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost: absolution is fragile, shared, and transient. Orientation is clear by line 3; the loaf’s discovery functions as inciting incident, and the tea house ritual deepens pressure without false causality. Cost is legible in the “tenuous absolution” that rests on fragility, not grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chief’s act reweights silence into testimony, with cost legible in “weight of each vow” settling as a map, not burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via frequency shifts, culminating in a resonant pulse synced to her heartbeat. Orientation is immediate (“frozen library above clouds… records chief”), and the single scene tightens coherently toward earned stasis. Final line (“memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion”) crystallizes the before/after without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila preserves the truce until sunrise, foreclosing immediate violence at the cost of future conflict (“each victory carried the seed of future conflict”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory detail and recurring motifs (watch fob, false starts, comforting unease) intensifies toward a Charged Poise ending. Cost is legible in the wind’s sigh and extinguished lanterns. No causality breaks; orientation anchors firmly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering and ritualized actions until the convergence crystallizes meaning. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing: Arin reweights his understanding of “weather” from external phenomenon to embodied planetary attunement, with cost legible in his surrendered skepticism. The forest election mechanic functions cohesively as both world rule and narrative clock. Every image—from spores altering humidity to the aurora’s fade—feeds the final reconfiguration without causal overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery until the auroral sorrow culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s creative block dissolves as the locker opens and ink flows. Orientation is clear by line 3 (who: Lena; where: crystal cave; when: post-laughter silence). Closure lands with conceptual cost—the “fractured inspiration” mended but not erased—and the vial’s emergence reweights the entire premise without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: candor reweights reality itself, pushing back the toxic sky. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of truthful acts intensifies until the vent surges. Cost is legible in the grayed plate and dried basins; the final image shows vines “singing,” proving change. Orientation anchors immediately (“greenhouse city,” “gilded-leaf calligrapher”), and causality flows through object-behavior feedback loops.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (glisten, hum, silence) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: silence itself becomes language. Closure lands via Charged Poise—the final image of the kinetic sculpture’s “slow heartbeat” reconfigures meaning, making wonder legible against fading. Cost is felt in the seasonal muteness, the neighbors’ shared vigil, the gulls’ hush—all evidence of a world sacrificing noise for resonance. Orientation is immediate (“edge of the world,” “lone workshop”), and the pattern is taught by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vira achieves calm not by erasing fear but integrating it, with visible cost—the dissolution of perpetual vigilance. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, built through escalating sensory and symbolic density (heat, magnetic shift, breathing wood, compressed fears) that culminates in the roses as compasses. Causality is maintained via motivated ellipsis: magnetic shift → shielding flicker → irrigation chaos → box activation → controlled burn. The final image reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost: peace requires containing, not eliminating, chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory and narrative density builds until the locket’s melody unlocks community memory. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing—the mailbox mystery is solved not by force but by listening—and the final image (the boy hearing his grandfather’s echo) reweights the premise with emotional cost. However, causality falters slightly: the old storyteller appears without setup, functioning as deus ex machina. The pattern is taught early (mailbox as game, whispers), but the resolution relies on convenient lore rather than Mara’s active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (dice, journal, tide) until the lab “learns to breathe.” Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration: the lab rises, Selene steps out, and the dice become silent witnesses—charged poise with conceptual cost (secrets released, vulnerability archived). However, the inciting pressure (ocean above, secrets below) never tightens into a concrete dilemma with narrowed options; escalation is lyrical, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (wildflowers, spirals, gravity pockets) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: deleted memories are compressed into gravitational anomalies. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the whale’s song returns only as reclaimed fragments—and the salt chamber’s stabilization signals irreversible change. Orientation is clear by line 3; the drive lens holds coherently from first to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis achieved by sealing the prophecy within the crane’s wing, foreclosing its revelation with conceptual cost (the world remains unaware, peace preserved at the price of hidden knowledge). The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—silence deepens through layered imagery until it crystallizes into a lattice of calm. Every beat builds density toward the final hush, and the brook’s transformation into a “river of stars” reweights prior motifs. No causality breaks; the ritual’s logic is internal and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the seal’s sigil redefines “lies” as protective bridges toward truth, with the borrowed sugar ritual embodying that pact. The meteor shower intensifies pressure texturally, not causally, aligning with an Accumulative/Textural lens taught early (“falling fire… painted silver streaks”). Cost is legible in the narrator’s abandoned interrogation and embrace of ambiguity—foreclosing scholarly detachment for intimate listening. Orientation is immediate (“rooftop garden,” “dead language tutor”), and the single scene deepens coherently to Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure—a Conceptual Repricing via symbolic alchemy—lacks legible cost. No path is foreclosed; Lira walks away unburdened, with the archive becoming a “living library,” negating stakes. The Orientation Test passes early, but pressure never tightens: the star’s fading is atmospheric, not tactical. Final image reweights nothing—it affirms a thesis already stated.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with escalating density of image and motif culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s Earned Stasis—choosing balm over blade—forecloses vengeance with felt cost (the melted key, the lifted weight). Orientation is immediate (“marble sanctuary under aurora”), and closure lands with conceptual and emotional cost: the forged verses become forgiveness, not weapon. The drip-as-metronome pattern tightens meaning without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: echoes are living memories seeking release, reweighting the entire premise with poignant cost. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout—each layer of memory deepens the central question without causal breaks. Orientation is immediate (“beneath a serpentine nexus under starlight”), and the lattice projection crystallizes the before/after shift. The pristine shell’s appearance feels inevitable, not convenient, because the seashell half’s resonance has been consistently dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the melted globe becomes a beacon reweighting “wreckage” as a vessel of collective hope, with conceptual cost in the labor of dream-weaving. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via recurring dream fragments until the lattice sharpens into a window. Orientation is immediate (“frozen cliff,” “lantern,” “shrine”), and causality flows through pattern recognition, not brute force. The final image (sunrise after starlight solidified in veins) makes the before/after legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (fireflies, moon paths, whisk) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: hidden patterns are the scaffolding of existence. Orientation is clear by line 30—single POV, parapet after rain, firefly season. However, closure lacks a decisive felt cost; the philosopher’s ritual is repeated, not transformed, and no path is foreclosed. The final image resonates but doesn’t reconfigure stakes with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens: sensory fragments coalesce into a map, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure—the “stillpoint” is redefined as mental clarity, not physical location. Cost is legible in the corporation’s buried truth and Mira’s responsibility to protect it. Orientation is solid by line 30 (who: Mira; where: irradiated orchard; when: post-liquidation). The closure lands with resonant reconfiguration and conceptual cost: myth becomes measurable reality, but stewardship replaces exploitation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the stormlit observatory becomes a lighthouse where “variant allegiance” redefines hope through reclaimed shadows, with the aurora sunrise signaling irreversible change. However, causality is accumulative/textural rather than causal—events unfold through atmospheric intensification, not because/therefore linkages. The lens holds (Accumulative/Textural), and cost is legible in the visionary’s lifelong solitude crystallizing into earned stasis. Minor deduction for reliance on lyric resonance over dramatized turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered sounds and recurring images. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration: the loft becomes a “chapel of resonance” and the poet’s role solidifies into shared purpose. Cost is subtly felt—the weight of centuries lifting—but never concretely dramatized as a trade-off. The pattern is taught early (music box → jars → child), and the ending reweights the premise without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: cadence, sensory density, and resonant repetition build to a Charged Poise closure where Elara’s calibrated cradle reconfigures the crystal’s power from weapon to healer. Cost is legible in her tear—a logical acknowledgment of beauty forged—and the crypt keeper’s key’s retirement signals fulfilled purpose. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30. The vault’s unlocking via vibrational harmony feels earned, not coincidental, and the final image merges lighthouse beam and crystal hum into a symphony of protection.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara’s restless yearning is unyoked, foreclosing the path of impatience with felt cost—the surrender of urgency. The moon-path tracking, magnetic pulse, and viaduct hum build density that reweights the stake of waiting, culminating in the ice’s “release” crack as physicalized cost. Orientation is clear by line 3 (“basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake… Elara”), and the pattern of lunar/magnetic observation tightens meaningfully at the apex. The final image—wind singing softer—confirms a world altered by her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building resonance through layered imagery (water, light, memory). Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the valve turn redirects water and symbolically severs bureaucratic control, with the tunnel’s “lullaby” implying earned stasis. Yet the causal link between empirical observation and discovery of the hidden pipe feels asserted, not dramatized—data notes humidity surges when the flame flickers, but this leap to an ancient conduit lacks intermediate beats. Cost is felt (“collective gratitude”) but remains conceptual, not personal or material.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the heart beats, symbolizing hope renewed, with conceptual cost embedded in the chaplain’s promise and the repaired mechanism. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring motifs (light, ticking, hush) that culminate in the sunlit heartbeat. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is maintained via deliberate micro-choices (winding, inserting the rod). The cost—moral and mechanical labor—is legible in the amber-lit silence before ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs (kaleidoscope, bell, gears) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: the act of ringing an unheard bell redefines meaning itself. Orientation is immediate (“cart glider… hovered over the hissing acid sea”), and closure lands with conceptual cost—the algorithm logs a vibration no ear can catch, yet it satisfies a cosmic yearning. The final image reweights all prior chaos into purposeful absurdity, fulfilling Charged Poise with undeniable resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the archive transforms from static repository to living echo chamber, with cost legible in Lia’s newfound burden (“vowed to guard the archive’s hidden corridors”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the recurring numbers pattern deepens into a key, and density increases until files resurrect. The inciting discovery (hoodie patch) and climax (vault opening) are causally linked through metadata sleuthing. One flaw: the algorithm’s sentient-like response borders on unearned coincidence, slightly softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the world “breathes in unison” once empathy is mapped onto action, reweighting the premise that anomalies become ordinary through shared understanding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through reflective mirrors, rhythmic breaths, and layered images—culminating in a charged final image with conceptual cost (the surrender of solitary courage for communal warmth). Orientation is immediate and vivid; causality flows via pattern intensification rather than linear cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “fold in patience” reweights from crack to gentle bend, transforming the premise of seeking death into listening for solace. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of ice, wind, lace, and wreckage builds to a cadence shift at the moonlit parasol moment. Cost is legible: the relinquishing of active death-seeking for receptive witnessing, crystallized in “hopeful hands.” Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (amber light, charred paper, vines) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: love’s endurance as compost for future growth. Closure lands via Earned Stasis—the sentinel accepts his role as bridge between fire and earth—with conceptual cost (abandoning personal romance for stewardship). However, causality falters: the vines “answer” anthropomorphically without prior groundwork, and the letter’s “glow” borders on magical realism unearned by established rules. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), but pressure escalates through lyric accumulation, not narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the desert itself records and redistributes wisdom, reweighting the premise that sanctuary is spatial rather than perceptual. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory-poetic detail intensifies until the parapet’s shimmer crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the villagers’ transformed understanding and the dunes reshaping into his footsteps. No causality breaks; orientation is clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: lavender, rust, photographs, and feather accrue symbolic weight until the final constellation image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the assembled arcs pulse with collective heartbeat, and healing begins—but cost is conceptual, not felt. No path is foreclosed; Mara simply continues her work, diluting stakes. The structure is coherent, though the “tangled web” never tightens into true narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: language’s growth is reweighted as a living pulse, not lexical data, with conceptual cost (the printed dictionary’s obsolescence). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density builds via light, sound, and notation until the crystal’s memory coheres. The folded page and dimming glow crystallize Charged Poise: options are legible, stakes reconfigured. Orientation is immediate and sustained; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophet accepts that capturing aging means letting it ripple outward, crystallizing in the slab inscription—a Charged Poise where cost (inevitable forgetting) is felt but transformed. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with fog, chalk, and driftwood accruing meaning toward the final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality remains intact despite lyric design. The cost—futility turned into ritual—is legible in “even if the tape never played, the act itself was a promise.”

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock hand’s spin is not stopped but redirected, transforming chaos into steady power—a Charged Poise where time’s relentlessness is coaxed into purpose. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds throughout, with escalating density of luminous ache, leaf echoes, and gear synchronicity culminating in a cadence shift at repair. Cost is legible in the “weight of centuries” lifting and the observatory’s breath—felt sacrifice embedded in atmosphere. Orientation anchors (“sage camera repairer,” “lunar observatory,” “foundations shake”) are clear by line 30, avoiding disorientation penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring sensory motifs (vinyl, scent of hope, pulsing stillness) that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing: brokenness as wholeness. Orientation is clear by line 30 (who: Mara; where: hospice above clouds; when: after blood work). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final chord, shared breath, and staff taking vinyl shards reconfigure death as transformation. Cost is legible: Mara’s emotional labor and the irreversible loss of Mr. Harlan.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lira learns shadows are entities migrating to the isle’s core, reweighting light/absence into a cosmology of hidden rest. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the spiral of runes, rhythmic pulses, and layered sensory detail intensify until the final chime crystallizes revelation. Cost is legible in the island’s “settling” and the key winding down, implying expended energy. Orientation is immediate (“floating isle,” “nocturnal observatory,” “Lira”), and causality flows through repeated ritual tightening to earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the cleft becomes a “gateway,” reweighting certainty itself, with felt cost in the hollow corpse and Mara’s lingering doubt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring motifs (tooth, vertebrae, constellations), culminating in a cadence shift at the final breath of the garden. Orientation is clear by line 3, and the single scene adheres to scope defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she accepts earthbound purpose, crystallizing identity as “quiet keeper of luminous peace.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image (glass, mist, pearl) intensifies toward a resonant final spiral. Cost is felt conceptually: trading celestial longing for grounded stewardship, implied in “anchored to earth.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern accrual (drip → stones → moss → code → fireflies). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the data center’s digital scars become “gentle lullabies,” reweighting loss as preserved knowledge. Cost is legible in Lira’s “protected vulnerability,” absorbed by the garden as new growth. The drip pattern teaches early, pays off at closure, and anchors orientation cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring motifs (cameos, mist, shell) until the final image reweights hope as constellations on paper—a valid Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear by line 3: who (novelist), where (feral nexus in mist), when (inside closing pages). The closure lands with legible conceptual cost—the binding of ephemeral hopes forecloses their freedom—but the “decisive change” hinges on metaphor rather than dramatized consequence. No causality breaks, though escalation relies more on lyrical intensification than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Earned Stasis via Mara’s vow to guard the rites, crystallized in the forest’s rustling “like pages… sealing her vow.” Cost is legible—the burden of stewardship, implied by “protect the valley” and “teach those who listened.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through sensory and melodic layering until the golden halo triggers the pollen cascade. Orientation is immediate (“edge of the ancient forest… at dawn”), and causality flows through ritual logic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she commits to seasonal return, binding herself to the orchard with visible cost (eternal tending). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through pattern density (spirals, fragments, breaths) until starlight seals the plate in a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible: “the seal would hold only as long as she continued to tend.” Orientation is immediate (“withered orchard… subarctic crater”), and the final image crystallizes stakes without over-explaining.
