  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as dust patterns gradually transform the greenhouse and Elena's perspective, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts rather than resists entropy. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the butterfly dust accumulation creates coherent pressure toward Elena's shifted stance, though the cost could be more visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with frost patterns gradually revealing the grandmother's legacy, culminating in discovery of pigments and transformation of understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reframes her family's smuggling past as artistic resilience, with emotional cost evident in tears and the scorched testament's new meaning. The causality holds but relies heavily on symbolic coincidence (frost patterns matching ledger routes).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the climactic restoration of sound. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when silence transforms into "music born from emotion's heat," with visible cost in Elara's tears and the emotional mapping process. The worldbuilding of the post-silence era anchors early and pays off through the heat-mapping solution, though the causality of how emotional heat translates to physical vibration strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through ghostly manifestations building to the transformation sequence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the library transforms from "tomb of turmoil" to "serene repository," with Elias's exhaustion as visible cost. The orientation anchors (underwater city, library, Elias as undertaker) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from anonymous to declared action, with visible community transformation as cost is shared. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern builds through repeated midnight runs, bell symbolism, and generational imagery, culminating in the arbor gathering. However, the causality between sanctions tightening and youth unrest feels asserted rather than dramatized, weakening the pressure that forces Elias's declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagery building toward revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—the "unused love flooded out" without showing what Elara sacrifices or loses to achieve this. The breathing technique arrives late without setup, and the resolution feels too neat for the established wound.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: discovery → vision trap → geometric solution → disintegration/escape, with Elias's hedge maze expertise providing the key to escape. The closure shows a Decisive Change where Elias gains knowledge of time's texture but loses the fragment, with visible cost ("the fragment's loss, the fading echoes of pasts he could no longer grasp"). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the hyperbolic geometry concept arrives late without sufficient setup.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis - Elias successfully impedes the invaders through intellectual resistance, with visible cost in his chains and patient suffering. Causal linkage holds from cipher discovery through decoding to defense activation. The "green shoots piercing arid earth" provides resonant reconfiguration of the opening's "forgotten dreams."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through layered absences building to crystallize the sought sound, with clear cost in "tears welled as memories' impact washed over him anew." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias finds "release" through capturing what haunted him, though the precise nature of his forward path remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around moonlight imagery building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara abandons thievery. Closure lands with felt cost as she transforms from "capture" to "creation," though the mechanism (voices "not audible but felt") strains credibility slightly. Who/where/when anchored early and causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elias abandons the control room for the "melting dawn," his frozen heart now "pulsing with warmth." The accumulative lens holds through melting ice/thawing heart parallels and glass-sphere creation, with visible cost in abandoning his wife's pain while preserving her memory in glass.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves closure through a Decisive Change where Elias transforms his phobias into weapons and defeats Mara, with visible cost in his raw but harnessed fears. The causal chain from identity discovery to confrontation holds, though the middle section rushes through crucial revelations about Mara's scheme. The orientation anchors arrive late but eventually clarify; the lens reads as primarily Causal with successful because/therefore linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the sealed booklet preserving "retold silences within an eternal, ambered hush." The accumulative structure coheres as density increases toward the ending. Cost appears in the trembling fingers and the weight of completing the map as the last star fades, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the violin playing sequence that reweights Eko's understanding of thought origins. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Eko realizes "thoughts originated in the amalgamation of experiences," with the cost being the collapse of multiple timeline selves into one. Orientation anchors (robot janitor, frozen courtyard, post-procedure) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands clearly as both Elias and the visitor achieve mutual transparency, with the cost of vulnerability made visible through their shared projections. The accumulative structure coheres through the concert tickets → lens → revelation pattern. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the visitor's presence, though this serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's proven bond with the garden, with visible cost in Thorne's shattered confidence and the system's confusion. The causal chain from feigned surrender through secret healing to revelation holds well. Deducting for the somewhat mechanical resolution where the garden's "knowing" feels asserted rather than fully dramatized through specific, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: theory → device construction → experiment → proof with dangerous consequence → reversal. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—they pull back from the discovery's danger, foreclosing the path with visible cost (the temporal eddy threat). The "profound shift" in Elara is asserted rather than dramatized through specific change, weakening the closure's felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through water damage revealing hidden patterns, discord disrupting silence, and spectral approval building to closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly as Elias completes the "wordless conversation" and exits "transformed," with the cost visible in the deliberate violation of musical sanctity ("deliberate discord...screech that echoed through the rafters"). Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3, and the single-scene structure maintains coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with botanical illustration serving as the focal accumulation point. However, the closure—Elara exhaling "lighter now"—lacks visible cost beyond abstract "auroral sorrow of lost years." The revelation about witnessing her brother's sabotage feels unearned without dramatized flashback or present-tense consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) with Alex's exploration leading to spectral encounter and eventual clarity about his father. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where turning the valve releases both water and psychological burden. The cost is felt but somewhat abstract—"the burden he'd carried" lacks the visceral specificity needed for higher scores. Orientation is clear early with setting and character established within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the keeper's cyclical return reinforces his eternal vigil with the cost of "crumbling peace." The accumulative/textural lens holds as seasonal drift and regenerative silence build toward this resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4, and the cryptic folds create a coherent portal mechanism. Deducting for cost visibility—while "crumbling peace" is named, the specific price of endless observation could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Finn's transformation during the eclipse, with the baby hair curl creating a tangible link between loss and renewal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the eclipse moment. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we're told Finn carries "a spark of lifelong wonder" but don't see what specific path this forecloses or what price he pays for this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently from physical discovery to conceptual revelation about the displaced axis and lost dreams. The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where finding the tapestry fragment reweights the possibility of restoring dreams. The cost is primarily conceptual—the weight of a world without dreams—though the emotional price could be more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure where multiple revelations cascade into community transformation. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (mayor's trembling relief, fisherman's reconciliation). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. Slight weakness in the too-tidy resolution where all fortunes work perfectly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the entity's dissolution through silence-as-strength reverses its core assumption with visible cost (dimensional anchor stabilizing, shadow dissipating). The accumulative structure coheres through loop-building toward this crystallized moment. Orientation anchors clearly (priest, chapel, dimensional nexus) and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through memory-mapping to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from being pulled backward to conducting forward. The closure lands with felt cost—his exhaustion and the sacrifice of his chronological comfort—while the mirrored horizon becoming a pivot point where "past and future could converge" charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens: The story builds through recursive timeline explorations, each adding density to Elara's understanding until the final revelation triggers her transformation from gravity-defier to mortal. The closure lands with clear cost (losing immortality/power for freedom). The "between drop and ripple" constraint effectively tightens pressure, though the multiple timeline iterations feel rushed rather than deeply explored.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias finding "purpose renewed" and breaking numbness via shared silence, with visible cost in tears and emotional release. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through reversed songs creating the "filament of hush." Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with layered details building toward Earned Stasis—Elias's refusal to engage forecloses connection with visible cost. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. However, the cost of his choice remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts grief's necessity, with visible cost in his sobbing breakdown. The closure lands with "ready to broker lanterns infused with this newfound peace," showing transformation through acceptance. Orientation anchors clearly (greenhouse, Elias, night), and the textural accumulation of scent memories creates earned catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise at closure when Elias "chose neither fully" and vanishes "forever chasing time's weave," crystallizing his options with felt cost. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on backstory (the prison escape) without sufficient present-frame pressure until the grotto scene, and the energy beings' arrival setup consumes early space without advancing immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the violinist frees the bowl's bound echoes, transforming the chronic hush into a "world reborn in whispers." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and imagery build toward this release. Cost is visible in the breaking of silence and acceptance of eternal incompletion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the ritual's progression toward Elara's transformation into "something ethereal, a guardian of balanced feelings." This Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—the subsiding of her former trade and identity. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 2, and causality holds as each ritual step builds toward the metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers encounters (symphony→library→envelope→meeting) building toward a resonant reconfiguration where two people commit to continuing cycles of compassion. The closure lands with Elias's promise to fund an exhibit (visible cost) and their bond forming. However, the coincidental nature of the mistaken address and immediate deep connection weakens causality, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the search and discovery sequence, culminating in Lirah's acceptance via the obsidian arbor dedication (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the cost remains largely abstract—"glowing pain of belonging" doesn't translate to visible sacrifice or foreclosed options. The search-to-integration arc coheres but lacks the decisive tightening that would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara frees the echo-bird, resolving the interrupted cadence while creating new interruptions to extend the giant's nap. The causal chain from discovering time-sculpting to using it as a key works, though the cost of "borrowing time" remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the vision of Mira "stepping through a veil" that reweights the ambiguous loss with possibility rather than finality. The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through ritual detail and memory. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"knowing his invention had bridged the unbridgeable" lacks the visceral price that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the tape fragment triggering cascading sense memories that culminate in Elias's materialization—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (surrendering decades of chosen invisibility). The closure lands with felt weight as he trades his hidden existence for connection. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, Elias) establish by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the transformation building through sensory details ("tingling in fingers," "greenish hue," "leaf veins on her arms"). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes a hybrid being, with clear cost—losing human form to gain deeper understanding. The linden leaf catalyst and storm pressure create coherent causality, though the transformation mechanics could be more precise.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the exchange—Elias trades the brooch for stories, transforming his isolated artistic practice into collaborative meaning-making. The accumulative lens holds as rain trails lead to convergence, then human connection. Cost is visible in letting go of the family heirloom. The coincidence of Mira's arrival and brooch recognition weakens causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's transformation from rigid clairvoyant to conduit of "steadily unpredictable" magic, with cost visible in her lost foresight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as musical harmonies and overlapping shadows build density toward the pearl's discovery and subsequent inhabitation. However, the transformation sequence from pearl-touch to full inhabitation lacks intermediate resistance or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara gathering fragments through "staggered intervals" to rebuild community hope. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the exiles transform from doubt to collective rebuilding, with visible cost in "the void of our banishment." However, the accumulation happens largely through summary ("Through days that blurred into a rhythm") rather than dramatized beats, limiting the closure's full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change (Elias confronts family truth and transforms), with visible cost ("bad habits shatter, replaced by new starts"). The causal chain holds throughout, though the final transformation happens too quickly without sufficient on-page struggle. The mystical elements strain plausibility but remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms entangled memories into "distinct yet connected" states, with emotional cost visible in her confrontation with guilt. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the transcription sequence. Orientation is clear early (tower, whale migration, twilight). The cost—releasing confusion but keeping connection—lands concretely in "no longer a burdensome tangle."

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the breach attempt. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elowen gains knowledge of the "after-goodbye" but remains trapped, creating Earned Stasis. However, the cost feels muted; "boredom tempered by knowledge" lacks the visceral price needed for higher scores, and the orientation takes too long to establish the prismatic escondite's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovering the ink pot through breaching the asylum system, with clear closure as Alex balances father's debts through calculated action. The final "scales finally even" delivers closure with visible cost (risk of detection, moral compromise). Slight weakness in the magical realism element (ink that "liquefied rigid thinking") which strains plausibility without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes its accumulative structure through layered descriptions of Elias's texture-collecting ritual, building toward a Conceptual Repricing where he realizes the town's silence is deliberate containment. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual ("His motivation sharpened") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The warning texture from the explorer's journal provides the turn, but the final beat doesn't fully dramatize the weight of this discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, with collected story fragments building toward the survivor's self-reconstruction through the poison bottle discovery. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the survivor transforms from void to "textured" existence. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract final lines that tell rather than embody the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elias reframes life's riddle from seeking permanence to embracing ephemerality. The accumulative structure builds through observatory details, seashell discovery, and cello resonance, with cost visible in the fading compass and abandoned space, though the final insight could land with more dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through community reorganization, but the cost remains abstract—we don't see specific losses or sacrifices made by individuals. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks a decisive moment where Lanara pays a personal price. The corporate envoy's arrival and the crowd's response feel convenient rather than causally earned through the graffiti campaign's specific mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from crater discovery through vigil to the grain's dissolution. The closure - photographing the grain's vanishing glow - lands with felt cost as Elena preserves what cannot be saved. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from problem (broken drone) through unique solution (sound-based diagnosis via water refraction) to resolution with visible cost (the ship's dependency on this fragile guide). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias returns to waiting, having enabled another's journey he cannot take—though the emotional cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes clear orientation and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward discovery. However, it lacks true closure on the page - Elias begins his journey but never reaches the singular convergence or pays a visible cost. The ending shows him "pressing on" rather than achieving the Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revival through rhythm, but closure lacks visible cost—the town revives without sacrifice or trade-off being dramatized. The transformation happens but feels unearned; Thorne simply leaves after success without any price paid for breaking the "great discord."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's successful capture of the ephemeral essence, with clear cost (likely death from oxygen depletion). The accumulative structure coheres as pressure builds through dwindling oxygen, thickening water, and intensifying alarms, though the abstract nature of "unsnarling the hush" slightly obscures the mechanical clarity of the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) as Elias completes his confession and finds peace, with visible cost in confronting his father's legacy. The accumulative/textural lens holds as copperlight imagery and the hush motif build toward the final calm. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality tracks cleanly. The cost could be more visceral at the closure moment—"his repose remained, an impossible calm sustained within" tells rather than embodies the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant awakenings building through ephemeral visits toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "debts honored and souls entwined" transforms the greenhouse and fields. Cost is visible in Elias's depleted strength ("her visits sapped his strength") and the permanent loss of the bride, though the final transformation feels slightly unearned given the pattern of brief appearances.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through repeated sleepwalking sessions that transform the labyrinth. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara awakens to find positive changes without experiencing sacrifice or trade-off. The discovery of the illustration plate initiates change but the resolution feels unearned when transformation happens through unconscious action rather than deliberate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around the excavation, but closure lacks visible cost—faith "blooms" without sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The sundial assembly provides a symbolic resolution but doesn't create a true Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. Causality is present but mechanical: dig → find scrolls → read → faith restored, missing the pressure that would force stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a true closure with visible cost. While it ends with "The moment stretched, poignant and alive, just before the mailing," this is merely suspended action rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. No path is foreclosed, no price is paid, and the "before/after" remains illegible.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elara completes her warning chart but maintains her foolish facade, foreclosing direct action with visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the revelation of the high astronomer's betrayal. However, the cost remains more told than felt in the final image, and the who/where/when anchoring arrives late (past 120 words).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara confronts her unspoken apology and chooses vulnerability over isolation. The cost is legible in "the ache in her spirit" and her sob as she evokes the core wound. Orientation anchors (mangrove labyrinth, Elara, night) establish by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and emotional resonance build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena and Amir transform anxiety into "shared seeds." The coral fragment's journey from Elena to Amir and the decoded poem "Wounds grow roots, then flowers" create visible emotional cost. Slight deduction for predictable resolution arc.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from seeking lost joy to actively creating/sharing it through the network, with visible cost in "not in grand triumph, but in the quiet, joyful rediscovery." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered light-paintings until the final reweighting. Dream-logic remains internally consistent with clear who/where/when anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation from restorer to questioner, with the hobo nickel serving as catalyst for nested reality layers. The accumulative/textural lens holds as each awakening deepens her exchange of certainty for curiosity, culminating in her reply that reweights the opening question. Cost appears in her trading "rigid knowledge for endless inquiry," though the metaphysical nature makes the price more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through a Decisive Change where the gourd rattle disrupts surveillance and enables escape, with visible cost in the chaos and scattering. The causal lens holds as each beat follows because/therefore logic from greenhouse meeting to garden planting to drone confrontation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, though the worldbuilding concept of "taxable thoughts" carries more weight than character-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (reunion after centuries), but the cost remains largely abstract—"centuries of longing bloomed eternal" doesn't show what Elowen sacrifices or loses. The transformation from pain to beauty through half-sung lullabies lacks concrete causality, reading more as magical convenience than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the Heart of Names illuminates, making extinct emotions briefly audible again. The cost is palpable—Elara knows this preservation is temporary, and her own dreams remain unspoken. The piece teaches its lyrical pattern early and maintains coherence through the ethereal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elara's ritual causally restoring trust through the symphonies' revelation. The closure (reconciliation/trust restoration) lands on-page with emotional cost visible in "hearts aligned" despite "separate futures." However, the resolution feels slightly convenient—Thorne's instant acceptance after seeing the truth lacks the friction that would elevate the ending's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's harmonizing mechanism, with clear causal linkage from discovery to implementation. However, the closure's cost remains primarily conceptual—while the floodgates represent compromise, Elias himself pays no visible price, and the resolution feels too symmetrically satisfying ("traditionalists would see...opportunists their yields secured").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Elias's decision to share rather than hide (Decisive Change), with emotional cost visible in "tears bloomed." The accumulative lens holds as dust-mote mapping accumulates into trust-building. However, the friend's reply feels convenient and undercuts earned difficulty. Cost could be sharper—the reconciliation arrives too easily after months of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. Elias's final "readiness to bridge necessary distances" is abstract assertion without concrete change or foreclosed options. The piece reads as extended reflection on a past event rather than present-scene pressure forcing crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through shadowseam imagery to the synchronized breath creating belonging. Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara "forever attuned" to the deep, finding home through spectral communion. Cost is legible in the trade of surface world for abyssal belonging, though the emotional price could sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara examining seeds to understand vanished paths, but the closure lacks decisive change or meaningful cost—she simply "set it down, her heart lighter" without any path foreclosed or price paid. The orientation is clear but the ending offers only thematic summary ("turning loss into luminous stories") rather than an on-page reconfiguration with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric buildup toward the orchestrated performance. However, the closure lacks decisive change or meaningful cost—Elias simply pockets the bishop and plans the next performance, creating circularity without transformation. The "gift" to the crowd is asserted rather than felt, and no path is foreclosed with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation into a living monument—she seeks transcendence but becomes permanently anchored, with cost visible in her eternal binding to the garden. The accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual elements build toward the transformation. However, the mechanics of "observing gaps" remain somewhat abstract, and the nostalgia ban's enforcement lacks concrete threat, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's communion, moving from anxiety to acceptance with the cost being the imminent loss of the old ways. However, the closure lacks visible, dramatized cost—we're told he's "forever changed" but don't see how this changes his tactics or what specific path is foreclosed. The accumulative lens holds but the transformation remains too abstract: "carried the clear complexity of his insights" doesn't show concrete change.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eli's reflection serving as the primary movement, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where sharing pain creates connection. However, the cost remains abstract—Eli risks nothing tangible in opening the box or sharing his story, and Mia's tears don't constitute a decisive change. The orientation is clear (ridge path, night, two hikers) but the closure lacks visible stakes beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The accumulative structure builds through trial balloon releases and pattern arrangements, but the closure lacks visible cost—hope simply increases across timelines without Elara paying a price. The piece teaches its pattern of decorative intervention early, yet the final "serene disruption" reads as success without sacrifice. The orientation anchors (grotto, Elara, present action) land clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through echoes, diaries, and the film negative toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reframes her burden as "a shared narrative to rewrite." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—the line "the burden of her legacy lightened" tells rather than showing through embodied action or concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the painter creating mirages that eventually transform the mirrors. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when "the mirrors showed a world remade, possibilities unfolding like spring petals," though the cost remains more conceptual than felt—his impending dissolution is stated but not dramatized with visible consequence. The piece teaches its magical system early and maintains consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the ritual's completion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara sacrifices her vitality to anchor the peace treaty, with visible cost ("sharp pull within her chest," "eyes now dimmed"). However, the ritual mechanics feel convenient—summoning dead leaders who simply agree—and the piece lacks genuine complication or resistance that would deepen the earned quality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal closure where Elias's release of water constitutes a Decisive Change with clear cost - ruining profits and exposing schemes. The because/therefore chain from drought creation to redemptive flooding holds throughout. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (salt flat location clear, but temporal anchoring comes late with "distant thunder").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's harvest of echoes, which transforms the courtyard from enforced serenity to "a whirlwind of awakening." The cost is legible—she invites the court's wrath and shatters the protective conformity. Causality holds as her motivation drives each step toward the sanctuary, though the actual mechanics of the ritual feel underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias reverses his artistic practice from deception to truth-telling, with visible cost in losing Lena and abandoning profitable work. The causal chain from argument to reflection to new purpose holds, though the transformation happens entirely in reflection without present-scene testing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward the monarch's intervention that reweights Elias's understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias releases control, accepting "interrupted cadence" as profound truth rather than failure—cost visible in his loosened roots and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration where the rope's vibrations restore forgotten names. The closure lands with felt cost - Elara's tears and the weight of heritage preserved. Minor orientation wobble with the punched card's origin story slightly interrupting present momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Conceptual Repricing—Elara discovers paths choose walkers based on their readiness to "let directives decay and rebirth begin," reweighting her entire quest. Cost is visible as she transcends her limitation and the forest recognizes her transformation, though the dream sequence's causality could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical elements layering toward the portal opening and covenant sealing. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elias gains visions and eternal binding but no clear price is paid or path foreclosed. The orientation is clear (Babylonian palace, astronomer, twilight ritual) but the stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatized through concrete loss or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs as Thorne releases his resentment through cellular memory activation, with cost visible in his convulsions and the loss of his protective anger-shield. The sanctuary's reality-shifting provides persistent constraint throughout. Causality holds as Elara's intervention directly causes the transformation through the pin's properties. Minor orientation delay (sanctuary's nature revealed gradually) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias captures the runaway dream containing his wife's memory, with clear cost in the years of loss and the ritual's transformative demands. The accumulative structure builds through ritual preparation, breathing synchronization, and reality transformation, culminating in "the dream settled into his mirror, preserved forever." The orientation anchors (Elias, orchard district, twilight) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when the accidental spilling transforms into deliberate wisdom-sharing, with the quartz-infused ribbon symbolizing renewed vows. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details (apples, notebook, ribbon) layer meaning toward the final bridging moment. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—Elias's physical danger resolves too easily, and the emotional price of confronting grief through his daughter's poetry gets summarized rather than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias accepts his role as curator of "nonlinear threads," with clear cost ("forever chasing brightened disquiet"). The accumulative structure builds through bathroom revelation, mirror visions, and cameo activation toward this crystallized stance. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words, though the philosophical density occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: Thorne's arrival → quest for the Library → guardian confrontation → negotiation through found loophole → successful access. The closure lands with both achieving their goals (Thorne extracting knowledge, Elara absorbing harmonies), constituting a Decisive Change with visible transformation. The cost feels somewhat abstract ("unlearned lessons blooming within") rather than viscerally felt, and the resolution arrives too smoothly without genuine foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elara's narrative threads unite the twin voices, with visible cost in the "unified heart" transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories layer and alter throughout, building to the garden's revelation. Orientation anchors effectively despite the dreamlike setting. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution of the fog lifting exactly when the narrative completes.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to resolution. Closure lands as a Decisive Change where Elara successfully merges the absent histories with the seal, creating "enduring legacy" with the cost of the door's permanent vanishing. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from disrupted harmony through ice examination to the bloom's expansion, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when "hammered repose settled like forged armor." Cost is visible in the examination ritual and the bloom's contested emergence against the beings' storm. Orientation anchors early (harmonic caves, Elara as mapkeeper, after beings' arrival), and the pattern-taught method pays off at closure, though the energy beings' nature remains vague which slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear because/therefore linkages: vision reveals shard's importance → star tracking method discovered → shard located → beacon rekindled. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (bleeding hands, survivors drawn). The orientation is immediate and the lens holds throughout. Minor deduction for the convenience of the star-tracking method appearing exactly when needed.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the Archivist gathering fragments of collective memory through shadow measurements, building toward a Conceptual Repricing where she redefines her role. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"isolation's cost" is stated but not embodied. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, but the closure lacks the visible price or foreclosed path that would make the transformation legible as more than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increase through the fire-spinning sequence that reweights Elias's relationship to creation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he emerges "lighter" with renewed purpose, the cost visible in tears and the foreclosed path of despair. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early and the mosaic discovery provides meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Charged Poise closure lands when Elara accepts the jade cicada, crystallizing her transition with visible cost ("examining its details under the stars"). The accumulative structure coheres through pool imagery and cicada symbolism, though some middle passages drift into observation without pressure ("Kael's heart warmed with observation").

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with silences as collectible essences building toward freedom. The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms confinement "into a canvas for skyward dreams" with visible cost (risking the gravity inversion). However, the magical mechanics (gravity inversion, silence collection) strain credibility without sufficient grounding, and the resolution feels too neat for the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira learns silence as comfort through the storm glass demonstration and Elias's story, with visible cost in her surrendered urgency. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through prismatic imagery, vapor channels, and the storm glass's prophetic swirls, culminating in "the vaulting hush reigning supreme."

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (ruby flake → waterfall → orchard → paint peeling → throne), and closure occurs with Elara claiming the throne. However, the cost remains abstract ("merging her essence") without visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternatives. The piece teaches its world rules adequately but the final transformation to "renewed harmony" feels unearned without showing what Elara loses or surrenders.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's renewed isolation after teaching Lorin to breathe, with visible cost in the "loaded emptiness now lighter." The accumulative lens holds as shadow/threshold imagery builds toward this moment. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the piece maintains causality through the scar-linking mechanism. Deduction for the somewhat rushed resolution that could use more dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Elara's successful diamond transformation and sharing with fellow survivors (Decisive Change with visible cost). The causal lens holds as each beat follows because/therefore logic from mushroom farming to parallel messages to submarine dive. However, the quantum promise concept arrives late without sufficient setup, and the transformation mechanism feels somewhat convenient despite the cost being legible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elias's discovery driving the revelation sequence, and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he pockets the handle knowing "it would never turn again." The cost is visible in his father's sacrifice and Elias's acceptance of ending the dynasty. However, the mechanism of spectral voices emerging from standing waves strains causality, and the revelation arrives through passive reception rather than earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical density building toward Elandor's transformation into the orchard's guardian—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (unsnapping his gauntlet, binding himself). The closure lands cleanly with "No longer just a knight, he was the orchard's guardian," though the middle section's discovery-to-ritual progression could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's discovery reweights her own loss through historical parallel, with visible emotional cost paid. The accumulative structure coheres well through dust patterns leading to discovery. However, the parallel between button and apology note stretches slightly, and the final healing turn could use stronger causal grounding in the discovered story itself.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (raid leads to flight, puddle map leads to lagoon, broadcast failure leads to resourceful adjustment). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's broadcast succeeds but at the cost of exposure, with the seed of resistance taking root despite regime scrambling. The orientation is anchored early (librarian by day, rebel by night) and causality holds throughout, though the puddle-map discovery feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the "vested hush" successfully smothers the prophecy through accumulated musical negative spaces. The cost is legible in "the eerie nostalgia settling like dew on his soul" and the preservation of "fragile peace." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from seed-sorting through monument construction to spirit emergence, with the Leaf Whisperer's appearance serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The transformation "from spectral mist to a being of living vine and flower" lands with conceptual cost—Elara's orderly world becomes "chaotic joy." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (erratic clock ticks) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms his approach, incorporating the compass into a clock "by feel." The closure lands with visible change and implied cost (abandoning lifelong methods). Causality holds as coincidences guide discovery, though the greenhouse-to-waterfall progression feels slightly convenient without stronger forecasting.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through alchemical details until the final reconstruction lands as Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure occurs on-page when Elias recreates Aurora with kintsugi methods, accepting rather than erasing past failure—cost visible in "luminous regret softening to acceptance." Orientation anchors clearly (alchemist, foundry, post-storm), though the midpoint's expository density about zodiac properties slightly disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly as Thorne's soul dissolves into light after confession and laughter transform his guilt. The accumulative structure coheres through the harp's distorted notes building to spectral confession and release, with visible cost in Thorne's "centuries of wandering" and the friend's death. The piece teaches its metaphysical rules early and pays them off, though the transformation mechanism could be more causally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's trauma response building toward discovering the "mathematics of mercy." Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when she formulates forgiveness as an equation, with cost visible in her bodily trauma responses. However, the orientation remains murky past 120 words (unclear if the forest is real or metaphorical), and the mathematical formula feels unearned—arriving through assertion rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the three paintings revealing hidden histories. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the fragment releases voices "finally heard," though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias frees the ghosts by reversing the mainspring, with visible cost in "luminous wisps that ascended through the ceiling cracks." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as atmospheric details build toward this release. Orientation anchors clearly (circus, ticket office, Elias as technician), and the horologist's enchantment provides solid causality for the ghosts' binding.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: "content that eternity, though compressed, rustled eternally within him" crystallizes the transformed state with felt cost ("the library stabilized, albeit imperfectly"). The accumulative structure coheres through frost patterns → bottled whisper → rupture → compression, though the beloved's voice could be more concretely established early for stronger emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds "redemption for his own lost causes" through reimagining the ancient civilization. The visible time concept creates an intriguing frame, though its mechanics remain somewhat abstract. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("fragile victory amid the stars"), but the transformation from discovery to redemption feels slightly rushed in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: light returns and the covenant transforms from rust to renewal, with midnight's hold shattered. The causal chain holds—philosopher's stone enables truth-detection, tinkersong mends the covenant, restored covenant reclaims light. However, the cost remains abstract ("perpetual night") rather than showing specific, felt consequences of either the darkness or its lifting on Elias personally.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's discovery transforms her collection "forever altered" with visible cost (the dangerous solo descent, transformation risk). The accumulative structure builds through three hinged awakenings toward the lagoon discovery. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's artistic creation as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The magic lantern slide discovery at midpoint effectively tightens options and the sculpture-creation provides closure with visible artistic cost. However, the magical element introduction feels slightly convenient, and the final "promise of alliances yet to be forged" lacks the concrete cost required for 8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final understanding and creation of the mural, with emotional cost visible in her tears and transformation. The accumulative structure coheres through the postcards-to-glass-to-understanding arc. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract - we see tears but not what specific path or option is foreclosed by her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through diary discovery → retrocognitive trap → debris parley → truth revelation, with the obsidian lagoon serving as a resonant anchor. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias gains the buried evidence, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The "searing reverie" and "embers" create textural density that reweights the archival mission.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elias's rejection of the bottle leading to his mental reconstruction efforts, which then attract returning residents. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through collective rebuilding, with visible cost in the exhaustive mental effort. However, the mechanism by which "word spread somehow" weakens the causal chain at a crucial juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered memories and sensory detail building toward the prophecy's manifestation. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias's role transforms from passive archivist to active prophet, with visible cost in the structural changes to the building. The orientation is clear early, but the causal link between the immersion ritual and the prophecy's physical effects strains credibility without establishing the garden's supernatural properties beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and ritual elements build toward the vortex reopening—a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes inheritance "reopened and alive." Cost is legible through the visions of "lives unlived" and "moments borrowed from parallel fates." Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract final line that softens the otherwise concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through microclimate observations toward Earned Stasis—Elias's refusal to sound the alarm based on listening, with the cost being potential village devastation if wrong. The closure lands with "true warnings came not from ropes or sirens, but from the quiet art of attention," reweighting the entire premise with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's meditation on vulnerability building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she reconceives her janitorial role as guardianship. However, the closure lacks visible cost—her transformation occurs through pure realization without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately but the stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from wasteland establishment through discovery to resonant understanding, with the stained glass box serving as the pivot that reweights the covenant's meaning. The closure achieves Charged Poise as Elias crystallizes his purpose through Mira's ghostly presence, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than implied through "finding peace."

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries (capsule, urn fragment, coded flyers) that reweight time's meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara gains understanding of time's texture and extends her borrowed time, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the drake's imperfect healing, with clear cost in permanent scars and sparse feathers. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases from solitary wandering to mythic encounter to harmonized healing. The "kite string snaps" moment effectively marks the release point where accumulated harmony transforms into flight capability.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias methodically building his bridge between species, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The final wandering "content that his gently systematic work had unlocked a legacy" provides Earned Stasis but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The piece teaches its pattern but the ending summarizes accomplishment rather than dramatizing transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where converging pilgrims discover shared chemistry transcends artificial/real distinctions, with felt cost in their collective search for belonging. The accumulative lens holds as footprints multiply and pilgrims gather. However, the cost could be more visceral - it's conceptually present but emotionally muted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the dead reef transforms into a living garden, fulfilling the "submerged concord." The accumulative structure coheres well, building from arrival through ritual to transformation. Deduction for the cost being primarily ecological rather than personal to the protagonist; the Coachman pays no visible price for this renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Charged Poise at closure—Elara and Tracker step forward into uncertainty with crystallized options (pursue potentially illusory hope vs. remain). The cost is felt through "if these revelations were enough, or if the war's scars demanded more." However, the accumulative texture doesn't fully cohere; the riddle-solving feels more causal than textural, creating lens ambiguity that weakens the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovery transforms isolation into purpose, with visible cost (her outcast status). The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and pattern building. Slight weakness in the middle section's causality between sketching and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure—the piece swap triggers both the Archmage's transformation and sky's restoration, with visible cost in the corruption's thawing. The "who, where, when" anchors establish immediately. Minor deduction for the Archmage's convenient slumber during infiltration, though the resolution's causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Alex becomes "the historian of small gestures," with the illusory pawns flickering into being as visible transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as whispers and gestures build toward this crystallization. Cost appears in "fragmenting into wisps that carried freed gestures" but could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story delivers a clear Decisive Change as Elara moves from substituting reality to embracing truth and recovering her buried talent, with visible cost in the shattering of her mercury-glass orb. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds well through density increases and the feather's texture as catalyst. The closure lands with both personal transformation and broader mission, though the final "reshape what had been lost" feels slightly abstract compared to the concrete ritual preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Elias forgives himself as the curse breaks, showing visible cost in acknowledging his specific failure. The tapestry decoding accumulates pressure through pattern recognition leading to self-revelation. Slight deduction for the convenient timing of curse-breaking with self-forgiveness, though the causal link through "winnowing" truths maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance that "the price of forgiveness was the art of letting go." The accumulative structure coheres as her poetry sessions refract truth into multiple meanings. The cost is felt but could be more visceral—we understand conceptually but don't fully experience the weight of what she surrenders.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught kintsugi repair building to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elowen transforms uncertainty into conviction through the ritual. Each pockmark repair deepens both statue and self, with visible cost in held breath and acid threat. The closure lands cleanly with "uncertain alchemist had quilted his memories into eternity," though the exact nature of the workshop's stabilization could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with the mirror crack triggering Elias's journey to confront his past. The closure achieves a Decisive Change as he transforms from painting only the past to embracing the present, with emotional cost visible in his tears. However, the grotto's magical elements strain causality, and the "temporary eternity" concept remains abstract rather than dramatically enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the cork's purifying essence building toward Mira's return, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elias gains everything without sacrifice. The "I heard you" resolution feels unearned given the years-long separation and no explanation of survival mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the navigator accepts their patchwork nature while guiding others home. The accumulative structure coheres as moon phases intensify the compass's power, building from "faint whispers" to "roaring clarity." Cost is visible in the paradox of remaining fragmented to help others become whole. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay regarding the navigator's exact nature.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's ritual completion and the line "within her, a graceful fracture had mended just enough"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with psychological cost paid. The causality holds as foraging logic leads to ritual which leads to occlusion. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract ("budding calm," "psychological haven") rather than showing what specific capability or connection she sacrifices for this protection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered visions building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts guardianship of the fractured tale. The closure lands with felt cost as his isolation transforms into witnessed connection. The gap-observation method creates coherent pressure, though the visions could tighten causally—each revelation adds texture but doesn't always narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—Elias sees alternate lives with Clara, then emerges "renewed" with the promise transformed from burden to balm. The accumulative pattern of "as the creek rises" creates rhythmic pressure toward closure, and the cost is felt in his release from the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal drive lens with motivated quest structure leading to a Decisive Change when Elara discovers the council's deception. The closure lands with visible cost—she must "reclaim her throne from shadows" after learning the truth. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains causality throughout, though the ritual mechanism feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where friendship transforms to romance through alchemical metaphor. The portal journey and pocket-sun creation provide causal linkage, and Elara's return "changed" with "eyes alight" shows visible transformation with implied relational cost. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear anchoring (mountain cabin, chronicler with birch bark scroll) and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist transforms jealousy into creative fuel. The cost—accepting mortality's shadow while continuing to chronicle—is felt through "turning envy into elevation, chaos into clarity," though the transformation could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the water clock's repair paralleling emotional restoration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the screw bridges generations and losses. The closure lands with felt cost through both women's recognition of continuity amid grief. The orientation is clear by the second paragraph, and the screw's dual function as birthing tool and timekeeper creates meaningful linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where crystals shed and scars transform into "faint, narrative runes that glowed softly" with visible cost (the vulnerability of revisiting childhood trauma). The accumulative structure builds through ritual stages toward transformation. Orientation anchors (floating platform, tea ceremony, Elara) established early. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical progression through ritual stages.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "forgiveness glimpsed but not fully granted" with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure builds coherently toward this partial healing. However, the elaborate setup of induced currents and harmonic vibrations feels mechanically overwrought for what becomes essentially an emotional confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where illusions unravel and unity is revealed, with some cost implied in "wars of shadow dissolved." However, the accumulative texture relies heavily on abstract philosophical layering rather than concrete dramatization. The spiral structure coheres under the textural lens, but the cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Conceptual Repricing—Elias's understanding that clocks measure "the soul's horizon" fundamentally reweights his purpose at the station. The countdown sequence creates meaningful deepening as water reverses flow and reality bends, with each numbered memory building pressure toward revelation. Cost is conceptual but legible: his "peculiar vigil now infused with purpose" suggests the weight of this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's insight about permeable barriers transforms both the farm's defenses and her understanding of loss - "letting go was a force, not a void." The closure lands with felt emotional cost and conceptual repricing of her grief. Causality holds throughout, though the connection between the intrusion and her emotional breakthrough feels slightly engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure (Elara's vow to infuse classes with "real-world traversals") lands but lacks visible cost on the page - we're told about future intentions rather than witnessing present sacrifice. The accumulative structure coheres but the final "responsible rebellion" resolution feels too tidy, missing the mess of actual change.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when Elias realizes "he needed his own lesson" and considers emerging "above ground, in the light" - a decisive stance shift with implied cost (leaving his decades-long role). The accumulative structure coheres through the repeated wrong-number pattern building to this reversal. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient mechanism of the musician calling back directly to the booth.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the ritual's completion. However, the closure—Elias feeling Mira's presence after steeping her photo—lacks visible cost beyond what was already established (her death). The "regeneration" of their covenant happens through assertion ("feeling her hand brush his") rather than a decisive change with new stakes or genuine reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through rumor chains toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared stories replace isolation. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with "twilight of a world governed by polite anarchy." The closure lands with felt cost as Elias releases his defensive elusiveness, though the transformation's speed slightly strains credibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory density building toward the stillpoint's "language of peace," creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms to acceptance. Cost is felt through the emotional journey and time's pause, though the transformation lacks a sharper trade-off—Elara gains peace without visibly sacrificing his connection to Liran's memory.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: seeds create anomaly → anomaly enables pen's power → pen edits history. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible cost (crew evacuation, withered tendrils retroactively unplanted), though the mechanism of "editing history" strains credibility without more grounding in the established physics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms silence into music, with visible cost in years of "muted creativity" now reclaimed. Accumulative lens holds as silence patterns build toward musical breakthrough. Orientation anchors clearly (harbor, moonlight, Elias) though Thorne's sudden appearance lacks causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (relief→mosaic→portrait→tapestry) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from destroyer to guardian. Cost is visible in his tears and the weight of carrying Mira's lineage forward. The trail of artistic creations provides strong causality within the accumulative structure. Minor deduction for slightly convenient alignment of all clues.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's drumming building to a potential reconnection with Lir's essence. Closure achieves a Charged Poise where she questions whether the response is real or imagined, but the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we see tears and "auroral sorrow" but lack the specific, embodied price of this uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the challenge building pressure through contrasting navigation methods until Elias's whispered triumph lands with Marcus's defeated trudge as visible cost. The folded maps and zodiac coin create coherent constraints throughout. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient setup of the "chance encounter" and predictable outcome given the thematic deck-stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the guardian's light-weaving building toward Elara's confession. However, the closure lacks visible cost—we don't see what confession risks or what "making it right" will require. The transformation from silence to speech happens too smoothly without earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the synchronized window displays creating "newfound pauses" and "second thoughts branching into actions," with implied social cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered unspoken words toward the town-wide transformation. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—"minds of the free" suggests change but doesn't show specific prices paid or paths foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's call and disappearing island creating a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The transformation carries felt cost through Marek's loss, though the shift from human to creature needed stronger grounding earlier. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words in the sublittoral fringe setting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught theatrical narration building toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's "cultivated lightness" settling over her sorrow. The happiness mandate establishes stakes early, and Elias's method accumulates meaning through repetition. Cost is felt in the "moral weight of his ambiguity lingering" and Mira's transformation of grief, though the final beat could sharpen the price more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias communes with the colonnade, dissolving boundaries between realms with the "tremor of certainty" affirming his quest. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through sensory layering and pattern breaks (ban lifting, boundaries dissolving). Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"boundaries dissolve in awe" suggests transformation without concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: Elias arranges plants to barter → spirit accepts trade → colors overwhelm → Elias reverses the bargain. Closure lands as Earned Stasis when Elias renounces color vision with visible cost ("Horror gripped him"). Deduction for the spirit's unmotivated acceptance of the reversal which slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's pilgrimage building toward a Conceptual Repricing about connection. However, the cost remains abstract—"forever changed" without specific sacrifice or foreclosed path. The questioning of assumptions generates movement but doesn't create decisive pressure that narrows options. Orientation is clear but the closure lacks visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's departure with renewed purpose, but the cost remains abstract—we see transformation without witnessing what she sacrifices or risks. The accumulative texture builds well through the observatory's timeless quality and recurring motifs (origami, jewelry, veils), yet the final beat lacks the visceral price that would elevate this beyond mid-band execution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Marcus's confession building toward revelation of the measuring tape's significance. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara integrates the inherited tool into her practice, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors clearly by line 2, but the closure's "lighter step" resolution softens what should be a harder-edged reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where purified atoms allow the historian to embrace "the beautiful ache of what was," with felt emotional cost. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete dramatic beats, and the civilization's backstory remains vague exposition rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Elara's investigation through silent footage accumulates understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shadow transforms into a guardian with "luminous regret" lingering as felt cost. The closure lands with visible transformation on page: "the shadow bound itself to the river stone, becoming a guardian entity."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias processing betrayal through physical acts of clearing and reconstruction, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he emerges "resilient." The cost (lost innocence, hardened trust) is stated rather than viscerally felt on the page—"fragile convictions strengthening" tells us the change without showing the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost - Elara learns closure requires embracing rather than sealing wounds. The accumulative structure coheres through plant telepathy, coffee rings, and scar-reading, though the hourglass's "displaced miracle" mechanics remain vague. Who/where/when anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers love is "stored in the interstices of memory." The psychometry visions of Harlan provide causal linkage, and the final realization that her own unused loves are "similarly archived" creates clear before/after with emotional cost. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the closure's "symphony of the heart" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara achieves creative liberation through cosmic communion. While the closure lands with some emotional resonance ("forever changed"), the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. The piece teaches its lyrical pattern early but lacks the decisive tightening that would make the transformation feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformation of the archive's dormant timelines into blooming saplings, with visible cost in his "fractured lullaby" and endless vigil ahead. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from desolate beauty through archive discovery to active cultivation, though the "wave functions" mechanism remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the wind symphonies building to mental "unraveling" at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias laughing and crying as barriers crumble, showing emotional cost. The gear's discovery and systematic application through different tree sounds creates coherent pressure toward the final breakthrough. Minor deduction for the convenience of finding the exact tool needed without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elara boards the ferry to "traverse the veiled ridges of her own heart." The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by line 3, and the closure lands with felt cost through the "indirect routes of her journey." Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation and reliance on metaphorical rather than concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the bolt discovery that recontextualizes Elias's silence and connects past to present. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through his choice to remain and confront silence "head-on." However, the coincidence of Mira's arrival strains causality, and the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than philosophically stated ("true safety demanded the risk of sound").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with the rune of drift as organizing principle - messages accumulate to unmask Vesper with clear cost (his dissolution). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Vesper's false identity sunders. The lens holds consistently through cryptic accumulation toward revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through rhythmic tapping that builds to decode hidden coordinates and father's confession, with clear cost in confronting denial's legacy. The revelation lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—paths didn't vanish but submerged, reweighting all prior monitoring work. Orientation anchors clearly (Driftmoor Station, Pacific, post-ban era) and causality holds through pattern accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara activates the stone circle to reignite the rebellion. However, the transformation happens too easily—she presses stones and receives visions without meaningful obstacle or cost. The "thunderous roar of revival" lacks visible price; rebels simply respond to signals without showing what this renewal costs anyone.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara unseals the embryo, birthing "a tradition reborn" with clear cost to the old order. The accumulative structure builds through plant-whispers and decoded script toward this crystallized moment where "the child who would grow to lead their evolved ways" reweights the entire tradition-versus-progress conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis - Elias accepts his loss while choosing to tend life, with visible cost in the trembling hands and years of isolation. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the pearl moment, though the final paragraph slightly over-explains what the imagery already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases driving toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias embraces darkness to redesign reality. The closure lands with visible cost ("the luminescent ache lingered, a reminder that wholeness came at the cost of unraveling first"). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract connection between untangling tarot threads and mending reality—the causal mechanism could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure as Elowen discovers the neurological explanation for time dilation ("a neural surge, amplified by adrenaline"), but the cost remains largely intellectual rather than felt. The causal chain from sabotage to ink experiment to dimensional passage works mechanically but the revelation lacks visible price—Elowen emerges unchanged except for knowledge gained. Who/where/when anchors are clear by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: discovery leads to moral crisis leads to decisive action leads to societal upheaval. The closure lands with visible cost as Elara risks everything to expose corruption. The dormant networks discovery feels convenient but doesn't break causality since it emerges from legitimate exploration of the archives.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Elara's continued cultivation amid chaos forecloses her father's violent path with visible cost ("her father vanishing into the bounty hunts"). The accumulative lens holds as patterns of nurturing build toward "continuity threading through every thorn and bloom," though the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Eron's release of the echo, reframing possession into communion ("fulfilled not in possession, but in the fleeting communion"). The accumulative lens holds throughout with density increases and pattern breaks ("when patterns break themselves"). Cost is visible in the renunciation itself. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "echo" which occasionally strains concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: journalist's call → Elara discovers accusation → she applies proof by contradiction → decides to intervene. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elara shifts from orbiting regret to breaking free, with visible cost in abandoning protective silence. The proof-by-contradiction sequence provides meaningful tightening that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara connecting with her daughter's spirit and receiving forgiveness, with visible emotional cost throughout. The accumulative/textural lens holds as time-folding imagery and lost sounds build toward the closure. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanism where the firmware perfectly translates and delivers forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mandala's creation building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where individual struggles cohere into collective understanding. The "emergent hush" and shared participation constitute visible change, though the cost remains primarily atmospheric rather than decisively felt—the "tentative peace" suggests transformation without showing what was sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the automaton transforms into "Guardian of Whispers," with cost implied through Elias's retrocognitive suffering and the risk of awakening mercy in machines. The causal lens holds as each beat builds toward the renaming, though the transformation's mechanics could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation from despair to "luminous possibility," with the tarot coin as tangible proof of change. The accumulative/textural lens holds as synesthetic impressions build toward the closure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see possibility but not what Elara must sacrifice or endure to claim it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Alex's skepticism transforms into "enriched" acceptance through the telepathic connection, with cost visible in confronting Mia's fears about his disinterest. The causal chain from shock to telepathy to somatic navigation holds. The closure lands with "newfound clarity," though the transformation feels slightly mechanical in places.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    The accumulative structure builds texture through cave exploration and fossil discovery, but closure lacks decisive cost. The ending - "ready to map the voices of the deep" - gestures toward future action rather than landing a present reconfiguration with felt price. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words, preventing orientation penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Eland reversing the hourglass and transforming doom into "boundless grains," with visible cost in the years of solitary vigil and the cliffs' groaning release. The accumulative/textural lens holds as button cataloging builds toward the echo's unscrambling. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the prophecy's mechanics—how exactly cataloging buttons unscrambles echoes remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the snow-encoding collaboration and Elias's realization that courage exists "in quiet, daring acts of fixing the broken." The accumulative lens holds as imagery (mist, snow, spring) builds toward this crystallization. Cost is visible in the risk of trusting Mira and the impermanence of their snow-coded message.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's realization that protection, not possession, forms the true essence of the promise. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details percolate through ambient awareness toward this crystallization. Cost appears conceptually in the renunciation of wealth and revenge, though it lacks fuller dramatic weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where kindness as the mechanism of persistence reframes the entire journey. The fractured timeline revelation arrives organically through the lantern glass connection. Cost is conceptually present (places persist through "accumulated kindness") though the personal cost to Elias could be more visceral. The accumulative lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation from fire escape gardener to harbor protector, with visible cost in the fallen petal marking "the end of an era." The accumulative structure builds through ritual repetition—rowing rhythm, prism adjustments, light redirection—creating density that reweights her purpose. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively as Elara transforms isolation from "cage" to "forge," with the cost of letting go palpable in "necessary fractures allowing light to seep through." The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering (tidal rhythms, brass reflections, stone hum) that builds pressure toward her final independence. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until line 3 to establish the fantastical setting clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias shifts from ghostwriting others' love to sharing his own truth, with emotional cost visible in his years of yearning. The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery builds toward the final connection. However, the resolution relies on Mira's convenient arrival and instant recognition, weakening causality at the crucial turn.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (discovers trickster signals → develops counter-frequencies → broadcasts disruption). However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara succeeds without sacrifice, loss, or meaningful change to her situation. The "quiet victory" and continued vigilance don't constitute a Decisive Change or carry the required felt cost for proper closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through spatial mutiny—the chamber expands infinitely, transforming Elias's relationship to confined spaces. The organ's reverberation triggers dimensional shift, and the key's discovery reweights his claustrophobia into "boundless possibility." Cost is visible in his "wistful sorrow for the confined world he'd always known." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from ribbon discovery through investigation to closure/memorial, with Elias's empathy awakening as the decisive change. The closure lands with emotional cost as Elias connects with another's isolation. However, the resolution feels convenient—the ribbon too easily yields Lila's identity, and the leap from portrait to family finding closure lacks dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (finding journals → decoding with nail → discovering truth → planning journey) with a Charged Poise closure where Elara commits to the redemption quest. However, the actual journey and ritual remain off-page, reducing the cost's visibility—we see preparation but not execution, which weakens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the glass flake granting "pixelated amnesty" for Elias's burned bridges, with felt cost in "bridges he'd burned, the songs left unsung." The accumulative lens holds as patterns densify around the flake-scaffold interaction. However, the hitchhiker's vanishing lacks setup, and the revelation mechanism through scaffold wraps feels mechanically convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the circus train imagery, foreign money symbolism, and startup rise/fall pattern culminating in territorial marking as closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias glimpses his answer about cycles through the act of dissuasion. However, the Victor confrontation feels mechanically introduced, and the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elara and Thorne decode "Burden shared, dawn breaks eternal," transforming isolation into connection. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we see Thorne's years of struggle summarized but not Elara's price for sharing it. The accumulative texture builds effectively through star imagery and dream sequences, but the final transformation lacks tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elowen unbends her guardedness to release the frozen confession, with visible emotional cost ("no longer fully guarded, her serenity deepened by victory's quiet toll"). The causal chain from failed illusion → exposed vortex → journey to core → planting seed → thawing confession holds firmly. Cost is legible in her transformation and the "quiet wars within" she must confront.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara stepping free, her roots retracted, embodying the intersection of dreams. The accumulative lens holds as scar-linking builds toward unbinding, with clear cost ("risking her very essence"). Minor orientation lag in the quantum bloom exposition slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Elara trades her burned card (remnant of her bartered destiny) to heal her brother, accepting "a shadow of his torment" as visible cost. The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraph. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery and atmosphere build toward the final reconfiguration where "roots and bones now guardians of the trade" reweights the orchard's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from humiliation to quarry job to finding the speaker cloth to deciding on the museum. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Jack's venture decision representing foreclosed paths and renewed purpose. The orientation is immediate and the single-scene structure holds. Cost could be more visceral at the moment of decision rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Elias achieves "intimate understanding" rather than literal reunion, with the cost being acceptance of permanent separation ("forever close yet ethereally apart"). The accumulative structure coheres through magnetic/transition metaphors building toward this transformed connection, though the knowledge fruit's power feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the librarian's routine ritual serving as the central action. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the librarian continues his eternal duty with "Wonder endures" as the cost-bearing refrain. However, the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; the fusion ritual proceeds without complication or resistance that would create genuine cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the pearl ritual that dissolves Elias's emotional walls, with visible cost in confronting abandoned hopes. The accumulative pattern of confessions building to transformation holds coherently. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract—"memories flooded in" summarizes rather than dramatizes the price of reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (rivers/rails/maps/graffiti) that culminates in Elias's resonant reconfiguration—accepting guilt as "not gone, but navigable." The cost is visible in his raw emotional state and the permanent loss of his brother. The closure lands through the accordion's "halting melody" and his measured steps "toward whatever bend lay ahead," showing genuine transformation with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around the unfolding cipher. Closure occurs through Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara successfully documents the unspoken words, though the cost remains more conceptual than felt. The piece teaches its pattern early with the cyclical reversal concept, but the final "weight of words finally set free" doesn't land with sufficient dramatic force.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's choice to perforate destiny, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where she finds balance between dream and duty. The cost is visible in the "hidden garden within the realm's vast expanse" compromise, though the mechanics of how the violin actually perforates fate remain vague at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Thorne's essence capture, with cost visible in his death and Elara's pondering of "How many more could she save before her own threshold arrived?" The accumulative structure coheres as ritual steps build toward the emerald's infusion. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the pattern-finding method pays off in crystallizing Thorne's memories.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's ritual creating resonant reconfiguration through the scalloping ceremony that enables Lir's rebirth. The closure lands with conceptual cost—contentment found in caregiving itself—though the transformation occurs without sufficient resistance or complication to fully earn the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with both characters embracing doubt over certainty, Elias recognizing his hollow detachment. The causal chain from campfire consultation to lighthouse revelation holds, though the cost could be more visceral - we see emotional recognition but limited concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    The trance-vision structure provides a framework, but closure lacks visible cost - Lir emerges "changed" without dramatizing what he sacrifices or risks. The revelation about Elara aging backwards constitutes information transfer rather than a decisive change with stakes. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly, but the accumulative pattern doesn't sufficiently reweight meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—the skimmer merely lowers the arrowhead and smiles while "hope stirred beneath the dust." The accumulative/textural lens could work, but no actual restoration occurs, no price is paid, and the wandering pulse remains unresolved. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear, but the story ends at the moment of realization rather than dramatizing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elowen discovers the keystone's "lingering luminance" that "No algorithm could replicate," with visible cost in his tears of recognition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward this crystallization. However, the mist walking sequence lacks causal resistance—Elowen simply succeeds without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias gains synesthetic perception, fundamentally altering his sensory world—"each flame signifying a vow to the colors hidden in every whisper." The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers toward this transformation. Deduction for the somewhat mechanical discovery sequence and the tag's powers being explained rather than discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the backwards prophecy revealing Elara as "guardian meant to witness and catalyze the next expansion," with cost implied through isolation in the contracted universe. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static bursts layer into revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs. The whispered declaration "The stars will doubt, but they will return" and the universe stirring create Charged Poise, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through crystallized fears building toward the resonant reconfiguration where naming transforms grief. Cost is legible in "heartbreak eased fractionally" and the persistent constraint of enforced sacrifice shapes the ritual's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the dripping rates creating rhythm toward restoration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when spectral fish appear, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—Elandor succeeds without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off. The cosmic imbalance "wavers" but we don't see what was risked or lost in the attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from isolated warden to communal storyteller, with visible cost in confronting his father's death. The accumulative/textural lens holds as photographs build density toward the final gathering. Orientation anchors clearly (levee warden, twilight, ridgeway), and the closure lands with "turning echoes of the past into a chorus for the future." Deduction for slightly abstract resolution language and the convenience of perfectly preserved photographs after decades underwater.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the crystal's transformation as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with the creation of the wonder-evoking talisman, though the cost remains conceptual ("quiet triumph") rather than viscerally felt. The starlings' guidance provides the pivotal turn, but the transformation itself proceeds without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Elara's revised evacuation plan succeeds, transforming "peril into possibility" with visible cost (risk to community trust). The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from storm damage to radio reports to revised tactics. The orientation anchors (nocturnal arbor, platforms, Elara as pattern seeker) establish clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Kai's merger with his clone defeats the numbness, with clear cost in surrendering individual identity. The causal lens holds through because/therefore linkages: ego death creates numbness → clone emerges as rival → trial forces unity → merger defeats numbness. The custody battle framework provides coherent pressure that narrows to the single option of unity. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract handling of the "history rewrites itself" element which doesn't clearly constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mysterious seed catalyzes creative renewal, with Elias's business salvation as the implied cost of his orthogonal thinking. The accumulative structure coheres through water/flow imagery and builds to a charged final image. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the family's gradual transformation from sealed grief to restored laughter shows clear before/after with emotional cost ("knowing that some symphonies played on forever"). The piece teaches its ghost-story logic early and maintains coherent causality through the spectral wind carrying memories upward. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed cataloging of effects in paragraphs 15-16 rather than dwelling in one transformative moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the guardian's ritual of interiorizing the frozen garden to ease dimensional homesickness, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where uncertainty becomes companion rather than foe. The cost is visible in the "fragile peace, one breath at a time" and the acceptance of possible eternal exile. However, the middle section contains excessive reflection about the process rather than dramatizing the transformation through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative lens with successive approximation attempts building toward a Decisive Change when Elias realizes the curse is an illusion and successfully creates the phoenix staff. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the closure lands with visible cost through the destruction-creation cycles. The causality weakens slightly at "when the penny drops"—the insight about the curse being illusory lacks sufficient dramatized trigger, though the pattern of successive attempts provides adequate structural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when visions reveal the tower city's dormancy as potential rebirth, reweighting Elara's loss as beginning. The accumulative lens holds through layered imagery building to this revelation. Cost appears in "the loss forging her into a better interpreter" but feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally paid on-page, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the spectral grotto serving as a density increase that reweights reality. Closure lands through a Resonant Reconfiguration where passengers carry "memories of alternate lives now woven into their own," though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The piece teaches its pattern of magical realism early with "clocks run sideways" and pays it off, but the resolution through radio frequencies and glowing patterns feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens as Elias weaves patterns that increasingly manifest memories until achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when he touches the connection's texture while everything dissolves—a Charged Poise with felt cost. The piece anchors who/where/when early ("In the heart of the optical illusion gallery") and maintains causality as each weaving action deepens the manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's successful starlight navigation model, but the cost remains largely abstract ("grief for the unchanged benthic reality"). The causal chain from chain link to geometric modeling to breakthrough is present but mechanically convenient. The vow at closure gestures toward cost without demonstrating it through concrete loss or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's act of delivering the message transforms both the living woman's despair and the dead man's unrest, with the cost being Elara's abandonment of her original pursuit. The accumulative/textural lens holds as atmospheric details and emotional residues build toward the final healing. Causality remains intact though the coincidental interception of the signal prevents entry to the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves closure through Alex's successful release of the trapped souls (Decisive Change with visible cost via his conquered phobia). However, the causal chain relies heavily on the codex's convenient magical properties rather than character-driven choices. The phase transitions feel mechanically prescribed rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from radio static clearing through defragmentation ritual to wisdom gained, with Alex's "death" providing thematic resonance. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Alex's heartbeat counting transforms from frantic proof to peaceful acceptance. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and Elara's digital resurrection lacks concrete stakes or obstacles beyond technical procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cursed diamond transforms into a guardian of sound, with clear cost (the language's death, the storyteller's risk). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered echoes and textured descriptions toward the final symphonic preservation. Causality tracks cleanly from observation of birds to harnessing their patterns, though the exact mechanism of diamond-to-sound translation remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Decisive Change through Elara's physical transformation with clear cost (losing human form to join the returned). Causality weakens at the phone confession sequence where the trigger mechanism feels arbitrary rather than earned through prior setup. The closure lands but the because/therefore linkage through the middle beats lacks sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers a Decisive Change as the orchard transforms from mechanical oppression to renewed natural life, with visible cost in the statues' destruction and Elara's risk-taking. The accumulative/textural lens holds as her nightly playing builds to the climactic disruption. The causal chain from violin playing to heart-rhythm signaling to mechanical disruption is clear, though the mechanism of how music affects stone statues strains credibility within the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful closure through Earned Stasis—Elias continues his dangerous work despite risks, with visible cost in the "brittle hush" that could "shatter with a whisper." The thunderstorm deployment creates a meaningful tightening that enables the drone's passage, though the ending's "he glimpsed the healing" feels slightly abstract rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sensory layering ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "wind bells' chime") that culminates in Elias's transformation. The closure lands as a Decisive Change when his voice emerges, with visible cost in "his silence forever altered" and the implied loss of his former identity, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elara discovers the hyperbolic realm through analog memories, with visible cost in her "observed solitude now laced with connection." The accumulative lens holds as geometric patterns and memories layer toward revelation, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through discovery → preparation → journey → photography → transformation, with the sunrise photography creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes absence present. The cost is felt in "tears blurred her view" and the transformation from void to glow. However, the mechanics of how photography "vitalizes" the dream remain vague, and the lover's return exists only as golden outlines rather than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lock of hair transforms into a bridge of light, with emotional cost evident in "Tears mingled with the hush." The accumulative structure builds coherently toward this moment. However, the conceptual leap from hair-as-key to portal manifestation lacks sufficient causal grounding, and Mira's voice appearing feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.9)
    The closure technically lands (memories recovered) but the cost feels abstract - "memories held in escrow until she returned wiser" deflates the stakes established earlier. The causal chain holds but the fairy bargain revelation undermines the theft premise. The final "ready for whatever curiosity beckoned next" lacks specific consequence from the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands with Kael's return through the portal (Decisive Change) with visible cost in his confrontation of past failure. Causal chain holds from exile through tea reading to shadow demonstration to transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. However, the transformation speed strains credibility given the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformed seed becoming a tree that restores wonder to the world. The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery and atmosphere build toward this transformation. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—Elowen risks nothing tangible and experiences no loss or sacrifice in her journey between worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered revelations about the net, spirits, and family betrayal, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where spirits find peace through truth. Closure lands with visible cost—Elara's confession of complicity and delay. The orientation anchors clearly (mask restorer, prism sanctuary, night), and causality holds as each unraveled knot releases accumulated silence toward resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discoveries (indentations, light patterns, rhythmic vibrations) toward a Conceptual Repricing where the henge becomes "a portal to forgotten empathies." Cost appears in "reopened not by words, but by seeing the silence anew," though the conceptual shift could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "letting go was not erasure, but equilibrium" with visible cost in powering down the lights and ascending. The accumulative build through wire untangling to revelation works under the textural lens. Deduction for slightly abstract final insight that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through encoded graffiti leading to Elowen's liberation (Decisive Change with cost: his code unraveling from the machine). Who/where/when anchored early ("misty courtyard above the clouds," "Elowen," "tonight"). The because/therefore linkage from discovery of plate to encoding to Lira's arrival feels slightly convenient, but the closure lands with visible transformation and freed voice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through diary revelations, culminating in Elias's transformation from "ascending servant no more, but a keeper of encrypted light"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The closure lands cleanly, though the cost of preservation versus burning could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well—each categorized cloud builds toward the climactic coalescence of Mira's face, a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively (Elias, sky gondola, night). The closure lands with visible transformation as grief becomes peace, though the final paragraph's explanation ("The wholeness wasn't lost; it was merely rewound") slightly dilutes the image's power.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara discovers her limits through fractal precision, finding "strange peace" in accepting boundaries. The accumulative lens holds as patterns build toward this realization. Cost is visible in "fractally precise yet humbly limited"—she completes the work knowing it cannot achieve her original ambition. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the physical painting process.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery building toward a Conceptual Repricing where luminous trails reveal hidden aerial paths. Closure lands with Elias's realization that the hopscotch board encodes starling patterns, though the cost remains primarily intellectual rather than visceral. The piece maintains coherent causality as each discovery builds on the previous, but lacks a decisive stake that would elevate the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing density of memory and prophecy fragments building to the uncapping revelation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the released essence teaches the repair rhythm, with felt cost in the "gentle ache for the rhythms of yesteryears." However, the orientation remains slightly vague (what exactly is a "lunar-eclipse locksmith"?) and the stakes could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (planet destabilizing → ghost guides → bell rings → nebula heals) but the closure lacks visible cost—the resolution arrives without sacrifice or meaningful trade-off. The Accumulative lens could apply given the chalked messages building toward unity, but the ending reads as convenient wish-fulfillment rather than earned change. Orientation anchors clearly but the stakes never genuinely threaten; "brambled hope" is told rather than dramatized through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's lullaby crossing the pane of hush, with felt cost in his "bruised awe" and acceptance of inevitable end. The accumulative/textural lens holds as nested patterns and the puppet head accumulate meaning toward the final image. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, Elias, doomsday clock) establish clearly by ~100 words. Cost could be more visceral—the "knowledge that his adjustment might delay the end, but never avert it" remains conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal progression from inheritance to duty to action, with the night frost deadline creating genuine pressure. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elara accepts her "beautiful burden" after successfully guiding the pilgrims, with visible cost in her inability to escape. The blueprint discovery and wind-manipulation method follow clean because/therefore logic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns (foam, braiding, chrysalis) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena and Lila reconnect through the sculpture. Cost is visible in Elena's years of isolation and the tentative nature of their reunion ("tentative overture"). The orientation anchors (chemist, ravine, estranged daughter) establish cleanly by ~120 words, and the closure lands with emotional weight through the shared understanding of "divergent paths braiding back."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Elara's transformation into "the first story born anew" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (her vendor identity dissolved). The orientation anchors clearly (glass orchard library, floating, Elara as vendor), and the moonlight incision creates causal progression toward discovering the origin point, though the "narrative fragments" guardian feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain holds from dream to pool analysis to pavilion discovery, with clear closure as Elias integrates the stored remorse. The orientation anchors (desert fortress, post-rain, Elias as memory-tasting chef) arrive within the first 120 words. However, the cost at closure feels asserted rather than viscerally demonstrated - we're told he channels sorrow "without shattering" but don't see the physical or emotional price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with poetic density building toward unity. However, the closure—farmers gathering and building bridges—occurs through summary rather than dramatized scene. The transformation from isolation to connection lacks a specific moment of cost or sacrifice that would make the before/after truly legible. "The world below bloomed with unity" tells rather than shows the change.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("no longer just an engineer but the archeologist he'd sought to become") lands conceptually but lacks visible cost on the page. The transformation through memory modification happens entirely in abstract visualization without concrete consequence - no specific dream is actually rebuilt, no relationship altered, no tangible change enacted beyond metaphorical rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (manuscript guides path → avoids seeds → retrieves orb), but closure lacks visible cost—Elara escapes with her prize intact. The gravity inversion creates temporal pressure but doesn't force a true trade-off or sacrifice. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the quest structure coheres, yet the resolution feels consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the strumming sequence building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes enriched rather than broken. Closure lands with emotional cost (tears) and the grove's transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening paragraphs. Deduction for the cost being primarily emotional/atmospheric rather than showing concrete forfeit or trade-off that alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias's vow to return "not as a vengeful tutor, but as one who had found harmony in discord," showing genuine transformation with implied cost of releasing revenge. The accumulative lens holds as magnetic patterns mirror internal correlations. Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, magnetic nexus, twilight) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through recovered confession that reweights the brother's past aggression as envy of Elias's peace, with emotional cost visible in tears and the "quiet of forgiveness." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as layers of silence types build toward the final cataloging. However, the brother's voice materializing as "ethereal whispers" strains physical credibility without sufficient grounding of the fantastical element.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the corpse flower's repulsive bloom paradoxically inspires village adaptation, with visible communal cost (gasps, wrinkled noses). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and journal entries build toward this transformation. However, the causality between Elara's individual experiment and the village's collective decision feels slightly forced - the connection needed stronger dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage: gravity inversion enables navigation → water flows guide path → discovery of arrow tip → solution secured. Closure lands as Decisive Change with the arrow tip providing resilience, though the cost remains largely abstract ("ready to transform her world"). The Orientation Test passes with who/where/when established early.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from arrival through investigation to discovery, with the patch serving as a pivot that redefines the convergence theory. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where understanding the accident's mechanics promises future prevention. However, the cost remains abstract ("oversight's cost") rather than visceral, and the ending relies on telling us about foresight rather than dramatizing a specific changed tactic or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts resonant reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - spirits are "unfettered" without showing what was sacrificed or changed. The ritual proceeds without complication or meaningful choice. Orientation is clear but the accumulative structure doesn't build sufficient pressure toward transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the ritual building density through arranged markers, flute invocation, and spectral visions that culminate in Elara's reconfiguration from isolation to alliance-seeking. The closure lands with earned wisdom and a clear before/after shift in stance. The "avalanchingly quiet" atmosphere effectively accumulates pressure. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness in how the visions specifically generate the insights.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elias realizes emotions refuse full quantification, but this arrives through abstract revelation rather than dramatized cost. The orientation anchors (topaz workshop, letterpress operator, vanishing stars) establish setting early. The accumulative structure builds through repeated printing attempts, but the closure lacks visible price—what does Elias lose or sacrifice in this realization beyond intellectual adjustment?

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the pendant exchange serving as the decisive moment that transforms both Kael's worldview and validates Elara's purpose, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where individual acts accumulate into myth. The closure lands with visible cost—Elara's eventual fade into legend mirrors Thorne's absence—though the extended epilogue ("Years later") slightly dilutes the immediate pressure of the central encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through frost imagery and emotional absorption. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus experiences the mirrored betrayal, with clear before/after shift from skepticism to belief. Orientation is clean by ~100 words. Cost is visible but could be more visceral at the exact closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's sacrifice as a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with visible cost ("her essence fade, a latent sacrifice blooming into full bloom"). The closure reweights the opening's preservation theme through dissolution, but the mechanical puzzle-piece assembly and explicit message delivery feel overly literal for the lyric mode established.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change (stone guardians awakening, orchards reviving) with visible transformation, but the ritual's success feels predetermined without meaningful resistance or cost. The causal chain from silk-to-ritual-to-awakening lacks the tension of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery of her brother's truth and decision to "lift the truth's weight," with visible emotional cost paid through confronting shame and loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final revelation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality tracks through the shard's power enabling world-weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lamp's extinguishing precipitating the climactic action where Elias extends his letter chain to the spectral realm, achieving closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as the ghosts find peace. The cost is visible in "the luminescent ache soften into quiet resolve" and the ongoing burden of continuing the tradition. The orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, supply runs, Whispering Rock Isle) establish clearly by ~100 words, though the mystical elements take longer to cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Elowen completes her ritual as always, with only abstract promises of "change stirred, unseen but inevitable." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear, but the narrative presents exposition and routine rather than pressure that forces choice. No genuine before/after transformation occurs on the page; the "new dawn" remains conceptual rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered imagery (sun trails, iridescent wing, floating tea house) that culminates in Elias's recognition of his transformed nature. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as he descends "ready to dye fabrics with newfound hues," with the cost being his former isolation. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the pattern of tracking light to reveal truth maintains coherence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from mundane maintenance to mystical discovery to philosophical understanding. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's understanding that trees witness "resilience" and "mundane miracles" reweights his entire maintenance work. Cost is visible in his "long buried" sorrows beginning to heal. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the dying realm transforms through Elara's ritual, with visible cost in her "trembling hands" and the spirits' isolation being overcome. The accumulative structure coheres as forgotten songs weave with dawn-threads to restore the realm, though the transformation's mechanics occasionally blur into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's journey building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "staying while leaving" becomes his method of engagement. The closure lands with his anonymous note as a form of connection-through-distance. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we understand his choice intellectually but don't feel the price of maintained isolation as sharply as needed.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias uncovering the mosaic and transforming the courtyard, with visible cost in his confrontation of personal guilt. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of "secret warmth" against winter. Causality tracks cleanly from tea house establishment through guerrilla gardening to the mosaic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward closure. Elara successfully preserves the vows in crystal vials, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("trembling slightly"). The orientation anchors (frozen library, Elara as records chief) establish clearly by line 2, and causality holds throughout the preservation process.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with three false starts building to the closure where trust literally breaks and is captured. The closure lands as a Decisive Change - Elara obtains the recording that proves Thorne's betrayal, with the cost being indirect manipulation rather than direct confrontation. Orientation anchors (pier, pirate market, Elara) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara manifests "a mini-gust, a nascent weather of her own," with the cost being her surrendered skepticism. The accumulative build through taste-guided navigation coheres well. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt—the "skepticism softened" reads as summary rather than dramatized surrender, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage: Elias suppressed creativity → returns to cave → finds broken lock → must devise artistic solution → retrieves chest → uncorks creativity. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as he reclaims his artistic self, with visible cost in the "tears welled" and years of suppression. The orientation anchors (cave, alone after friends leave) establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from map discovery through vault revelation creates a Decisive Change with visible emotional cost ("mending the parched voids in her soul"). The closure lands with Elara emerging "renewed" and ready to share, fundamentally altering her state. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution of the map puzzle without sufficient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the sculpture's completion and activation creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that rekindles wonder's color with clear cost (her seasonal silence traded for eternal resonance). The piece anchors who/where/when early and builds density through craft details toward the symphonic climax. The cost is visible in "her muted vigor sated" and the transformation of silence into "something eternal."

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from fragmented to "whole in her pieced-together soul," with clear cost in abandoning the farm. The causal chain from magnetic shift to static surge to fear containment to escape holds well. Deduction for slight orientation delay and some mechanical resolution in the miniaturization sequence that feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration as the unlocked letters heal old wounds across the community. The accumulative structure works - each elder's tale builds toward the key's discovery. Cost is visible in tears and embraces, though Elena's personal healing feels tacked on rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based progression (dice rolls, dances, journal entries building toward escape). The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara surfaces transformed, but the sudden reveal of "digital consciousnesses encoded in the system" breaks established causality—this critical element needed earlier grounding. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3, and the spider-web metaphor provides temporal structure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias's realization that gravity pockets serve as repositories for deleted memories, with visible cost in his earlier choice to delete pain. The accumulative structure coheres as salt crystals, coffee grounds, and gravity fluctuations converge to reveal the memory map. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of the whale's beaching with his personal quest.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a form of closure through Earned Stasis—Elias successfully silences the prophecy—but the cost remains abstract ("the blaze of his motivation cooling to embers"). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with ritual steps building toward resolution, yet lacks a visible or felt price that would make the before/after transformation legible. The prophecy's actual threat never manifests concretely on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with weekly sessions building to rooftop revelation where the seal's truth lands with clear cost - their bond "sealed forever" through shared fiction. The confession "the agreed upon lies were her way of teaching him" reweights all prior sessions. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively - Elara archives the quarantined memory and transforms her isolation into independence with visible cost (releasing her skeptical shield). The accumulative structure coheres through the resonance ritual that builds from whispers to symphony. Orientation anchors (garden, twilight, Elara) establish clearly by line 2. Deducting for slight abstraction in how the "resonance structures" mechanically function.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward Elara's forgiveness and completion of the rebellion through the forged document. The closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as she "felt unlinked from her past." Cost is visible in years of isolation and the weight of carrying forward alone. The orientation anchors clearly establish the sanctuary setting and Elara's role early.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elara learns her mother's silence meant completion rather than loss, reweighting her grief. The accumulative structure coheres through the seashell's progressive revelations and builds to genuine closure. However, the resolution feels rushed - Thorne's defeat through song happens too easily without sufficient setup, and the cost of his binding souls isn't fully dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered ghost whispers, dream analysis patterns, and the melted globe's amplification effect, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's guided dream sessions will expose injustice "gently." The closure lands with conceptual cost—the cabin boy's eternal suffering revealed—though the emotional price could be more visceral in Elara's own experience.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's crystallized understanding and vow to share his appreciation. Who/where/when are anchored early and the accumulative structure coheres. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we feel the philosophical weight but not the personal price of his "demure audacity."

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: rumors draw Elias → discovers thriving orchard → finds diamond → reassembles letters → uncovers scientific truth → faces moral dilemma about exposing it. The closure lands as Charged Poise with Elias carrying "the weight of truth that could either save or doom them all"—options crystallized, cost felt but not yet paid. Who/where/when anchored early ("scorched remnants of what was once the heartland").

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the observatory transforms from refuge to beacon, with pilgrims arriving and a movement birthing—a clear before/after with social cost. The accumulative structure coheres as fragmented signals build toward prophetic clarity. However, the cost remains somewhat conceptual; while "cracking cobalt glass in spiderweb patterns" mirrors revelation, the personal price Elias pays for his prophetic rise lacks visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias combines his grandfather's laughter with the music box melody, transforming lonesome echo into redemptive harmony. The cost is primarily conceptual—the irretrievable nature of lost connections made tangible through preserved sounds. However, the accumulation lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully satisfy the textural lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias's own guilt surfaces through "vibrational grace," though the cost feels more declared than visceral. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic patterns build to absolution, but the intruders' convenient dissolution weakens causality. Early orientation is clear; the sacred artifact stakes are established promptly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the viaduct activation that transforms impatience into "enduring strength" and births the revolution. The accumulative lens holds as moon path patterns build toward this crystallized moment. Minor orientation wobble with "frozen lake below" at the end when they're at the viaduct in a ravine, but the closure lands with felt transformation cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Elena's liberation from controlling influence (Decisive Change with psychological cost), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories and observations build toward the breaking point. Yet the mechanism of liberation—whispered incantation as "psychological anchor"—feels convenient rather than causally earned, and the cost remains more declared than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through mutual forgiveness, with visible cost in both characters' transformations and the clockwork heart serving as effective metaphor for their healing. The causal lens holds as Lena's confrontation leads to shared reading of Theo's letter, which enables their mutual epiphany, though the light breaking through clouds feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    The accumulative structure builds texture through invention cycles but lacks a decisive change with visible cost. The bell ringing awakens leviathans and echoes into "realms yet unborn" but this remains abstract assertion without dramatized consequence. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the textural accumulation coheres, but the closure lacks the required on-page cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the recurring 47s build density toward the revelation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers the truth but loses the evidence, with clear cost in "files spiraling into whatever abyss claimed the truly deleted." The causal chain from pattern recognition to forbidden access to discovery maintains integrity, though the crew's survival explanation arrives somewhat abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the reconstitution process building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from awaiting the Council's verdict to actively forging her own tool for peace. The cost is legible in the "weighted breath" tension and the risk of acting before official sanction. Causality holds as each mirror glimpse builds the crystal ball's power while mapping specific community needs to solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Earned Stasis—Elara accepts her changed state and continues volunteering, with visible cost in her transformed perception. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and disaster work accumulate toward the final reweighting. However, the botched surgery's causality remains vague, slightly weakening the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira reframes "mismatches" from loss to connection, with emotional cost visible in their temporary bond. However, the accumulative build feels mechanical—each parallel story segment arrives on schedule without surprise, and the orientation arrives late (Mira's name at line 12).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elar's consecration ritual that binds the prophet's wisdom into the kinetic parapet, with the nomads sensing the change as "enduring calm." The accumulative texture builds from the prophet's arrival through conjured clearings to the final preservation, and orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. The cost appears as Elar's solitary burden and vanishing "into the horizon," though this could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara gradually assembling photographs to create communal healing, but the closure lacks visible cost—she simply steps back "with a whimsical smile." The pattern of "as vines climbed" creates textural accumulation, yet the final transformation from pain to "bonds unbreakable" occurs through summary rather than a dramatized moment with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's discovery that language remains alive despite being declared "frozen," with the cost being his solitary burden of this heretical knowledge. The accumulative structure works well as fractured echoes build toward revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. The closure lands with "knowing its echoes would persist" but the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently with density increase toward the hollow's discovery and sound-capture, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves temporary wholeness knowing its impermanence. Cost is legible in "the prophet felt whole" followed immediately by "Yet he knew the longing would return," though the piece could strengthen the price of this cyclical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds density through moon/time/ephemera imagery, culminating in Elias's restructuring of the clock as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (accepting loss). The leaf's fall triggers the transformation believably under the textural lens. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "escape velocity" concept, though the closure lands with felt emotional cost in "radiant peace."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered memories and the hymning method building to reunification. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when father and daughter reconnect through song, with visible emotional cost in Elias's tears and the years of estrangement. The vinyl shard transforms from symbol of destruction to catalyst for healing. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical setup of the daughter's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers the Noon Veil and confronts her lost shadow—a clear before/after with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres well through the loop-closing pattern. However, the personal cost of confronting her shadow arrives late and feels somewhat abstract, lacking embodied weight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara fuses tooth and bone, transforming her grief into "new purpose" with the emotional cost of accepting her daughter's permanent loss to the fae realm. The accumulative structure builds through memories and symbolic discoveries toward this crystallized moment. Minor deduction for the vague "ready to navigate whatever came next" which dilutes the specificity of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well: memories layer progressively while the sea glass transforms, culminating in Elara releasing the pearl's glow to help villagers—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (accepting earthbound limitation). The repeated "memories resurfaced" creates rhythm and deepening. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final village moment that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara offers the pendant, transforming isolation into connection. The cost—sharing her mother's relic—is visible but the emotional price could be more visceral. The accumulative/textural lens holds as moss patterns and dripping ice build toward meaning-making, though the young man's arrival strains coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based hope collection building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias merges the hopes and is "reborn." Closure lands with the seashell's destruction as visible cost and the nexus fading as consequence. Causality holds through the collection sequence, though the final transformation's mechanics remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the arbor's revival represents both physical and spiritual restoration with visible cost (the blight, the forgotten practices). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs. The harvest moon alignment creates genuine time pressure that forces action, and the closure lands with the arbor "pulsing with renewed life" as sacred practices restore.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through ritual preparation toward the eclipse moment when transformation occurs. Closure lands with Elara creating the luminous map at visible cost (tears freezing, starlight consumed), though the "translation of love's rhythm" feels slightly abstract compared to the concrete ritual work.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias completing his harvest, but the cost remains abstract—"ensuring wonder endured" lacks visible price. The accumulative lens holds but the closure's "emerged with his harvest complete" feels summarized rather than dramatized, missing the required on-page cost that would make the transformation legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she calcifies her own trap and steps free, with visible cost in the accumulated weights. The accumulative/textural lens holds as she collects and transforms burdens into physical weights that enable escape. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the pattern of collection-to-calcification builds coherently to the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands through the carved lion and tea ritual, with cost visible in "here and gone, but harvested, held." The accumulative texture coheres well through wood shavings, steam, and rain imagery. Deduction for the orientation arriving late (Marcus's death circumstances at ~150 words) and some abstract philosophizing mid-piece that briefly stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's negotiation with her ghost, showing ambitions "no longer eroded but reshaped." The accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments build toward this crystallization. Cost is implied through "regret washed over her fully now" but lacks a specific, visible price at closure—the reshaping feels conceptual rather than dramatically paid.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—dormant seeds sprouting represents renewal from abandonment. The transformation from "tomb" to "cradle" lands with conceptual cost (the ruins' lost potential made visible). Causality holds as Elara's engineering choices build toward the hydro-system revival, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Elias accepts his path by bearing the weight of his abandoned dream. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently, building through sensory details toward the closure where he finds peace "not in forgetting, but in honoring." The cost is felt through his tears and the "full measure of his regret," though the causality between crystals whispering and his transformation feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: seeking legend → finding chest → discovering forgeries → gaining insight about lies' evolution. The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Elias reweights his entire pursuit, with cost visible in recognizing years wasted. The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of finding the chest just as he contemplates deception's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through patient knot-decoding to the weaver's appearance, creating Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias receives the enchanted seed. The cost is visible—trading his lightning-born vessel and enduring physical discomfort—though the final "ready to plant and ponder anew" could land with more weight. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves understanding of "explained absences." The closure lands with emotional cost—his continued isolation balanced against wisdom gained. Slight deduction because the transformation feels more stated than fully dramatized in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear accumulative/textural lens with the egg's hatching as closure, and cost is visible in the "bitterly sweet" imperfect revival. However, the closure lacks full resonance because the transformation happens TO Elandor rather than through his agency—he merely witnesses the predetermined outcome rather than making a decisive choice that costs him something specific.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the scarred tree's song validates Elara's belief that "scars can sing." The closure lands with conceptual cost (transformation requires patient tending and acceptance of damage), though the causality feels slightly convenient—the tree literally singing strains credibility without establishing magical realism earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clear Decisive Change lands on-page: stained glass box opens → memories release → fountains revive, with the cost being Elara's prolonged vigil and partial surrender of skepticism. The hybrid lens holds adequately, though the shift from accumulative patience to causal mechanics ("heat from my glow could loosen it") feels slightly mechanical. Orientation anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through falling petals, generational patterns, and the gear's infinite calculations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where young beings "unfold differently." Cost exists conceptually in the "generational chains" and "loops that approximated infinity" but lacks a specific, felt price at closure—the transformation happens without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias shifts from static stone-carving to understanding grief as "woven, retraced, and shared," with visible cost in abandoning his previous methods. The ghost's mentorship creates coherent pressure that builds to the final realization about collective grief as "a woven, poetic storm." Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the ghost's appearance and wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through the inscription ritual toward the pendulum's pause moment. The Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elias transfers his confessions to the clock's mechanism, though the magical element ("invisible flame") breaks established realism without prior grounding. Cost is visible in his years of guilt and secret labor, but the village's healing feels asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias's act of placing the case releases the trapped echoes, with emotional cost implied through "heart aching softly." The accumulative lens holds as atmospheric details build toward this release, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    This is Accumulative/Textural in design but fails to deliver required closure. The story ends at "before the pen met the page"—pure suspension without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. No cost is paid or felt on the page; we have only contemplation of future possibility rather than an actual transformative moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when dust learns to tell stories, with conceptual cost visible in "the world inhaled its first free breath of tales." The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this transformation. Minor orientation delay (mist/alcove relationship) costs -0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through gallery descriptions, mask symbolism, and portrait ritual, culminating in Elias's dissolution into the vanishing point with visible cost (his own fading). The rocking chair's stillness marking time's end provides clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration, though the woman visitor's thread doesn't fully integrate with the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sedimentary layers as both literal excavation and metaphor for competing historical narratives. The closure lands as Charged Poise when Elias holds the chronometer cog at the crossroads of interpretation, with cost visible in his agonized wrestling between narratives. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively ("drowned remnants," "Elias dwelled in the twisting sewers").

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sessions building toward harmony, but closure lacks visible cost—the final image of Elara humming shows achievement without sacrifice or trade-off. The piece teaches its "subtracting noise" pattern but the transformation from discord to unity happens too smoothly, missing the required on-page cost that would make the change decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from abandoned greenhouse to transformed sanctuary with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The cost is visible in Elias's pruned memories of family loss transforming into "tapestry of strength." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early. Deduction for some causality softness in how exactly the fruit triggers widespread change.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the lacquer box releases "preserved wonder" to revive the drones and restore power, with the cost being the city's over-reliance that "drained the box's magic." The causal chain holds: blackout → Elara seeks answers → Thorne's truthfulness forces revelation → riddle guides to solution → wonder restored. Orientation anchors early with "amber glow of nectar dusk" establishing when/where, though the piece leans heavily on exposition through Thorne's forced explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Elias gathers displaced objects (orris shard, seashell, key, postcard) to unlock the house's secret. The Conceptual Repricing closure—houses as repositories of absorbed life—lands with poetic resonance, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with three cascading revelations building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts nuance, with visible cost in her tears and the shattering of her certainties. The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines. Each revelation deepens pressure and reweights prior material, though the mechanism of the ampoule's "elixir" revealing truths feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    The causal chain from mathematical proof to staircase rupture follows clear logic, but the closure's cost remains abstract - we see the door open but no price paid for freedom. The "yet in his grim optimism, he wondered" deflates the earned change. Orientation anchors clearly (staircase, Elias, timeless prison), but the ending hedges rather than committing to transformation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through lost language fragments toward Elias preparing to distribute art anonymously—a Resonant Reconfiguration where his private practice transforms into public action. The closure lands with implied cost (his sleepless labor for uncertain impact), though the exact cost could be more viscerally felt on the page rather than abstractly hoped.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the bread-baking ritual that literally thaws the frozen spring while metaphorically binding the community—a clear before/after with visible cost in the "fragile victory." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (rosewater dread, emerald lens, initialed breads) build toward the communal meal that reweights isolation into connection. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (grotto city, waterfall, Elara as displaced museum guide), and the closure's acknowledgment of ongoing precarity provides felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elias discovering the yoyo, reverse-engineering it, and activating the hunger stone to reverse time. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where time begins to unwind, with the cost being Elias's uncertainty about whether this victory is "merely another illusion." The orientation anchors (lighthouse, rocky island, clockmaker) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Elias conquering his personified fear, with visible cost in his unbosoming of secrets and the physical aftermath of resuscitation. The causal chain from reading paradoxes to confession to fear's dissolution holds, though the mechanism of how exposure "starves" fear feels somewhat asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure as the prophet transforms chaos into harmony. The fractal patterns accumulate pressure effectively toward the symphonic resolution. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—we see the threat dispersed but not what the prophet sacrifices or risks beyond potential destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain: pattern discovery → shell cracking → scroll revelation → confrontation choice, with the forbidden act creating irreversible change. The closure lands as Charged Poise - Elara steps toward the watchers knowing the cost, with "ready to...join their lost ranks" making the price explicit. Orientation anchors early (Turtara, city on turtle shells, Elara as cartographer). Minor deduction for the watchers' nature revealed through exposition rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (petal falls → Elias enters → finds letter → plans exposure), but the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost on the page. Elias walks away "resolute" with notes, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid, and the "bridge between buried past and enlightened future" remains abstract assertion rather than dramatized reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered absences—abandoned pavilion, lost dreams, family connection—culminating in Elias sealing these fragments into the foundation. The locket discovery creates a Resonant Reconfiguration, linking his grandfather's voyages to this spot and reweighting "interlaced absence" from abstract concept to personal inheritance. Cost is visible: he permanently entombs his family artifact to preserve collective memory.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers her ancestors deliberately sank the city "to reclaim peace from chaos," reweighting her identity and purpose with visible cost (trapped in darkness, risking deeper vaults). Causal lens holds: blackout triggers isolation → forces tactile search → enables discovery → transforms self-concept. Orientation anchors (Aqualis, library, Elara's role) establish by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's grief transformation culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration as he releases the origami cranes. The cost is felt through "tears streamed down his face" and "fragile peace" while the detached shadow remains—a visible price. However, the basilica sequence feels mechanically convenient (the gem polishing ritual works exactly as planned), and the shadow detachment's causal relationship to grief remains metaphorically fuzzy rather than dramatically concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Amir touches the pool and commits to "awaken what the world had buried," paying emotional cost through his obsessive hunt. The perturbation-by-perturbation build creates density increase toward the final pool discovery. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "unused potential" not fully dramatized in physical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the decoded frequency that transforms Elara's fragmented memories into wholeness, with felt emotional cost legible in "pulling her fragmented memories into wholeness." The hybrid lens holds, though the causal mechanics of how star trails reveal digital shards strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—Elias accepts carrying the weight of truth rather than manufacturing more illusions, with cost visible in "tempered peace" not absolution. The accumulative build through driftwood sifting effectively reweights his relationship to truth. Slight opacity around the watch hand's specific connection weakens full causality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from past mistake to present redemption attempt. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elias achieves "the first stir of absolution" through successful execution, with cost visible in his months of preparation and the weight of responsibility. The who/where/when anchors establish cleanly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with adequate pattern-building through the utility poles, but closure lacks decisive cost—Elias simply walks toward town with renewed purpose. The "backlash of regrets" operates as theme rather than causal pressure, and the transformation from broken to aligned happens through assertion ("heart and action finally syncing") rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Alex releasing the baseball and finding "a path to redemption," with visible cost in dissolving his only connection to his past self.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara finding the pool of lost time and vowing to rebuild family customs with Mira, with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure builds effectively through ritual layers. However, the magical resolution of finding literal "lost time" pools strains causality slightly, and the transformation from suffocation to embrace happens too quickly without sufficient dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira opens the portal, with clear cost paid through confronting shadows. The accumulative/textural lens holds as she progresses through photographs, each building toward the final transformation. However, the shadow work mechanics feel somewhat mechanical—each photograph predictably yields a shadow that's immediately integrated without genuine struggle or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's identity shifts from "destitute giver" to "inadvertent prophet," with visible cost (releasing his last treasures). The accumulative texture builds through "vibrant hush," celestial dance, and transformation motifs. Slight deduction for the mechanical prophecy fulfillment, but the emotional arc lands with genuine weight through "orchestrated coincidences weaving the fabric of fate."

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages as Elara uses the blackout to advance her revolution. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the revolution is set in motion with allies converging, though the actual transformation occurs off-page. The cost (risk of discovery, potential consequences) is implied rather than viscerally felt, weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost as Elara trades her defining elusiveness for rootedness, understanding that friction's absence reveals rather than destroys patterns. The accumulative structure coheres through the ritual sequence building to revelation, though the worldbuilding exposition in early paragraphs slightly dulls momentum before the active ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the storm/observatory setting with clear anchoring. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms his censored poetry into "rarefied" verse. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt - we see him creating but don't experience the specific price of this transformation beyond abstract "scars become strength."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands with Elias obtaining the maps (Decisive Change) with visible cost of combat and the needle card exchange. Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage from possession of card to duel to exchange. However, the rival's sudden entrance feels slightly convenient, and the resolution wraps too tidily with the contact fleeing at the perfect moment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's transformation crystallizing through memory, ritual action (scattering seeds/poems), and the final vow under moonlight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through luminous imagery and dream interpretation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the seed sprouts and collective memory awakens. Clear causality links Elara's interpreted dreams to the awakening, with cost visible in her lingering doubt about whether she's created another illusion. The orientation anchors (fantasy island, reality checker, ridge location) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias learning to "diffuse" his grief, with visible cost in the cerulean regret that colors his days. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the lace instructions building toward the final image of waves he can now navigate.

Orientation is crisp early; the closing logbook and fading paint mark closure with cost. The because/therefore is soft but coherent under the chosen lens, with the humming deepening pressure and narrowing the temporal window. The final image reweights prior material without breaking the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a Situational lens, pressure coheres from creeping gentrification to the envoy’s arrival to the co-op plan encoded in the finale mural. The closure is a Charged Poise: a collective resolve crystallizes with the chip embedded as keystone. Causality is mostly accumulative (weeks of coded organizing → mobilized crowd) rather than turn-driven, but it holds. The on-page cost at the end reads implied rather than explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: timed reactions, deepening hush, and approaching dawn build density toward the charged final image. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (grain, messages, dawn) pay off on the page. Closure is an on‑page earned stasis/charged poise: the last grain dissolves at dawn, she captures it, and a cost (loss/endurance) is legible. No causality breaks; pressure coheres around one dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: ship needs guidance → damaged drone → inventive diagnostic via refraction → patch → successful launch. Orientation is immediate and stable; the single-scene window tightens around an impending deadline. Closure lands on-page with the drone’s lift and departure, but the price of success is light and largely time-bound. Drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats accrue toward a charged poise: falcon proof → condensation confirmation → linguistic prep → departure. Orientation is clear and the closure lands as a committed step into risk with the outpost receding. Cost (potential death, isolation) is legible in the final image and earlier seeded pressures. One meaningful deepening (natural “map” on glass) convincingly tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition builds to a cadence shift as others join and the bells chime. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town moves from hush to living whisper, and Thorne exits with balance restored. Cost is implicit (time, vigilance, self-effacement), a touch light but present on the page. Orientation is clean from the archway onward; temporal wideness is taught and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation lands early (who, where, what clock), and the causal chain is clean: low oxygen → deeper push → vial → memory calm → unsnarl → seal essence. Closure occurs on the page with felt cost: she finishes as final warnings blare and no rescue arrives. The perils are promised more than dramatized, with minimal opposition beyond internal pressure, which slightly limits turn intensity. Still, the throughline holds firmly under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors and a coherent progression: approach → entry → chapel → ghosts → confession → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: ghosts fade and Elias attains hush; the cause-effect (touch lattice → visions → confession → lifting) is intact. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual; little is sacrificed on-page beyond risk and confession. Lens reads Hybrid with accumulative atmosphere culminating in a decisive inner turn.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative cadence: recurring cameos logically escalate the bead’s charge and the orchard’s awakening, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration (night shatters; debt repaid) with felt loss. Orientation is early and clean; causal links remain intact. The closure image bears cost (her dissolution; his sapped strength). The throughline is simple but tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the labyrinth is materially reweighted by nightwork, and dawn reveals a new social reality. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when), and the sleepwalking overlaps accrue toward the altar image. The cost is more implied than felt (fatigue, loss of control), which trims the ceiling. Nevertheless, the final cadence (“the canyon breathed easier…”) makes a before/after legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is immediate and the accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries (sundial base → gnomon → scrolls) reweight the stake. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: reading the lore by the reassembled sundial’s shadow reframes her doubt. Causality is coherent, though stakes rarely pinch. The on‑page cost at closure is modest, mostly time and risk rather than a defined sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene builds density toward a charged poise—she savors the moment before mailing, revaluing chalk over circuits. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when clear). Closure lands conceptually but the cost is soft, with minimal narrowing of options. The cadence tightens with the depot chime and arriving visitors, but stakes remain low-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (observatory, autumn, coup looming), and the piece crescendos as she synchronizes and harvests stories, culminating in the high astronomer reveal and the completed hidden chart. Closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she finishes the map, hides it, resumes the mask; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible. Causality is consistent within the magic logic, though pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres as images and tactics intensify (cut, heal, invoke, cascade of letters) to a charged reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (mangrove labyrinth, boathouse, moonlight) and the shard’s rule is used consistently. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she reconfigures her stance with felt cost and an altered future choice set. The cost remains mostly internal, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: meeting → decoding → confession → revealed poem → exchange of talisman, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: wounds as roots/flowers reframes both characters’ anxieties. Causality holds at the scale required; each step grows from the prior beat. The cost is modest but legible—vulnerability and relinquishing the object that carried her past.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single dream‑scene that intensifies through discovery → activation → projection → repricing (“joys… not lost but veiled”) and closes with a waking echo. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is clean within the dream’s logic. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt, slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the nested awakenings escalate via patterned use of reflected sound and return to the opening pause. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she relinquishes certainty for a stance of inquiry and answers the visitor from that reweighted position. Causality is motif‑driven but coherent; the “hobo nickel” and garden acoustics bind the turns. The cost is present but largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: plan → planting → drone descent → gourd activation → escape. Orientation is established early (who/where/when), and payoffs honor setups (the bioengineered seed and insect logic). Closure lands on the page via a decisive act that reconfigures options, with a conceptual price (increased risk, forced scattering) legible if modest. The cost could be sharper—no arrest, injury, or irreversible loss—keeping it below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the layered lullabies steadily reweight the dominant stake until the postcard animates and the beloved materializes. Closure lands with a decisive reconfiguration: the essence is ensconced, aching transforms into peace, insomnia eases. Cost is implied (centuries of insomnia and ache) more than pressed in the final image, but remains legible. Orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern is taught and kept.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual sequence coheres: crack → retrieval → song → lighting → replacement. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the Names glow again, yet only briefly, and the fissure becomes a “scar of purpose.” Stakes tighten around the cracked tube and the requirement to light by song; cost is legible in the acknowledged temporariness and lingering regret. Orientation is clear early, with a single continuous scene and payoff that honors the taught rules.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: preparation → promises inscribed → symphony manifests → Thorne witnesses → reconciliation. Closure arrives on the page with a Decisive Change (trust restored) and a modest cost (they still diverge at dawn). The path is smooth—no setback or complication beyond setup—so tightening feels gentle rather than pressurized. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Causal. Because he finds the chain/envelope → he analyzes adhesive → deciphers plea → retools design → first gate trembles into place. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (committing to measured compromise), but the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clean; single scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density (mote maps, training) builds to the break in pattern (sending truth), then a reweighted stasis on Aria’s safe return and the reply. Orientation is clear from the outset (attic, skylight, pigeons). Closure lands with felt cost: he risks the core wound and revises his operating premise (preserve by sharing). Minor glide through weeks compresses pressure but doesn’t break it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraphs (“sacredness arose from the hush before crossing”). Orientation is swift and clean; single scene coherence is maintained around the table, terrace, and logbook. Closure lands, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. The sequence of analyzing grain → cross‑referencing codes → childhood threshold memory forms a clear tightening without causal leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens via patterning—drift, discovery of the luminous respite, ritual, synchronized breath—toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean and the single-scene flow holds. Closure lands with a before/after (“forever attuned”), though the cost is soft rather than sharply priced. Causality between choices is intact and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single‑scene accumulative/textural design is coherent, with a present‑tense inquiry tightening toward a conceptual repricing. Closure arrives as the map and realization that vanished paths are natural drift/time, a resonant but quiet cost. Orientation is crisp early; the lens holds. Slight softness: the “before memory fades” clock rarely constrains choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: details layer until the between-acts crescendo, then the lights cue a cadence shift and release. Causality is coherent—Elias seeds the bishop, cues the musician, rides the gust—and closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the interlude ends. Cost is subtle (Elias’s invisibility and the fleeting window), which keeps the payoff quiet rather than decisive. Orientation is strong early, with no teleporting props or broken setups.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual focus → observing gaps → anchoring → fledging with cost. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: spirit lifts while body remains bound, reconfiguring her fate with a visible price. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and causality reads consistent within the mythic rules. No soft reset or convenience patches.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual builds meaning through light, water, and glass until a conceptual repricing (cherish the mundane as path forward). Orientation is clean from the start, and the scene stays within one continuous window. Closure lands on the page as an internal reconfiguration with a felt, if gentle, cost: accepting change without external resistance. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, which softens impact but doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: ridge walk → pause → opening the box → telling → shared tears → dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the box returns to the pack “lighter now,” signaling cost and transfer. Orientation is clean early; reflection is anchored to present action. Causality is gentle but consistent, with no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-scene coherence holds with a taught pattern: read the gauge, launch trial balloon, adjust decoration, observe rift response. The accumulative/textural lens fits: density of patterned actions reweights the central stake toward a conceptual closure (“hope’s new calculus”). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a charged final image (gauge steady), though cost remains largely implicit. Causality is clean; escalation is modest but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from sound‑mapping to artifact discovery to a reweighted understanding—closure as resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early; single scene coherence holds. The ending’s cost is quieter (shared culpability and a reframed mission) but on the page through the “sighing corridor” and vow. A bit more consequence or narrowed optioning would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned singing/painting intensifies until mirrors ripple and reconfigure what reflections can be. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the first bell tolls as the mirrors reveal possibilities, while the cost is legibly on the page (the heartbeat quickens; dissolution implied). Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). The beat sequence is coherent, though resistance is gentle rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: alignment → ritual → spirits → oaths → price paid → treaty bound. Closure lands on the page with cost (life-force siphoned) and a clear before/after. The structure is single-scene, tight, and purpose-driven, though the middle lacks a complicating turn from the spirits. The lens reads as Causal with a lyric surface and holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with a causal dominant: following the crack‑map → locating the valve → releasing water → cracking the egg → rain. Closure lands with on‑page cost: his fortunes and schemes will be exposed. The magical echo is set up early enough that the rain reads as earned within the story’s logic. Single scene coherence holds, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from approach to ritual to release, culminating in the chorus and blizzard. Orientation is clean early (who/where/goal). Closure lands with the sanctuary’s pulse and the realm’s awakening; cost is implied but legible in the threat of wrath. The single tightening—the last thread and the burst—reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: argument → hush → object handling → plan, culminating in a conceptual turn. Closure is a decisive reorientation with implied cost (loss of income/status; Lena’s absence as price and catalyst). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). The cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, but lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density (materials → knot → hum) builds until the monarch’s interruption reweights meaning. Closure is on-page as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis—he releases control and accepts incomplete resolution—with an implied cost to his method. Orientation is clean from the outset. The single-scene structure tightens efficiently without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density and ritual action build to a resonant reconfiguration when light and voices emerge. Orientation is crisp early, and the sequence (study card → rebraid → tug → illumination/sound) reads clean. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the years lost and the charged relief of finally hearing the names. A hair of convenience remains (no on‑page risk of failure), but causality is intact for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative end: storm pressure and discovery lead to a dream‑mediated realization that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she bridges hindsight to foresight and steps out changed. Orientation is solid from the start; the throughline remains coherent. The cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene accumulative design holds: ritual → activation → portal → vow → closure. Orientation is clean early; cause/effect is legible with the tile and schematic as drivers. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he is now bound—though the cost is more stated than enacted. The build is smooth rather than tensile, but coherent under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene with coherent causality: Elara leads → pin engages cellular memory → physical tracing → release. The sanctuary’s rules (silence, shifting reality, reappearing pin) are established early and utilized to resolve the core problem. Closure lands as a decisive change (resentment dissolves), though the cost is modest. Lens: Situational, held cleanly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: breathing + mirror + fog intensify toward a portal and capture. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and causality within the ritual holds. Closure lands on page—dream is captured and the orchard’s role reweighted—though the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized. The tightening is singular but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive holds: a causal chain (gust → dangling → bag spill → poem read → reweighted meaning) delivers a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The “accidents” are thematically framed and do not cheapen causality; they complicate rather than magically solve. Closure lands on the fused ribbon and shared line about accidents with palpable emotional cost (accepting a seasonal bond that can break and renew). Orientation is clean early and the single‑scene window is respected.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene pressure is coherent: inquiry → spectral answer → cameo etching → warning (cracks) → resolved stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts the curatorial role with awareness of solitude and potential erasure. Causality is clear within the accumulative/lyric frame; the cost is legible though mostly conceptual. No orientation debt; pattern and lens hold.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric accents. Because/therefore links are clean: vow → need to renegotiate → research gaps → chronal lily loophole → access and rescue knowledge. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (renegotiated terms) and an endpoint (reaching the Library), though the felt cost of secrecy is modest. Orientation is strong from the outset; no lens ambiguity at close.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: story pressure builds through repeated ritualized telling until the fog lifts. Closure lands on the page (reunion achieved; fog parts; she disembarks) with a coherent before/after. The constraint—bound to the ship until narrative completion—links cause to effect. The cost is conceptual rather than viscerally priced, slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causal chain is clear: anomaly → chamber → rope reconfiguration → merge → stabilization. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: the fables coalesce, history is restored, and the door stabilizes. The lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal and holds. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the lack of sacrifice trims impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: intrusion → descent → ice‑reading → invocation → hush bloom. Orientation is solid early, and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—the caves recalibrated to a tempered peace—though the cost is more implied effort than a sharp on‑page price. No significant lens ambiguity or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: prism → retrocognitive visions → star‑path method → search in thistles → recovery → repair → rekindling. Closure is decisive and on the page (the beacon ignites and draws survivors), with a felt if light cost. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; single POV, one primary throughline. The neatness of the find slightly softens pressure but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm → whispers focus → anomalies → inscription, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (“no longer just an archivist, but a bridge”). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the persistent constraint (solid fog/isolation; fading whispers) shapes tactics. Closure lands via a charged poise: the storm wanes, whispers fade, yet her new stance and archive endure with implied cost. The because/therefore chain is soft, but the cadence shift and constraint‑charged final image satisfy the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density of pattern (chants, hush, mosaic, spin) builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the mosaic → ignition → revelation chain reads coherent. Closure lands on-page as a charged poise/earned shift with a small but present risk cost. No major causal gaps; the because/therefore is gentle but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pause densifies into a charged poise: cicada placement → foresight → Elara’s “What if I can’t let go?” → the handoff and line about tides. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (accepting separation and uncertainty) rather than a decisive change. Orientation is clean early, and the lens stays consistent. The cost is felt but modestly surfaced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: clear because/therefore chain from inversion to ascent to collecting to core hush to descent, with the hour constraint tightening options. Closure lands: she returns with silences, sips them, and her claustrophobia reconfigures into “resilient openness.” The cost—risk of missing the window, emotional strain, and enforced isolation tactics—reads on the page. Orientation is clean early and maintained through the trellis sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds pressure via hush, echo, and the storm glass’s changing states until a cadence shift: Mira quiets and the vial clears. Orientation is strong from the opening image of the terrace and gondola. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the cost is subtle—Mira relinquishes her defensive chatter and Elias risks vulnerability by sharing his loss. The because/therefore is soft but coherent through patterned hush and response.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: leave tower → waterfall gate → orchard → peel → socket → stairs → ascent → claim. Closure lands (Decisive Change) with the throne claimed and the city reconfigured, but cost is light and largely time‑based. No major reversal; the single tightening is the final layer/socket reveal under the dawn deadline. Orientation is clear and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a coherent Hybrid drive (situational pressure with causal moves) culminating in Earned Stasis: the threshold vanishes, Lorin recedes, and Elara accepts renewed isolation. Causality holds (encroachment → knock → scars link → release → seal), and cost is legible in the final image. The tightening around the fading threshold lends urgency without overcomplication. A sharper before/after articulation of what is lost beyond solitude could lift the charge further.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence (messages → volunteering → descent → bolt → diamonds → sharing) is clean and legible with early orientation and a decisive on-page change. Closure lands, but cost is modest; the mission presents little real resistance and the bolt yields quickly. The ending resolves the dominant stake but without a complicating turn that would sharpen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The because/therefore chain is clean: return → crank → standing waves → confession → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the lineage and reweights his father’s act; the cost is the finality of identity and inheritance, felt in his exit. One scene, single POV, and a measured deepening through the auditory reveal keep structure tight.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterning of vines/program/strings coheres to a resonant reconfiguration: he binds himself as guardian. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the beat flow (find program → decipher patterns → ritual → gauntlet drop) feels earned. The cost is symbolic but legible; we sense the foreclosing of the knight’s prior stance. Pressure could intensify more causally, but the cadence shift at the climax lands.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when established), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: dust → folder → button → soldier’s act → Elara’s decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to digitizing and symbolically clears dust, reweighting her grief. The cost is primarily emotional and understated rather than sharply dramatized. Still, the patterning coheres, and no causality breaks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Causal. Because/therefore escalation is clean: raid → flight → puddle‑map route → lagoon booth → broadcast → glitch → reflective workaround → citywide reappearance. Closure lands on the page with cost (public broadcast breaks the regime’s apathy engine; comrades lost, danger persists), reading as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid. A few conveniences (puddle cartography; optical signal boost) are hand‑wavy but internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the hush densifies through negative space until the prophecy fades. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when and the atrium’s function), and the pattern is taught then paid off. Closure arrives on the page with the long final silence; the cost is primarily emotional, not structural, but legible. Single scene coherence, one dominant stake, and a clean cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.7)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the ritual’s patterned buildup (monuments → prod → glow → whirlwind → apparition) coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with a before/after (ally gained, skies subtly brightened), but cost is soft or absent. Orientation is clean from the start and the single-scene window holds. The ending’s change feels earned by the established ritual logic, though consequence remains largely positive.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: coincidences → greenhouse → compass → ledge improvisation → crystal chamber clock. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing as he rebuilds by feel. Cost is present (risk, surrendering plans) but soft; no injury or loss beyond risk. Orientation is clean, and set-ups pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural build is steady from foundry setup to zodiac-forged reconstitution. Orientation is clean early; the object and process return coherently to close. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (regret to acceptance via successful recreation), though the cost is more tonal than dramatized. Because/therefore causality exists but is secondary to cadence and pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because she plays the misaligned harp, Thorne materializes; because confession unfolds, she modulates into laughter; therefore release occurs. Closure is a decisive change (soul dissolves to light) with an on‑page cost (confession and reweighting of the tooth). The arc is single‑scene, cleanly oriented, with one meaningful tightening as the music shifts from sorrow to laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds from sensory overwhelm to a cadence shift at the beams’ convergence and the algorithmic realization. Orientation is solid early: who/where/why is legible by the first paragraph. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on‑page cost (she re‑endures the breaking and guilt). The leap to a tidy formula risks feeling a touch declarative, but causality within the chosen mode holds.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: market → painter’s guidance → sequential testing of paintings → final alignment and release. Orientation lands quickly and holds; single POV, single scene. Closure occurs on the page via the cascade of voices and Elara’s felt shift; however, the cost is more implied (burden borne/relieved) than legibly paid in the moment. Still, the beat pattern tightens logically toward the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: lights die → ghosts manifest → observational cue → dust analysis → hidden compartment → barrel reversal → release. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a before/after for the ghosts and Elias’s burden. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, which keeps it short of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong causal chain: frost pattern discovery → uncorking the whisper → imprinting the mandala → rupture → partial restabilization with a captured fragment. Closure lands on the page with cost: the orchard is cracked, order permanently altered, and Elias’s goal is achieved at a price. The hybrid lens (causal spine with textural lyricism) holds cleanly through the ending. No orientation debt; the before/after is legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal drive holds: storms threaten, mirrors amplify, therefore he devises covers, therefore a sanctuary enables decipherment, therefore meaning and stance change. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with a charged object and renewed purpose. Cost is modest but legible (resourceful labor under temporal pressure; acceptance of a quieter, elegiac victory over insurrection). Orientation is crisp and single‑scene coherence is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the causal chain holds: prepare chip → invoke harmonies → midnight resists → truth test → tether succeeds. Closure is a decisive on‑page change (light reclaimed; covenant renewed). Cost is primarily strain and honesty under pressure rather than a lasting loss, but the resistance beat with wilting ferns keeps consequence legible. Single-scene focus and one dominant stake fit scope.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp (town, factory’s hush, attic, cliffs) and the causal chain is legible: psychometry → fissure → lagoon → repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive change, consistent with an accumulative/hybrid drive. The price is conceptual (privacy, secrecy) more than materially felt, which slightly softens impact. Still, one cadence shift at the lagoon centers the final image and ties set-ups cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early, and the causal thread holds (GPS fail → archway → slide → visions → sculpt → leave). Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the finished sculpture under the archway and the packed slide reweight her future, but the on‑page cost is mild. One meaningful tightening occurs with the slide’s activation and her decision to create in the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the postcards → cathedral glass → dawn hush pattern coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration at the window. The closure lands on the page with a revealed message and emotional cost, reweighting the quest. Structure uses two shards (winter-to-spring investigation; autumn return) cleanly, though much is summarized. Stakes stay intimate but consistent; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: letters → diary → retrocognitive trap → debris parley → confession → map → release. Closure lands with cost: knowledge gained and escape achieved while the “searing reverie lingered like embers.” The inferred lens is Causal and holds cleanly; the final return to the zeppelin reconfigures options with concrete evidence. The parley’s success is brisk but earned by established code logic.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: beach temptation → laboratory conception → lantern lit → returners arrive. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: a real flame inaugurates a non‑wish path with visible cost (solitude, labor). Some middle beats are summarized (“hours turned to days”), slightly softening causal tightening. Orientation is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: silence → immersion → incantation → tremor creates a coherent because/therefore flow while the cadence thickens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: his archival act alters the city’s material reality and his vocation’s stakes. Some payoff is summarized (“in the days that followed”), softening on‑page cost but not breaking closure. Orientation is clean early; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a predominantly causal lens, beats link cleanly: hatch → ritual with cap/entropy → vortex opens → entry → visions → emergence with inheritance. Orientation is immediate and stable; props and rules pay off on the page. Closure functions as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: the inheritance is reopened and the vortex seals, marking a before/after. The cost is implied (risk, irreversible sealing) more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-scene Situational drive holds: the storm’s approach forces a stance crystallization at “zero hour.” The because/therefore chain is clean: repair → zero hour → hesitation → switch to observation → data shows veer → refusal to pull. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses the alarm path and coils the rope, cost registered as doubt. Stakes resolve on-page with a clear before/after without causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the brilliant star and tracing ritual deepen pressure toward a Charged Poise closure (reframed vocation). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closing image reweights prior motifs without a mechanical tie‑up. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional and could be sharper, but the cadence shift is palpable. No causality breaks or rule violations appear.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: discovery → contemplation → apparition → inscription → vow → placement. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a conceptual cost—the burden of carrying what remains unspoken—made legible by the hive placement. Orientation is swift and stable; no lens ambiguity. The causal links are soft but purposeful, in line with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres: discovery → suspension of time → code via flyers → ritualized speech → reweighted flow. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing; causality is more associative than mechanistic but holds. Cost is implied (risk of running out of borrowed time; surrendering mystery to share it), though not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: feather discovery → injured drake → harmonizing ritual → partial restoration, with a cadence shift at the gust. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: dawn’s weave partly mended; scars remain, a felt price on the page. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The final image reweights the whole with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story coheres around a steady remodel that culminates in the pillars awakening and a legacy stance—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (imminent death). Orientation is clear early; the diary and pillars feed a clean progression. The closure lands, though consequences are gentle rather than pressured by a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when land fast), and the accumulative structure coheres: footprints → convergence → artifact revelation → reframed understanding. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the amber recasts “homecoming” as biochemical inevitability with social cost. Coincidence (others arriving) complicates rather than resolves, appropriate to the lens. The turn is understated but legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: arrival → deciphering birds → targeted fertilizing → first growth → departure. Closure lands on the page with the underwater bloom and reawakened concord, a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive reversal. Causality is clean (bird calls inform placement; pods activate growth), though the cost at closure is conceptual rather than sharply felt. Orientation is clear early and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid lens holds: causal discoveries (leaf → riddle → cylinder → coordinates) accumulate toward a charged-poise ending (they step into risk). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the throughline is coherent. Closure cost is implied more than felt—leaving safety into the wasteland—but the cadence shift lands. A stronger on-page price at the final beat would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details accrete toward a Charged Poise: the glimpse intensifies into purpose and reorients her next move (archival search). Orientation is strong from the outset; causality is coherent (sketch → alignment → glow → decision). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with cost implied via solitude and chosen commitment. The price is subtle, not sharply foreclosing alternatives, which keeps this shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain: climb → entry via sundial lid → ward navigation → piece‑swapping → Archmage wakes → pieces trigger thaw → sky corrects → exit. Closure is a decisive change (board amended; sky righted; Archmage thawed), consistent with a causal lens. Cost is light—risk is stated but largely uncollected, and the confrontation resolves quickly via preloaded pieces—so the ending lands but lacks a felt price. Orientation is crisp from the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual walking escalates in patterned words (RELEASE → UNBIND → HISTORIAN) and elicits a response from the penumbra, culminating in a reweighted final image (pawns flickering). Orientation is clean early, and the single‑scene focus holds. Closure lands: the shadow unbinds and the freed gestures shift Alex’s status to “historian.” The felt cost is light (he pushes through resistance but pays little on‑page price), moderating the score.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: find alcove → acquire stone → perform feather rite → endure painful truths → renounce substitutions → depart to rebuild. Closure lands with cost on the page (the orb cracking; pain embraced) and reconfigures options. Orientation is clear early, and one meaningful tightening (choosing truth despite pain) anchors the climax. The feather method is introduced and paid off, avoiding late rule‑change.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Causal. The sequence—approach tapestry → decode frayed border → admissions of fault → tapestry’s hush cracks—lands a decisive on-page change with cost (confronting arrogance). Orientation is clean and the scene holds a single throughline. The price is primarily internal but legible at the climax when time resumes and his chest “weight” lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes/mist/spire intensify and reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: “One truth becomes legions, and I am free,” after conceding the cost. Orientation is clean and the ritual deadline frames the scene. Causality is lyric but coherent, with the spire/echo mechanism paying off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with strong accumulative cadence and causal linkage: each narrated repair stabilizes the workshop, culminating in the statue quelling the acid sea. Closure lands as a decisive change with legible cost (time, breath, corrosion). Orientation is clean from the outset, and set‑ups (runes, pockmarks, mentor talisman) pay off on the page. The ending’s world‑level reset is swift but causally earned by the ritual’s pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive holds: mirror crack → vow → journey → wrong turn → grotto → vow/repricing → return. Closure lands on the page via a Conceptual Repricing with cost (letting go, the spell breaking, tears). Orientation is clean from the first lines and the single-POV throughline never slips. The seashell trigger pays off prior seeds without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lens: Causal—he purifies intent via the cork, “beckons,” and Mira arrives under that logic. Orientation is sharp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the scene holds a single throughline to on‑page closure (Mira’s return). The decisive change lands, but cost is light and obstacles are minimal, making the resolution feel relatively frictionless. Still, set‑ups (cork, night garden, vibrations) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the waxing moon and successive calls densify until activation of the compass; closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (choosing to become a beacon). Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (hydraulics failure, censer foot, moon‑linked power) pay off. The causal spine is soft but coherent: failure → build → calls → activation. The cost at closure is more implied than dramatized, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Foraging → ritual prep → incantation → sensation of shielding → resolved descent forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: she believes the shielding works and adopts it, foreclosing pure rational denial. The cost is implied (illicit relic, risk in storms, surrender to suspect methods) rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it below the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean with a two‑shard flow (dock → lighthouse → return) and a coherent accumulative drive: object → visions → reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: pinning the Edelweiss and vowing to carry the burden; the cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is crisp early; causality holds without contrivance. The cost could be sharpened by a small on‑page trade‑off, but the ending still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: flood risk → cavern entry → chip discovery → glimmer → ants → keyhole → doorway → vision‑release → return. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and the live clock coherently tightens options. Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration: the vow transforms from burden to balm and the quest forecloses. The cost is emotionally legible, though not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal, held through climb → ritual → revelation; each “therefore” is motivated. Orientation is clean early, the ritual trigger is paid off, and the revelation reconfigures options (return to reclaim throne). Closure lands as a decisive change in knowledge and resolve with conceptual cost (temptation, future reckoning), though the price is more implied than embodied. No major causality slips or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds (embers/spiral/presence) toward a charged reconfiguration where Elara converts friendship to romance on the page. Orientation is clean; the one transition (portal) is motivated. Closure lands with a concrete act (offering the pocket‑sun) and conceptual cost (risking the friendship), though the cost could be pressed a touch harder. Causal links are coherent without over‑mechanizing the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues from cabin to lucid cliff, to flight, to grave-touch, to writing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—the envy reconfigured into craft with mortality acknowledged. Causality is clean enough (grave → lucid attempt → confrontation → inscription) with one purposeful transition. Cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping it strong but short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative design coheres: fog → arrival → discovery of the screw → confession → renewed drip forms a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early, and the closure image reweights the premise without mechanical tying‑off. The price—living with anosmia and grief yet accepting continuity—registers on the page. Escalation is quiet but purposeful; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a Situational-leaning Hybrid lens, pressure coheres: the held-breath ceremony triggers the crystallization, forcing a tactic shift to superstition, leading to shedding and resumption. Closure is an on-page Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration: immobilized → freed, scars rewritten into runes as the storm returns. The cost (risk of injury, exposure to past grief, relinquishing brute force) lands in the final cadence. Orientation is crisp from the outset and maintained through to the concluding image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly: ritual → apparition → apology → partial forgiveness → fading as machines start. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a bridge built and knowingly inadequate, with cost in the sister’s fading and the lost orchard. Causality is intact (induced vibrations sustain/fail the contact). Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies as the “hiccup” peaks, the spiral tightens, and the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is firm early (who/where/when), and the single-scene flow is coherent. Closure lands (conceptual repricing/resonant reconfiguration), but the on-page cost is light, reducing impact. No causality breaks, though the resolution feels a touch convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors and a coherent accumulative/textural drive toward a conceptual reweighting. The whistle → key → reversal → counting → realization chain is legible, and the closure (clocks measure the soul’s horizon) lands on the page. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it below the highest band. No orientation debt or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: sensory patterning and motif density build to a conceptual repricing where “letting go” reframes defense. Causality is intact (breach → diagnosis → tactical fixes → design pivot), and closure lands with the recalibrated barriers and exchanged names. The visible cost is mostly internal and subtle; external risk and consequence are managed swiftly. Slight didactic edges at the end soften the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Graffiti → line switch → library → lantern → realization → vow tracks cleanly, with one scene transition and a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing (she alters her teaching ethos) with modest on‑page cost. The convenience of finding the exact mica lantern blunts pressure but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure holds as a patterned night‑ritual that breaks when the musician calls back, prompting a Resonant Reconfiguration under a hybrid accumulative/causal lens. Orientation is clean from the outset (tunnel, booth, keeper, method), and the turn is motivated by the established wrong‑number system. Closure is on‑page: Elias recognizes his own need and reweights his practice toward beginning. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through an external consequence, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Holds a tight accumulative/textural drive: because/therefore linkages are framed as “proximate causes,” building a ritual sequence toward twilight’s threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: covenant reborn and Elias assumes the cost of a haunted guardianship. Orientation is immediate, single scene, single POV; no causality breaks. The price is emotional and ongoing rather than plot‑decisive, but it is on‑page and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clear: Elias arrives, sets a rule (reciprocity), rumor chains intensify, and a reweighting lands—the cure resides in the exchange. Causality holds under a textural lens; laughter and glow escalate into connection. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he binds himself to others, relinquishing elusiveness). No orientation debt; pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: increasing density of vibrations and notes funnels him to the stillpoint, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the setup (pause of constellations, ring) pays off in the final calm. The cost—conversion of grief into acceptance—reads gentle rather than contested, but the closure lands on the page. The throughline is coherent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under a causal lens, beats chain cleanly: anomaly from wrong seeds → signal exchange → pen awakens → probabilistic “edits” stabilize reality. Closure lands on page (tendrils wither; alarms quiet) with a legible before/after. The “editing history” mechanism is introduced and used, not late‑patched, but the cost is soft—no sacrifice or lasting constraint is emphasized. Orientation is firm from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: the mapping builds pattern density to a cadence shift where sound emerges from silence. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the throughline (from aimless wandering to public, audible music) resolves on the page. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias redefines silence and his role, with the crowd’s response sealing the before/after. Costs are conceptual/emotional but legible in the surrender of solitude and the echo of lost years.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a sequence of artworks narrows toward the tapestry and final recreation. Closure lands on‑page as a conceptual repricing of his arson—now a sanctioned role by the lost civilization—at evident emotional cost. Causality is tight enough (“because” moves from relief → mosaic → portrait → tapestry → portrayal). Slight convenience in the pattern intuitions, but it’s seeded as trait.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rhythm and density build toward a Charged Poise closure where a faint pulse answers and ambiguity exacts a cost. Orientation is clean early, and the scene stays single‑threaded. The causal line is simple but coherent (she drums; the world answers). The cost is largely conceptual/emotional, not tactical, keeping it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Situational lens holds: storm + labyrinth pressure forces a stance crystallization via the challenge, culminating in Elias’s earned win. Beats connect cleanly from incitement to outcome; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with Marcus’s defeat. Cost is present but modest (crew disarray, Marcus’s exhaustion), yet sufficient at this length. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterned light builds coherently toward the confession, which lands as a decisive change with felt cost. Orientation is clean (dock/boathouse/twilight), and the mirror‑shutter mechanics motivate the cadence shift. The price is internal but legible (“I stole from her, but I’ll make it right”). Slight telliness around the guardian’s purpose softens, but doesn’t break, the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp and the pattern—the hush tightening toward synchronized windows—builds to a charged final image where the town’s “pauses” mark change. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mosaic broadcasts choice and the orb expends itself. Causality inside the fable-logic holds, though risk remains mostly offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Situational lens holds: coherent pressure accrues from whispers → confrontation → whale call, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change. Orientation is clear from the outset (dock, sublittoral fringe, lovers in conflict). The closure image—she transforms and departs while Marek holds the recharged talisman—lands with cost. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early (farmhouse under turbines; mandate), and the scene holds a single window with one tightening when Mira and the illegal locket enter. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he persists in the risky ritual, aiding grief while remaining complicit, with the cost embedded in the final hush. Stakes never shift into a decisive test, but the cadence deepens credibly toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure coheres under a hybrid accumulative/causal lens: approaching → paraphrasing → deepening → environmental response → transformed hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the atrium shifts from barrier to invitation and Elias’s stance moves from conquest to communion. The hum‑risk frame provides a live constraint, but the on‑page cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean early, and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal chain: arrangement → spirit barter → color awakening → realization → counter‑arrangement → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with cost: he forecloses color and accepts his grayscale truth; the reed falls silent. Orientation is solid from the opening. The barter “rules” are inferred via action and hold under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early; the sequence coheres (ring → refract → propel → interrogate → intensify → summit → repricing). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on‑page cost (cracked lens, spent intensity) and a charged final image (“golden shadow” redefined). The causal thread is gentle but consistent, with because/therefore ties between questions and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal spine: origami beacon → observatory nexus → vellum tattoo → curtains part → departure. Orientation is solid early, and the closure lands with a concrete act and path reconfigured. The cost is legible (pain, trust, leaving), though pressure resolves smoothly without a hard narrowing or reversal. The lens reads primarily causal with a lyric overlay and holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: the confession and the discovery of the measuring tape trigger the ritual, leading to a conceptual repricing of Marcus’s options and Elara’s lineage. Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration (dawn, lighter step, tool returned), but the on‑page cost feels light and largely conceptual. The single-scene structure is clear and coherent without orientation debt. Escalation is present but gentle, resolved without a decisive on‑page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, constraints (avoid patterns, twilight activation) guide tactics toward a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is consistent: her pattern-avoidant dance purifies atoms; the pagoda responds; closure lands with cost (knowledge gained, innocence foreclosed). Who/where/when are cleanly anchored early. The final image reweights the premise without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: anomaly → archival comparison → origin revealed → ritual binding using the stone. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, not a handwave. The older founding footage seeds the binding logic, avoiding late rule changes. The solution risks slight convenience, but the cost image (“luminous regret lingered”) anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the layered actions and images (mist, maps, journal, tail tip) build to a resonant reconfiguration by dawn. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the single‑night arc is clean. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he redefines his operating rule with visible cost on page. The causal pressure is quiet, but present through a sequence of deliberate, connected acts.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—details (coffee rings, vines, hourglass) build toward an activation and a conceptual repricing of “closure.” Orientation is clean early (tower, dawn, post‑anesthesia), and set pieces pay off causally: plant urging → coffee‑ring divination → hourglass inversion → visions. Closure lands with felt cost (tears, re‑opened grief) and a reconfigured rule (“closure as embrace of scars”). Minor convenience (miracle mechanics explained swiftly) doesn’t undercut the on‑page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the film → psychometry → Harlan’s letters → conceptual map → reweighted self‑stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when she reframes where love is stored and her path forward; cost is implied (letting archived emotions reenter risk). Orientation is clear from the first lines and stays stable. The causal weave is lyric rather than plot‑driven, but the cadence tightens meaningfully toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from first meteor to shower, culminating in a reconfiguration where creativity is released. Closure lands on-page with a charged final image (rest renewed under aurora), though the cost at the end is softly implied rather than sharply priced. Orientation is clean from the opening. The throughline remains coherent and single-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Read under an Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery → charm → clock tremor → saplings and portable tick creates a clean cadence shift and closure. The closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: he accepts ongoing burden with the clock now ticking, reconfiguring the world’s stasis with cost. Orientation is strong early; set‑ups (Archive, clock, lullaby) pay off. The causal chain is light but coherent for this mode, with no late rule cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: successive tree-winds densify the pattern until the final resonance unlocks him. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he reenters his inner wilderness—tied to a concrete act (listening with the gear) in a specific grove. Cost is legible though light: surrender of the tool’s hum and a relinquishing of old doctrines. Orientation is clean; two shards (nights) are taught and paid off via translocation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the tale tightens from approach → punch → hidden paths → ferry, ending in a Charged Poise as she commits to the crossing. Orientation is clear early and maintained. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (foreclosing the “leash” life, accepting slow, indirect passage). The because/therefore chain is slender but coherent for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clean causal seam: stain → bolt → recognition → stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses to remain and confront silence, cost implied as ongoing self-imposed constraint. Orientation is solid early; cost is felt but quiet, not fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: library constraint → cryptic notes with rune → Vesper reads → rare alignment → his ritual backfires via seeded runes. Closure lands decisively as Vesper’s identity sunders; the cost is visible for him and conceptually borne by Elowen’s endless watch. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens stays causal through the climax. Minor summary drift keeps some beats at distance but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Causal: the storm-night focus, rhythmic tapping, and data assembly densify until the Morse reveal triggers a reweighting of meaning. Closure lands via a dual turn (submerged routes + father’s complicity/atonement), with a felt personal cost and a reconfigured mission. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no lens ambiguity. The ending image (“tapped a final rhythm—affirmation”) functions as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a neat tie-up.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Hybrid lens with a causal finish: because she activates the stone circle, dormant nodes awaken and signals go out—an on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is clean from the first lines. The turn arrives smoothly but with convenience; the solution is pre‑seeded yet low‑cost, and the scene faces no blocking force or complication. Closure lands but without a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal. The chain—kite discovered → script decoded → coordinates pursued → embryo unsealed—builds cleanly to an on‑page Decisive Change. Cost is present (physical risk, social defiance) though somewhat light and swiftly surmounted. Orientation is crisp from the opening and maintained through the underwater turn.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene structure with a coherent situational lens: a triggered episode forces a stance crystallization. Orientation is immediate (arboretum on a cliff, dark lighthouse) and the closure lands on the page with cost (trembling, selected focus, resumed motion). Causality is modest but clean: rumble → freeze → present-tense anchoring → pearl-taking → recommitment. The earned stasis/charged poise at the end feels legible without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal—pressure escalates (library compresses) therefore he descends, therefore he uses the tarot’s threads, therefore reality reknits. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with cost: the world mends and the ache remains. Anchors are clear early (artist in lighthouse library during a storm) and the box’s break/mending pays off precisely. Minor reliance on destiny language (“isn’t fate always disguised as coincidence?”) doesn’t break the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Causal with a light accumulative texture; beats link cleanly (sabotage → ink method → portal → discovery → reemergence). Closure lands as a knowledge shift (Conceptual Repricing/Decisive Change in understanding) on the page. The cost at the end is faint—he risks dissolving but returns unscathed, softening impact. Orientation is clear early; the single‑scene frame holds.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal line: discovery → mechanism triggers → choice to broadcast → immediate send → acknowledgment/aftershock. The single escalation turn is clear and earned by her agency. The hidden mechanism is a convenient aid, but she still makes the consequential choice under time pressure. Closure lands with a response ping and society’s stir, though the price to Elara remains largely deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats progress cleanly: discovery → interpretation → transformation into sheath → recommitment in action. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the sheathing act reconfigures her stance with the “muffling” effect and a framed vow. Cost is evident conceptually (foregoing father’s legacy; accepting vigilance), though not acutely dramatized. Orientation is clear early (dome, desert roses, tower’s fall) and held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern breaks, density rises (constellations lurch, waves collide), the echo surfaces, and the release reweights the premise. Closure lands on‑page as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he refuses possession and restores cycle. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame; orientation is clear from the outset. The cost at closure is present but understated, keeping it just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: call → analysis via contradiction → decision to invite → committed plan. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the letter sent and dawn arriving mark a before/after stance. Cost (risking family silence and reputation) is present but understated on the page. Structure holds cleanly in a single scene with reflection that feeds the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: letters → hidden device → tether with amber → translation → return to storm → forgiveness. Closure is on the page with a resonant before/after as the guilt hushes and the daughter’s voice reframes the past. The method’s convenience (instructions solve each step) softens friction but doesn’t break logic. Cost is legible (self‑marking, emotional confrontation), sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres: unease → creation → placement of the tile → reading the pattern → interjection → emergent hush. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when the group’s murmurs transform into shared, intentional quiet and participation. Cost is implied (vulnerability, surrender of certainty) rather than sharply dramatized, but it registers through the group adding stories. Orientation and object set‑ups pay off without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clean: plaza → discovery of code → lured automaton → vision that reframes stakes → ritual renaming → machine’s hesitation. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change: Enforcer-7 becomes “Guardian of Whispers,” visibly altering future options. Cost is present conceptually (trusting a former enforcer and remaining retrocognitively trapped), though not dramatized as immediate danger. Single-scene focus and one dominant stake hold well.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: Silas flips the coin, echoes fracture time, and Elara’s choice to engage culminates in a reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the coin in her pocket and a conceptual price in the bittersweet of unrealized paths. Causality within the magical frame stays coherent; no orientation debt. The cost is present but relatively soft, keeping the arc persuasive rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with causal backbone: static shock → telepathic cascade → somatic‑marker method → joint light painting → reconfigured bond. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the final image (embrace with geode, captured paths) marks a before/after. Cost is mostly emotional and lightly implied (risk of misreading and the recall’s warning), but still legible. Structure stays within one scene window with clean anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate and clean; the piece builds density toward the floating leaf and a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she claims her “voice” and moves to follow), but the cost at the end is faint. Coherent, one‑scene arc with a meaningful cadence shift, just shy of a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural spine: tremors → retrieval of the jar → cataloging pattern deepens → echo clarifies → slab hums/cracks → he reverses the hourglass. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and conceptual repricing (prophecy as echo of choice), coherently seeded by earlier beats. Cost is implied (risk during tremors, amber cracking) rather than deeply dramatized, slightly softening impact. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single, anchored scene with clean causal flow: meet → need to transmit safely → invent snow-coding → divide responsibility by handoff. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: a plan enacted and an internal renewal. Cost is present but muted (risk, relinquishing control, the fragility of a melting message). The hybrid causal/situational lens holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain’s ticking and ambient inputs build toward a conceptual click where the vow’s essence reconfigures. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closure—a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend as the gutters fall silent and the ferry appears—lands. The cost (foregoing family’s greed/revenge legacy) is implied rather than concretely taxed in-scene, slightly softening impact. Single scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: details accrue (sun patterns, smoke, glass) to a conceptual repricing—kindness as the rule binding the oasis across time. The causal hinge (glasses touching → thrum → fractures navigated by light) is coherent and pays off with the fused glass. Closure lands on the page as understanding plus an earned departure, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally pressured. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the petal’s fall prompts the ritual; rowing and meticulous re‑alignment build to a gentle reconfiguration of the harbor’s dark corners. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (renewed glimmers; renewed gardener’s pact) with a felt cost of vigilance and exposure. Orientation is clean from the outset, with a single continuous scene. Stakes track causally through actions rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: library tide → stone circle hum → sundial reflections → letting go. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she forges independence by stepping back, with the cost of accepting extinction and solitude felt on the page. Orientation is sound early, and the scene holds a single dominant stake. The price is primarily emotional but legible in the fading apparitions and the “earned, not imposed” quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the installation accrues meaning, the crowd gathers, Mira’s recognition triggers the final cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he exposes his own words, with a modest cost (vulnerability). Orientation is clean; scene unity holds. The Mira coincidence softens causal tightening, but the final image coherently reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: identification of threat → plan → targeted broadcast → measurable external effect. Orientation is crisp from the opening—who/where/what are legible—and the decisive flip of the switch provides closure. Cost is comparatively light, landing as ongoing vigilance rather than an on-page sacrifice, which trims impact. Still, the arc resolves the dominant stake for the night with coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear causal chain: compass alignment → hum → organ → spatial expansion → key revealed → repriced self-perception. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and held. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (obtaining the key) plus a conceptual repricing of “freedom.” The main weakness is the minimal resistance—doubt flickers, then the mechanism works—keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because-then beats track cleanly (find ribbon → research → identification → submission → memorial), and closure arrives with a decisive reconfiguration for Elias and the case. Cost is soft and mostly conceptual, but a before/after is legible. The structure leans on summary rather than scene pressure, reducing the felt consequence of turns.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a primarily causal lens, debris → journals → stanzas → nail → coordinates → decision tracks cleanly. The ending lands as a charged poise: she commits to the tribunal rite with a felt risk to self and station. Cost is implied more than enacted, but the closure unit is legible and earned. Orientation (who/where/why-now) is anchored early without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres: hitchhiker vanishes → flake found → scaffold wraps decode → map and “pixelated amnesty” reweight meaning → vow and charged final note. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the before/after is legible (bewildered witness → purposeful seeker). Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than concrete, limiting the punch of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative setup of cycles + situational confrontation) holds: the startup arc densifies the motif, then the Victor beat forces a stance. Closure lands via Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the territorial display repels Victor and reweights the foreign bills and cycle motif with cost. Orientation is clean and single-POV consistent. Minor summary stretches slightly dilute causal tightness but do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: telegram → lucid witnessing → healing words → invitation → arrival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration from isolation to partnership, though cost is mostly conceptual. Orientation is firm early; single POV and scope are well contained. The “final secrets” are gestured at rather than tested on-page, softening the decisive feel.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: failed trick exposes the vortex; therefore she probes in circles; therefore discoveries force the seed solution; therefore confession releases and the curse lifts. Closure lands on‑page with both a Decisive Change (lake calms) and a resonant internal reconfiguration (she’s “no longer fully guarded”). Orientation is immediate (druid at cursed lake), and set‑ups (seed, circles, guardedness) pay off. The cost is primarily internal rather than material, but it’s legible and charged at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: clipping → linkage through scars → covenant revealed → cost → decisive choice to unbind. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the closure lands on-page with a felt price (“risking her very essence”) and resultant action (stepping free). The beats move cleanly without teleports or resets. The cost is stated rather than materially tested, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: Elara seeks the Keeper to barter; the Keeper sets a steep price; she trades her card; cost lands as inheriting torment. Orientation is clear early and the scene maintains a tight throughline to an on‑page closure with cost. The decisive act (pressing the card) and the orchard’s response provide a concrete before/after. Minor elisions (how her “method” specifically aids the bargain) don’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single scene, clean anchors, and a causal spine: sift junk → find cloth → recognition → offer to buy → vow for a new venture. Closure lands as a decisive change with emotional cost implied (renouncing safety of pure appraisal to risk a new path). The lens reads Hybrid with causal beats supported by accumulative echoes. The cost is present but muted; Earl’s easy acquiescence lowers pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a mostly causal lens, the sequence—plant, wait, sprout, bite, repricing—tracks cleanly to closure. Orientation is strong early, and the final beat provides a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive contest. Stakes resolve without a meaningful obstacle; success feels largely assured once the seed is planted. Cost is implied (accepting an intangible return) but not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate and the ritual provides a clean cadence shift: collection → forge → fusion → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (conceptual repricing: acceptance smelts identities; the atrium is safeguarded). Cost remains mostly conceptual—duty and endurance—rather than dramatized on the page, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong causal chain: discovery → reading confessions → ritual correction (“crown the pearl”) → transformation with a felt cost. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change and reconfigured role, with the emotional price of reopening grief legible in the memory flood. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the single-scene frame holds. The lens reads Hybrid with a firm causal finish.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain → shelter → graffiti → map cross‑reference → repriced self‑forgiveness. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an evident ongoing cost. The graffiti catalyst edges toward convenience but is prepped by the station’s character and his specific search for a “crossing of iron and water.” The final action (playing the accordion, stepping out) pays the closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres as the watch slows signals, the cipher unwinds, and dawn/letter two nears. Closure lands as a charged poise: she withdraws with partial gains, options reweighted and a path foreclosed by caution. The cost is primarily opportunity/risk containment rather than a concrete loss, but it’s legible. Causality is clean and orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the causal chain reads clean: waning amulet clock → coffee augury → fern plea → violin act → propagation → renewed amulet. Closure arrives on the page through her decision and act (playing the violin and propagating), with a legible before/after. The felt cost is modest but present in the accepted compromise. The lens reads Hybrid with causal dominance, held consistently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens as breath thins, the ritual intensifies, and the final exhale lands with the chip pulsing—a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Stakes are singular and resolved on‑page with a conceptual price (defiance of oblivion housed in a gem; the dead released). Orientation is clean, single scene, one dominant throughline. The closure is quiet but legible and costed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: the ritual intensifies a patterned hush toward a final reweighting (contentment found in caregiving) while causally triggering Lir’s emergence. Orientation and scene unity are clean; the hairpin/veil/altar are set up and paid off. Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing with a visible effect (Lir reborn), but the cost is light and largely implied. A single tightening—Elara’s decision to perform the ritual—does the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single transition (beach to lighthouse) is clear; the drive reads Hybrid with an accumulative cadence that culminates in a decisive act. Closure lands with Mara unhooking the logbook and Elias’s repricing of his own role; cost is conceptual but legible (risking family illusions, cracking his detachment). Beats link coherently via the wind‑chime method. Stakes are resolved on the page without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ripple‑pond sequence builds toward a conceptual repricing: Elara is the living experiment, and the pedagogy is the point. Orientation is clean early; structure holds as a single trance‑scene with one deepening. Closure lands, but the on‑page cost is soft, more philosophical than felt. Cause/effect is coherent, if gently motivated rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from descriptive setup into the appraisal act with the arrowhead and birds, culminating in a charged poise closure. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why), and the method’s mechanics produce a pattern break (perception shifts to reading flight). The cost at closure is conceptual—choosing patience and internal alignment over pursuit—felt but soft. A single meaningful deepening occurs (decoding the flock), but causality remains low‑tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: longing → mist walking → chamber discovery → unstrapping → release/return. Orientation is solid early, and the single POV holds. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a reweighted stance (he returns with the keystone, transformed). The cost is modest (physical strain, risk, relinquishing passivity), but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats accrete cleanly from pier to wreck to tag to altered perception, with a legible before/after. Closure lands on‑page as a Decisive Change: he gains the color of sound and returns to his lamps reconfigured. The causal chain is tidy; the main weakness is a low visible price for the transformation. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene with coherent steps: lots → target a burst → distill → deepen → revelation → alignment → charged final tremor. The dominant lens is Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance at closure; density of images and patterning pay off in a reweighted final moment. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: doubt is repurposed, her role clarified, and the deck trembles in response. The price is conceptual rather than visceral; still, causality and cadence are clean for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: light, echoes, naming, and crystallization build toward a reweighted final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief is not erased but patterned into a quiet legacy as he gathers the constellation. Cost is legible (he has enforced a sacrifice; solace is partial and earned). Orientation is clean from the opening and the dusk clock pressures the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens reads clean: dripping rates → ritual alignment → bell rebuilt → toll → spectral fish stir. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (bell toll and sea’s first stirring), though the on‑page cost is modest (mainly exertion and risk). No unkept setups or teleporting rules; stakes are tested within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via the photo trail from public town images to the parents’ intimate photo, prompting the shift to communal storytelling. Orientation is clean and the two-shard structure (ridgeway → cabin/gathering) coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (forsaking solitude by making memory communal). The cost is legible in the decision and the charged final arrangement around the label.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: patterns condense (oracular starlings → will‑flame → crystal unfolding) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (altar, crystal, birds) pay off causally in the ritual. Closure occurs on the page with a clear before/after—the crystal becomes a talisman—though the on‑page cost is largely emotional. The chain is tight if quiet; no late rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean causal chain: storm clears → radio reveals fractures and updrafts → initial plan invalid → she revises → evacuation begins. Closure lands with Charged Poise: the descent starts and hope replaces dread. The cost is implied risk and foreclosing the glider plan rather than a concrete loss, but it’s legible at this scale. Orientation is solid early; the causal lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: decree of a trial → duel via illusions → blade slices pretense → choice of unity → vivification/merge. Closure is on-page and decisive: they merge, foreclosing rivalry with the cost of surrendering singular identity. Setups (blade, method of opposites, brain) pay off without teleporting logic. Minor convenience remains in how swiftly unity resolves conflict but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from mailroom discovery to brookside ideation and lands in a decision to act, which functions as a quiet closure. Orientation is firm and the two‑shard structure is clean. The closure (resolve to build “Corpse Bloom Mystery” and verify the seed) is legible but low‑cost. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than event‑driven, leaving the final turn persuasive but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the nightly cadence builds toward a reweighted ending where the household’s laughter returns while Elias remains bound. Orientation is immediate (tunnel, household above), and the final image carries cost (a “quiet vigil”). Resolution arises from his persistent tactic rather than a late rule change. Some beats are summarized rather than dramatized, softening the on‑page pressure at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: a vigil deepens into a ritual that culminates in a reweighted stance (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is immediate and steady; the pendant’s ignition and cooling provide causal markers. Closure lands on the page with the pendant cooling and the guardian’s reframed relationship to uncertainty; cost is conceptual/emotional rather than event‑driven. A slightly soft external pressure ceiling keeps it short of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene causal chain is clean: each attempt leads to a revision and higher cost, culminating in realization and decisive vivification. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing (curse reframed as illusion) on the page. Orientation is immediate; the lens reads Hybrid with causal scaffolding and lyric accrual held through the end. Cost is legible in repeated destruction of the relic and exertion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: methodical tuning and pattern‑breaking (discarding assumptions) lead to a final reconfiguration (the city as dormant, not dead). Orientation is swift and clean; the scene maintains single‑POV cohesion. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with a felt, if quiet, cost in the reframed grief and the earned stasis of practical resolve. Pressure is modest but coherent, with the perigee clock waning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under a causal lens, beats connect cleanly: clocks skew → grotto → hourglass + radio → convergence → return. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual cost (merged memories, reweighted identity). Some method steps feel conveniently available and lightly explained, softening the squeeze. Orientation is crisp; the single-scene arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: weaving intensifies, illusions cohere, then serenely erupt and reweight the stake. Orientation is clean early, and closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration with the thread expended and options quietly foreclosed. Causality is coherent within the rational-enchantment logic. Pressure is gentle but purposeful, achieving a meaningful cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean single‑scene build: retrieve relic → configure device → run algorithm → projection blooms → mapping → vow. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density increases toward a Charged Poise ending where achievement is reweighted by loss. Orientation is crisp; no causality breaks. The cost—beauty marked by isolation and the ocean’s unchanged constraint—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal chain is clear: hearing aid signal → photograph → decision → cottage → delivery of assurance. Orientation is established early and maintained; the two-shard structure (atrium to cottage) is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the message relieves the living and quiets the dead, with Elara slightly mended. Cost is modest and mostly conceptual (she diverts from her own pursuit), but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages (codex discovery → mapping invisible paths → phase-transitions ritual → release before the tide turns) hold tight, with a clear Decisive Change (the unremembered freed) on the page. Cost is legible: time pressure, physical risk, and psychological strain under a closing tide and trembling facility. A slight ease in the ritual’s success keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Causal lens: radio static clears → ritual initiated → algorithm engages → Elara coheres → realization lands. Orientation is immediate (opal observatory, snowed‑in, midnight), and the process escalates logically to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page (heartbeat slowing; reframed survival), though the felt price is more reflective than consequential. No major set‑ups are dropped; the chain of actions pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Held under an Accumulative/Textural lens: details accrete toward a clear RR/CR—language preserved as immortal echoes. Orientation is strong, the ritual acts sequence cleanly (enter → place diamond → align to birds → stabilize). Cost is mostly conceptual (risk of madness; surrendering his living voice to an echo‑archive), which lands but lightly. The pattern taught (texture→sound via canyon acoustics) pays off at closure without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp early: underground herbalist garden, Elara’s role, and the changed world. Causality holds: uncover relic → call number → confession → voices → metamorphosis. Closure is an on-page Decisive Change with a visible cost (she relinquishes her human path), and the arrowhead/phone thread ties cleanly. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: music → statues falter → rhythms travel the soil → vines uproot → orchard renews. Orientation lands early (who/where/when) and the lens is held through a decisive on‑page change. The closure is satisfying, though the price paid is more environmental turbulence than a personal or irreversible loss. No late rule change; the heart‑rhythm method is prepped and then used.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is immediate (mailman, disputed arcade, twilight) and the causal chain is clean: drones tighten → he releases the bottled storm → drone crosses → confirmation. Closure lands as a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he succeeds once and recommits under ongoing threat. The cost remains mostly risk and the finite resource of the storm, lightly implied by its decanting and settling back, rather than explicitly priced. Single scene coherence and one meaningful tightening hold under a hybrid leaning causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → oasis → halo fragment → hum → song, culminating in a clear on‑page change (he sings). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing of silence, though the cost reads conceptual more than concrete. The throughline is coherent with one meaningful tightening at the halo fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; density of image and method builds to a conceptual repricing when the scarf reveals coded verses and a “portal.” Orientation is clean early, single scene holds. Closure lands as CR with a clear before/after (“found it, or at least a portal”), but the on-page cost is light, which softens the ending’s force. The causal chain is coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern (whispers, light, cipher) and tightens toward the sunrise sequence, landing a resonant reconfiguration when the images materialize and she returns changed. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and causal steps link discovery → preparation → action → result. Closure is on the page, but the cost is primarily emotional and light. The chain holds without breaks or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a hybrid with accumulative dominance, the causal chain is clean: first star → vision → interpretive key → offering → portal. Closure lands on the page with cost (surrendering the lock of hair) and a meaningful reconfiguration (fear reframed as cocoon, idea freed). Orientation is strong and single-scene; scope and beats fit the length. The escalation is smooth but modest, relying on lyric intensification more than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: return → study “constellations” → precise press → memories flood back. Orientation is solid and the lens reads as Causal throughout one scene with a tidy closure. The cost at closure is implied (years lost) rather than felt in-scene, softening the landing. Still, the decisive act produces a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under a predominantly causal lens, beats link cleanly: portal arrival → tea‑geometry diagnosis → shadow object test → Kael’s engagement → reversal. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change: his exile lifts and he steps through, reconfigured by the process. The cost is largely internal—pride punctured, shadow faced—credible but not searing. No orientation debt; one scene, one dominant stake, tidy cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean; the arc moves from sensed waning → crossing → capture → planting → effects. Closure lands (RR/soft DC) with the seed planted and wonder restored, but the cost is light and opposition absent. The structure holds, if frictionless, across two shards (world A/world B) with a smooth return.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: unraveling knots and staged disclosures therefore release voices, therefore force the final admission, therefore achieve settling. Closure lands on the page—the net dissolves, the mask mends—with legible cost (publicly owning family betrayal and her delay). Orientation is clean early and the throughline holds in one scene. Slight neatness at the end trims edge, but the decisive change is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern-reading through silence builds to a conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean; the single-scene structure coheres. The closure image (pressing the map tear; the vault’s “exhale”) lands as a reweighting with a cost of renouncing imposition, though the price is felt lightly. Escalation via pattern accretion (indentations vanishing, twilight vibration) reads purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens cleanly: object found → wires/Morse → note → reweighted final image. Orientation is swift and stable; causality holds through tactile actions with no teleporting props or soft resets. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he alters stance toward loss, and the final ascent seals it. The cost is conceptual but legible in the darkened library and the decision to ascend.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The chain (storm’s pause → encoding → Lira decodes → mechanism unlocks → freedom) is coherent and lands a decisive change on the page. However, Lira’s timely appearance and near-miraculous comprehension soften felt cost and make the resolution border on convenience. Orientation is clean and the single-scene window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor intensifies pattern and knowledge until the seventh‑floor instruction creates the core choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he refuses the ritual—with a conceptual cost implied. Orientation is clean (elevator, spire, ascent clock), and the floor structure gives a legible tightening. The price is not dramatized externally, but the reweighted final image closes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds by ritual pattern (classifications) to a clear cadence break (the void coalescing), delivering a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why), and the closure lands on the page: the portrait appears, then dissipates, shifting his stance. The price—surrender of doubt and a reweighting of grief—registers in the image and aftermath. Slight neatness (a quick, almost miraculous confirmation) limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density of pattern and time pressure build to a quiet closure. The on‑page ending—machines rumbling as she accepts finitude and seals the coin—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (loss of the library) and conceptual cost (accepted limits). Orientation is clean from the start, and set‑ups (coin, stillness, condemned space) all pay off. No causal breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing (murmurations as mappable “stranded luminance”). Orientation is strong from the outset; the throughline (decode → map → possible discovery) coheres. Closure lands as a charged poise rather than a decisive change, and the on‑page cost is minimal. Still, the sequence of noticing, decoding, and correlating builds neatly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene proceeds coherently from entry to discovery to “uncap,” culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where knowledge and options shift. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the closure image (gears turning, future selves in mirrors) carries conceptual cost. Escalation is modest but structurally tidy and earned by on‑page beats.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: chalk → gathering → bell → nebula → stabilization, with on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is clean and sequencing coherent. However, escalation is smooth and largely unopposed; harmony is achieved without setback. The ending lands, but the visible cost is minimal and convenience weighs down tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds to the pane’s yielding and a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis close as the hush reseals. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when nailed by the lighthouse, clock, dusk). Cost is legible conceptually—he can only soothe and perhaps delay, never avert. The causal flow is coherent within the ritual logic, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and causal links hold: travelers appear → blueprint/nut method → invisible assembly → safe emergence before frost. Closure lands with cost: the nut is consumed and her duty persists, reconfiguring the final image. The because/therefore chain is clean; no teleports or late rule changes. Slight smoothness (few complications) keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid lens with a causal throughline: observation → insight → plan → contact → meeting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Lila touches the sculpture and both share the chrysalis, though the cost is mostly implied risk. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure is coherent. The decisive change is modest but legible and motivated by earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via patterned actions—pouring light, incising, counting absences—that culminate in a sacrificial crossing. Closure lands on-page with cost: she relinquishes identity and expends the last moonlight to integrate the shards and step through. Spatial and procedural beats cohere without causality gaps. The final cadence reweights all prior motifs without backfilling exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean and legible: rain → pools as map → dig → pavilion → orb → subsumption → dawn emergence. Closure lands on the page with cost as he takes in sorrow and reconfigures it, and the lens holds. Orientation is strong from the first lines. The only drag is the lack of a complicating turn; success arrives without a meaningful obstacle beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: hearing the “talks” → repairing/tuning → broadcasting → communal response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the tower-chime reborn as multilingual broadcast) with a conceptual cost (dismantling silos, surrendering separateness). Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the pattern is taught and paid off. The cost is more implied than felt, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative/textural build is clear: moonlight, fractures, quakes, and repeated visualization tighten toward a dawn reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early; causality is internal but legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (he redefines his role and pockets the mirror), though the cost is more implied than felt. The lens holds, with a measured cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages are clean: inversion begins → threshold effects engaged → seeds awaken → doodle‑barrier employed → orb taken → escape as gravity normalizes. Closure is a Decisive Change (she exits with the orb), though the cost on the final beat is modest. Orientation is strong early and the one‑scene structure holds without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from hush to hum through iterative adjustments. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when/stakes). Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the silence isn’t shattered but “enriched,” and the final image reweights the world’s rules. Cost is felt rather than explicit, enough for this scope but not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the nexus’s rising hum and the moon’s “next phase” narrow the window while Elias layers correlations until a vow crystallizes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he chooses return without vengeance, reweighting exile and covenant. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). The cost is soft but legible as relinquished grievance and acceptance of scarred self.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a mounting sequence of tuned silences—betrayal, loneliness—culminates in the brother’s confession and a reweighted final image with fireworks. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s listening retrieves a confession and reframes his peace as empathic attunement rather than avoidance. Cost is emotional and relational, legible in tears and the mended rift; modest but sufficient at this length. Orientation is crisp early; single-scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coherently builds from intention to experiment to communal reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: repulsion becomes revelation, and the village adapts rather than flees. The decisive communal choice is summarized rather than dramatized on the page, softening the felt cost. Orientation is strong early, and causality holds without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: inversion hits → follows water → grotto → relic → escape as gravity normalizes. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the live clock supports momentum. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (she secures the relic that can save the orchard), though on‑page cost is moderate and convenience edges in at the relic’s appearance. The causal lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with a light accumulative texture—survey → wind data → convergence → patch reframes causation → resolve to report. Orientation is clean from the outset; the beats link logically and culminate in a conceptual reconfiguration. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR rather than a decisive act, with cost implied by the silenced city. Slight softness remains because the on‑page price to Mara is conceptual more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative design is clean: the score guides strikes → density of sound/light → culminating chord → release. Orientation is immediate (who/where/aim), and the ending provides on‑page closure as the spirits are unfettered and the hush reconfigured. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized; the ritual doesn’t force a hard trade or loss, which tempers impact. Still, the cadence shift at the climax lands under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual’s preparation and sound density tighten until the visions deliver a reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—she endures painful revelations and alters her objective (alliances over isolation). Orientation is firm early and the causal chain (markers → uncase → play → visions → decision) is coherent. The price is internal rather than external, but it is legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: prints escalate, the halo intensifies, borrowed selves complicate, and the star-clock tightens. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “emotions... dynamic functions” with the starless void charging the realization with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught and paid off. Causal steps are legible within the lyric mode and culminate without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds from approach to exchange to aftermath, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration: her satchel lighter, legacy handed forward. Causality is clean (she recalls Thorne’s line → offers pendant → encounter lengthens → reweighted meaning). Orientation is clear from the outset, and the final image carries conceptual and practical cost. The quiet cadence shift at dawn lands closure without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush, frost patterns, and prism intensify toward a cadence shift as the car “exhales,” culminating in Marcus’s changed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he leaves altered; the hush lifts. Cost is present (Marcus confronts pain and relinquishes certainty) though understated. Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure is cohesive with no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density and pressure build from discovery to ritual to dissolution. Closure lands on the page with clear cost—her essence fades as the conduit launches, an Earned Stasis/RR. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal thread from found edges to woven bridge is coherent. The single scene tightens once meaningfully at the ritual recommencement.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.7)
    Drive lens: Causal. The because/therefore chain is intact—Elar acquires silk, descends via shafts, performs a ritual, guardians rise, orchards revive—culminating in a Decisive Change. Closure lands clearly, but the on‑page price is soft; the barter of “silence” lacks a concrete sacrifice. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds together.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean causal chain: shard → redirect → overheard intel → further redirect → confrontation → return with resolve. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: she learns the withheld truth and chooses to bear and act on it. Some convenience (overheard exposition, swift confession) softens cost, but the throughline remains coherent under a causal lens. Stakes return to the opening setting with a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal spine: lamp fails → hauntings intensify → he adapts the stone-letter method to the spectral realm → ghosts calm → lamp relit. Orientation is immediate (skipper, isle, lighthouse), and the scene holds a single stake and window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the living chain now includes the dead, with a continuing-duty cost. Hybrid lens (textural buildup with causal acts) holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the ritual intensifies toward a conceptually reweighted final image (shadows woven into renewal) with her laughter foreshadowing a blackout. Closure reads as conceptual repricing/charged poise more than decisive change; cost is implied rather than dramatized. Orientation is clean and the scene holds one coherent throughline. A sharper on‑page price at the end would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of sun trails → carvings → orb coherently deepens toward a conceptual repricing: who draws stories and why. Orientation is immediate and stable; the tea house pattern is taught early and followed. Closure lands with a before/after insight, though the on-page cost is largely conceptual rather than pressurized. Causality holds; no teleports or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: sound → discovery → repair in moonlight → measuring sorrow → map → revaluation and emotional shift. Under an accumulative/textural lens, density and patterning intensify toward the final conceptual repricing (trees witness resilience), which lands on page. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the sextant’s healing rule recurs functionally. The cost at closure is soft but legible as long-haul grief recalibrated rather than neatly erased.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual builds coherently: window → song → swaddling → woven light → communal reconnection → dawn. Closure lands on the page with a decisive world shift and a felt (if not severe) cost. Orientation is strong early (who/where/why), and the pattern taught is kept. A hair more resistance or a cost paid would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: beats accrue from invitation → entry → hiding → temptation to confront → anonymous aid → exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forgoes confrontation and reframes the mistake into present action at cost. Orientation is clean early; the live clock and betrayer’s speech tighten pressure. Slightly low external stakes keep it below top band, but causality and cadence hold.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate and clean; the scene progresses causally from tea to planting to discovery to ritual, then a brief earned coda. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mosaic’s unveiling shifts the courtyard’s social meaning and Elias’s stance. The cost is primarily conceptual—atoning for long neglect—yet present on the page. The lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative texture supporting a causal turn at the mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres as density and urgency increase toward the final, fracturing vow. Orientation is clean from the opening and the causal chain is steady: fading illusions → sampling → weaving into vials → sealing as the last shimmer dies. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she preserves fragments while accepting irrevocable loss. The cost is legible on the page (“trembling” as the last illusion dissolves).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: each false start complicates, delays, and channels Thorne to the final pressure point where Elara seeds doubt and records the break. Orientation is firm early (under‑pier market at night until sunrise), and the beats link by because/therefore. Closure lands on‑page with the audible fracture and the shipment’s abandonment. The cost is largely borne by Thorne and the deal, with Elara’s personal price felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory cues and motifs (taste, aurora, ring) intensify until the face‑to‑face answer and the bittersweet final taste. Closure functions as Conceptual Repricing/Earned softening of skepticism with a tangible image (her own mini‑gust). Orientation is crisp early (year, place, goal) and causality is clean: ring → guidance → encounter → reweighting. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: laughter fades → finds broken lock → recalls vow → builds hidden mechanism → retrieves chest → resumes art. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the broken lock/payoff loop lands. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change into renewed creation), with a felt emotional cost. Escalation is modest but coherent, avoiding coincidence-based resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong Causal lens: discovery of the map → verification with a lie‑sensing leaf → descent → zinc plate unlocking → orb activation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with clear emotional cost, and each step arises logically from the last. Orientation is clean and the stakes coherently focus on retrieving lost conversations. A slight convenience aura around the vault’s existence prevents a higher mark.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → building → attunement → activation builds density toward a charged final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the sculpture becomes a beacon; her seasonal silence births something enduring. Cost is present conceptually (risk of wonder’s fade, her winter muteness, labor in hostile height) and the wind/depths motif pays off. The scene’s orientation is solid and pattern‑teaching is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: geomagnetic reversal exacerbates inner static → fears leak → containment and controlled burn → escape. Closure is decisive and on the page, with cost (damage to dome, fire risk, departure) and a before/after in Elara’s integrated state. Lens: Causal, held through to the final image. The plan unfolds smoothly, bordering on convenient competence but stays earned by set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: locket → elders’ stories → tree key → mailbox opened → letters read. Closure lands on the page with the community’s reconfiguration and Elena’s softened grief. The cost is primarily emotional and communal, not deeply personal or risky, but it’s legible. Structure holds as a linear quest with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is clear early (sunken lab, hangman’s dice, journal method), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through patterned rolls and dances to a decisive unlock. Closure lands with an on‑page change (hatches open; digital consciousnesses freed; surfacing). The cost is primarily accrued over time (isolation, risk of “doom” on wrong rolls) rather than crystallized at the final beat, which softens impact. Still, causal threads are consistent and payoff honors the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to a charged-poise ending: whale → gravity surges → coffee reading → map → resolve to retrieve. Orientation is clear early; the two-shard flow (dock to chamber) stays coherent. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—memories as gravity repositories—with a felt, if understated, cost as he commits to face what he chose to erase. The cost could be sharpened by one concrete forfeit or risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: ritual prep → mapping → wing placement → dipping → hush descending. Orientation is crisp early, and closure lands on the page with a before/after shift. Cost is present but soft (identity/drive cooling), and the scene lacks a complicating turn. Still, the pattern intensifies and resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture): sugar → lessons → seal → rooftop → interrogation → confession → activation. Closure lands on the page when the seal is pressed and the building speaks, reweighting their “agreed lies” into operative truth (Conceptual Repricing). The cost is present but soft—trust and epistemic risk more implied than dramatized. Structure holds to two shards with one transition and a coherent tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the build is coherent: shell murmurs → hum → petal resonance → archiving at the last‑star threshold. Closure lands on the page (the shell falls silent; the garden unshadows) with a felt, if gentle, cost (relinquishing the haunting plea and her hedge of skepticism). Orientation is clean and the single‑scene window holds. Slight softness in cost keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Hybrid lens (causal action within an accumulative, lyric frame), the beat progression is clean: sanctuary → warded chain → insight about key → unlocking → retrieval → internal release. Closure lands with the vault opening (Decisive Change) and the forgiveness (Resonant Reconfiguration). The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than materially tested on the page, keeping intensity modest. Orientation is clear early, and setups (thorn, key, aurora) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: shell cue → forked path → Thorne’s reveal → uniting shells → revelation → song to free echoes. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a conceptual repricing of the echo premise. Costs are present but light; Thorne’s possession of the other half feels convenient. Orientation is strong and the single-scene structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp, and the accumulative build—shrine → globe → visions → log → plan—holds coherence. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to a method that preserves fragile peace while exposing injustice. The cost is present but soft, more conceptual than felt on the page. Causality is clean with no major gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and patterned motifs (nets/whisk/paths/fireflies) intensify toward a quiet closure. Orientation is clean early, and the scene remains continuous with one deepening when the whistling reframes perception and leads to the vow. Closure is a conceptual repricing/charged poise: he descends with a new mandate. The cost is modest but legible as a quiet rebellion against communal pragmatism.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: rumor → orchard anomaly → discovery of box → shredded letters reassembled → scientific explanation → pocketing the diamond. Orientation is strong and the lens stays causal. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: he leaves with the diamond, burdened by a truth that can save or doom. The price is largely conceptual/ethical rather than dramatized on the page, softening the impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: signals accrue, listeners gather, confluence arrives, and he declares a reweighted allegiance, turning the observatory into a beacon. Orientation is clear early; the pattern (radio fragments → revelations) is taught and maintained. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing image, with cost suggested by isolation and damage to the portico. The cost is not sharply dramatized on the page, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dawn’s whistle → music box → jar release → reweighted soundscape, culminating in a purposeful final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the melody’s sorrow sweetened by grandfather laughter, with a conceptual cost anchored in loss and solitude. Orientation is crisp early, and the single‑scene structure is clean. The cost is felt but subtle, limiting a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: rumor → approach → retreat to chamber → vibrational barrier → intruder’s absolution → flight of others → reflective afterbeat. Closure lands on page with a felt reconfiguration (threat dissolved; Elias’s own guilt stirred). The mechanics are briefly expository but coherent; the confrontation resolves a touch quickly for the built stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: early freeze isolates; rain activates the viaduct; moon-path mapping enables the covert signals; at zenith they act. Closure lands with the sending of signals (a clear on-page change) and a quiet, charged final image. Cost is mostly conceptual—choosing patience over immediate action—so the ending is strong but not searing. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: observation → patterning the hum → incantation/anchor → shattering influence. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the scene holds as one continuous window. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change; the cost is conceptual/emotional rather than concrete, limiting impact. The resolution tilts a touch easy, but linkages hold without teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene coherence holds: confrontation → admission → shared reading lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. The closure is on-page (music box springs to life; decision to forgive/atone) and situational pressure drives it. Stakes stay focused on forgiveness versus accountability without soft resets. A symbolic coincidence (anonymous clockwork heart) remains motif-level, not a causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine (relic → kaleidoscope decoding → sonic blueprint → gong) holds cleanly. Orientation lands early: who/where/what is clear, and the sequence coheres. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the bell’s frequency alters the world and options, implying danger (leviathans) and a before/after. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative motifs; the 47 pattern → lie → hidden node → self-erasing logs → scramble → bittersweet exit forms a clean chain. Orientation is early and solid; the AI overseer and forbidden subroutine set credible constraints. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: truth gained, evidence lost, leaving a charged final image with cost. Minor convenience in the breadcrumb’s neatness, but it’s established and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mirror‑by‑mirror process deepens pressure and consolidates purpose toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when anchored), and the lighthouse-to-attic progression is coherent. The ending’s decisive reconfiguration—orb complete, Council horn sounding, commitment to act—lands, though the felt cost is modest. Causality is intact: her empathy-driven method produces a tool that reweights options before the verdict arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the marina work, capsize, and gale layer pressure until a charged poise moment where patience “folds” into acceptance. Closure lands on the page with a reweighted final image (wind as solace; parasol tip as talisman) and a felt cost (renouncing the sought exit, living with altered perception). Orientation is clean early; the scene window is continuous with one intensifying transition to the storm night. The cost could be marginally sharper in concrete consequence, but the RR is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset; the accumulative/situational lens holds as the night becomes a container for exchange and reweighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “Perhaps mismatches…” reframes loss into charged connection under the dawn bus constraint. The cost—choosing meaning over togetherness—is legible though quiet. Causality is simple but coherent: missed bus → pavilion refuge → shared artifacts → reprice “mismatch.”

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece coheres from pavilion → clearing → parapet → ritual with a quiet cadence shift at the consecration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the wisdom bound to stone—and is on‑page, though cost is soft. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds (prophet arrival → conjured clearings → access to parapet → consecration). The lack of tangible opposition limits the sense of decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring arcs/vines accrete toward a Charged Poise closure in the mural and shared release. Orientation is clean early; cause/effect is soft but coherent. The visible cost is communal—the surfacing of grief—paid in the sessions and reweighted by the mural’s unveiling. Minor softness in decisive turns keeps it below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the crystal’s fractured echoes accrete into a pattern, leading to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the scene stays continuous. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/CR—returning the crystal and choosing a quiet mode of sharing—though the cost remains largely conceptual. The because/therefore chain is soft, but the cadence shift is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pathfinding ritual accretes into a charged poise: he locates the nexus, frames it, listens, and accepts the return of longing. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with cost—his curse persists; the chalk crumbles; the tide of longing will return. The because/therefore is gentle but coherent (fog → markers → clearing → sealing circle).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; tremors, spinning hand, and oak/leaf pattern densify into a final cadence shift. Closure lands on the page with the clock’s decisive change and the final photograph (RR with elements of DC). Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; the physical peril never exacts an on‑page price, slightly lowering impact. Orientation is strong from the outset, and set‑ups (leaf, cameras, clock) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hymn of mundane details accrues until the decisive cadence shift—Elara summons the daughter and yields the song. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: a peaceful goodbye replaces the earlier dirge, with the shard returned and options meaningfully altered. The holo‑call risks convenience but is paid off as Elara’s prepared tactic, not a deus ex machina. Stakes and cost are legible at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each “closed loop” triggers awakenings that lead to the Noon Veil reveal; the master loop functions as a clear tightening and payoff. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a legible cost: she must confront her lost shadow to enter. The cost is conceptual rather than felt in-scene, mildly limiting the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear causal chain: discovery of the substitute body → entry into the maze → tooth on pedestal → ritual → vision/forgiveness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes loss and mends the “cleft in certainty.” The cost is conceptual—letting the old pursuit of certainty dissolve—though it’s felt more in image than friction. A touch more on‑page resistance would have deepened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats accrete: choosing the sea glass, patient polishing, the weighing turn, and the release that reconfigures the premise. Orientation is clean from the opening, and a visible constraint (no fire) shapes tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost (accepting earthbound limits, renouncing blaze). The causal thread is soft but coherent for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density builds to a charged reconfiguration when Elara offers the pendant. Orientation is crisp early: who, where, when (post‑viral confession) and why she’s here. Closure lands on the page with cost—the heirloom’s weight is shared, changing the relational state and reweighting the past. The icicle‑pattern breadcrumb that brings the man coheres the scene’s causal thread without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence: three cameo harvests escalate pressure, then a decisive act reconfigures options. Closure lands on-page with cost as he sacrifices the shell and emerges “reborn,” satisfying Decisive Change with a resonant reweighting. Orientation is clean and the rules are taught through action. Minor risk: the ethical conflict is summarized rather than tested by a failed attempt, but it doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the structure holds as a single accumulating ritual scene. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern intensifies (hush → hum → song → second song) to a Decisive Change: the blight recedes and the arbor renews. The closure lands cleanly but with minimal on-page price; success arrives without a concession, loss, or visible foregone path. The live window (harvest moon at dawn) keeps shape, yet the cost-light finish nudges this below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural: the ritual accrues through precise acts until the eclipse peak, where the sealing reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page—the plate becomes a luminous map—with a felt cost (patience under brutal cold, charged grief). Orientation is crisp from the first line; single scene; one dominant goal. The only limiter is low resistance: the path proceeds smoothly, reducing pressure on the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through dawn/noon/dusk studies to a resonant reconfiguration: the repaired timer enables a harvest that will sustain him later. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/season), and causal continuity holds. Closure lands with a clear before/after—the device hums, echoes are captured, he emerges with a changed option set. The on‑page cost is time and solitude across the wounded season, felt but not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Causal. Setups (lamp, starlight, orientation) pay off in the precise ritual that yields stones and culminates in weaving herself to calcify the trap; the because/therefore chain is clean. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: “The infinite recursion snapped,” with a conceptual cost signaled by embedding her essence. The orientation (who/where/when) is crisp early, and the dawn clock tightens options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, tools, and kettle time build pressure toward a charged poise at the whistle. Closure lands on the page—the tea pour and half‑carved lion lock a before/after stance (contain grief by shaping it). Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the price—living with the unfixable while refusing denial—is legible. The single tightening (kettle’s approach) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: fragments → apparition → negotiation → reweighted stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as regret becomes catalyst and options reconfigure (carousel hints movement). Orientation is intact early; stakes cohere around the reckoning. The cost is felt but soft, more conceptual than dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: arrive → discover sextant → diagnose failed hydro → improvise redirection → systems revive → charged final image. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the set‑ups (star maps, conduits, carnival debris) pay off. Closure lands with a concrete change (the filtration/hydroponics awakening) and a conceptual reweighting from ruin to renewal. The on‑page cost is modest, keeping it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure mounts through the crystals’ whispers, tactile contact, and an intensifying recall until the cadence shifts to acceptance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he forecloses the fantasy of the pure composer while reweighting his chosen craft with music. Orientation is clear from the outset; cost is palpable on the page. The structural arc is modest but coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive holds: causal beats (obstruction → dive → chest → forgeries) culminate in a conceptual repricing at dawn. Closure lands on the page with cost—accepting the vault as a lure and pivoting his life’s method. Orientation is clean early; single scene window fits the length. The convenience of the obstruction is noted but doesn’t break escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-scene structure holds cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens: density and patterning build to the weaver’s appearance and the trade. Orientation lands early (Elias, dock, snow, fog) and causality is legible: decode → coax → weaver arrives → gift exchanged → enchanted seed. Closure reads as an earned reconfiguration with on-page price (endurance, surrendering the glass). The beat progression is purposeful, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds through ritual focus to a reweighted understanding (CR/Earned Stasis). Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the thread object stitches beats together cleanly. Closure lands on the page with cost—he remains alone, altered by acceptance. The turn is subtle rather than dramatic, but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene structure with steady tightening from assembly to activation to hatching lands cleanly, with a visible cost (imperfect revival). The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases (quakes, glow, runes) and the cadence shifts decisively at the hatch. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks. Some beats echo rather than turn, but the closure still reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual action accretes until the sapling sings, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean from the outset; cause flows sensibly from objects and place. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—proof that scars can sing—though the on‑page cost is largely conceptual/emotional rather than actively contested. The scene keeps one locus, one stake, and a coherent cadence shift at the song.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens: Causal. Breadcrumbs → test/hum → atrium/box → warmth/pressure points → pop → projections/fountains revive: the chain is clean and motivated. Closure is a decisive change with on‑page action and a visible price in time and attention. Orientation is clear early; no teleporting props. The cost is present but not heavy, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation and through‑line are clear: prepare, transit via sonar/gear, arrive, illuminate, and reweight patterns. Closure lands as a Charged Poise image—the sprouts “begin to unfold differently”—with conceptual cost (risk of interference, refusal of fire) implied more than dramatized. The causal chain is soft but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions (ribbon, retracing, butterflies) layer toward a reweighted understanding of grief. Orientation is immediate (greenhouse at dusk; carver at work) and the spectral mentor’s arrival catalyzes the sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/partial conceptual repricing when Elias shifts from names to abstract carvings charged by communal ritual. The cost is felt more than explicit, but the foreclosing of mere inscription is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds toward the pendulum’s pause and the transfer moment as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the closure occurs on the page. Cost is primarily emotional and a little asserted (“the village below…would feel it”), softening the punch. Still, the on-page act reweights the premise with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is clear from the outset (cemetery, cobalt silo, midnight), and the causal chain holds: find case → decode tapestry → map → grave → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the echoes are resolved and reweighted by placing the case, with dawn as cadence shift. The cost is largely conceptual/emotional, not material, which slightly limits impact. Accumulative texture dominates, coherently carried to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres toward a Charged Poise closure: the suspended instant before the pen touches the page reweights the stake. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single scene ascends to a clear final image. Cost is suggested (precision’s peril, societal weight) rather than dramatized, keeping the closure strong but not exceptional. The causal spine is minimal but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned motifs (mist, ember, dial glow, lyrics) build to a resonant reconfiguration as dust “learns” to retell. Orientation is clean early; single POV and scene coherence are solid. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—the world’s narrative ecology changes—though cost is implied (patrols) rather than paid. The sequence (discover, devise, broadcast, dust enacts) reads coherent if low on on‑page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the rocking chair’s slowing, the powdering, and the scattering cohere into a clear closure unit with cost (self‑erasure, acceptance of impermanence). Orientation is clean from the first lines; single scene cadence tightens toward the vanishing point release. The price is legible on the page, especially with the chair “forever still” and Elias fading. Minor exposition about the gallery’s secret verges on telling but doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Situational/Accumulative: the methodical descent culminates in discovery, which reconfigures meaning and options. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: he commits to forging truth via the cog, rejecting both narratives. Cost is implied rather than fully dramatized, keeping the turn solid but not devastating. Orientation and causal throughline remain clear within one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural lens is clear: gatherings build, a storm-night breakthrough lands, and the final image reweights the premise with a felt (if quiet) cost. Orientation is firm from the outset; time’s passage is legible and coherent. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration—tentative harmony with fragile endurance—rather than a decisive change, but it’s on the page. The causal throughline is light yet consistent with the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation, sequence, and stakes are clean: alignment peaks, pruning concentrates power, fruit is eaten, and perspective shifts. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive act (biting the fruit) and a clear after image (the haven’s quiet spread). Cost is present but largely internal and brief. The lens is primarily accumulative/textural and holds through the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal—blackout → hive failure → riddle → ascent → lacquer box → restoration. Orientation is clean from the outset, and setups pay off (matchbox, apex, artifact). Closure is a decisive change on the page, though the cost is lightly implied (finite wonder). Minor omniscient slips about Thorne’s motives don’t break causality, but the ease of the final act softens consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece tightens from observation → displaced objects → ritual → realization, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of “alive houses.” Orientation is clean early; causality within the lyric frame holds. The closure lands, though the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: Liriel’s instruction → Elara threads ampoule → cascading revelations reweight her stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with felt cost (reconsidering her father and her worldview). Orientation is clean and single‑scene. The because/therefore chain holds without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: resolve to disprove, methodical proof, Q.E.D., tremor, door. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a felt conceptual cost (freedom may be another loop). The hybrid causal/accumulative build holds consistently and the final image pays off set‑ups. No orientation debt; single‑scene focus remains tight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: inscriptions and daydreams accrete toward a charged dawn decision. Orientation is clean, single-scene coherence intact, and closure lands with a credible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (scroll finished, plan to seed the city). Cost is implied rather than dramatized in a sharp dilemma, but the cadence shift at dawn functions. No causality gaps; the set-ups (brush, moonwater, languages) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, the because/therefore chain is clean: beekeeper’s absence and frozen spring → historical plan of bread initials → ovens piped to spring → thaw and communal reconnection. Orientation is immediate (grotto behind waterfall; Elara’s role; resources dwindling). Closure lands on the page via the ice cracking and water trickling, with a modest felt cost in expended resources and fragility acknowledged. The plan resolves the central pressure without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: low tide exposes the yoyo; reverse‑engineering reveals the hunger stone; syncing clocks enables activation; the lighthouse beam reverses. Closure lands as a charged poise: the world begins to unwind even as he fears the victory is an illusion charged by the stone’s warning. Cost is conceptual and felt, though not materially dramatized. Orientation is clean and the single‑window structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: return → advisor’s method → paradoxes → cursed photo escalation → fear manifests → exposure dissolves it. Closure lands on the page with cost (unbearable self‑revelation, embodied nausea) and a decisive change (fear unravels; advisor disappears; Elias exits altered). Orientation is anchored early, and the method’s rules are taught through action. The solution comes swiftly but remains motivated by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres from cloud omens → preparation → sonic counter. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—the tide harmonizes instead of shattering—but the cost reads as risk and exertion more than a felt loss. Orientation is clean and the throughline holds. A single, effective cadence shift at crest provides satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: research → deciphered path → forbidden crack → scroll revelation → whistle call → watchers stir → departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost and narrowed options. Orientation is clear early and the lens holds. The scroll is an efficient but slightly expository device rather than an embodied confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the petal drop tightens time, discovery of the chest deepens knowledge, and the ending fixes a stance (book as method). Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing—shedding illusions via final petal/ivy image—though cost is modest. Orientation is clear early; scene unity holds. The lack of concrete resistance keeps the structural pressure elegant but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture that culminates in a charged physical act: retrieving the locket and sealing it with a note into the foundation. Orientation is clean from the opening, and beats follow because/therefore logic (survey → write → search → wrest → embed). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (secret entombment, ethical trespass, personal binding). Stakes are modest but coherent and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a causal lens, the blackout traps her, forcing analog methods, which enable the alternative hypothesis and discovery; beats connect cleanly. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: founders as refugees reweights her identity and the city’s myth. Cost is present but largely conceptual; stakes deepen rather than break. Orientation is strong from the outset, and scope stays tight.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: grief and shadow loss → build specialized lantern → journey to basilica → polish gem with recorded dreams → fold and release cranes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: peace is gained but the detached shadow remains as cost. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph and the lens holds. No teleports or patching; all setups (amethyst, basilica) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative textural build supported by causal steps: perturb, observe anomalies, chase clusters, pinpoint the ultimate pool. Closure lands as a charged poise: systems reboot forecloses further action while he commits to renewal, a stance with implied cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the cooldown window and reboot serve as concrete constraints. The cost is more implied than dramatized, but it’s legible in the foreclosed window and the vow’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: pilgrim arrives → incomplete chip → follow star trails → collect fragments → assemble → decode. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single-scene arc holds. Closure lands on the page with the chip activation and decoded frequency, though the cost is modest. The lens reads primarily causal with light lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual builds toward a resonant reconfiguration: he resolves to bear the truth and stop self‑deceit. Orientation is clean (terrace → shore → terrace), and the watch‑hand discovery functions as the tightening beat. Cost is legible in the acceptance of enduring guilt and the foreclosed path of pristine lineage. The watch hand’s “coincidence” skirts convenience but thematically reads as fated rather than cheap.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The scene is cleanly oriented early (who/where/when) and holds a Situational/Accumulative lens. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: exchange completed without incident, with a felt emotional cost acknowledged. Because/therefore linkages (prior failure → lunar synchronization → ritualized untethering) are intact. The lack of a sharper on-page obstacle limits the decisive turn’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: the story builds from dawn hesitation to a concrete pivot—walking inland, counting poles—with a quiet, legible closure. Causality is clean and anchored; set‑ups (compass, launch, poles) pay off. The cost is felt but modest, more symbolic than tested. Still, the before/after is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal breadcrumbs (newspaper misprints → coordinates → tunnel → “left is illusion/right is revelation” → lever → chute → lake) produce a coherent progression. Closure lands on the page with cost: he relinquishes the talisman and accepts regret. A minor contrivance in the newspaper‑cipher mechanism strains plausibility but doesn’t break the chain. The final reveal—that the “time traveler” is his pre‑procedure self—reconfigures meaning without mechanical overexplanation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: fortune → decision → spices ritual → involuntary metamorphosis → surrender → merger. Closure lands on the page with cost as she stabilizes into a hybrid and the bond is reforged. The Causal lens holds throughout, with no orientation debt. No late rule change undercuts the ending; the phoenix‑spice logic is seeded before use.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation and sequence are clean: trace hand → knot resists → saucer pressed → cloth unfurls → pool accessed. The closure (Decisive Change toward reconciliation) occurs on the page with visible cost (the crack widens, tears, blood). The causal chain is legible even within a lyric register, though the magical mechanics are accepted rather than contested. Stakes narrow at the knot, which functions as the central hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each stitch intensifies the pattern toward the portal’s opening, culminating in an on-page decisive change. Orientation is clear early: ship, archive, relics, task. The cost is primarily emotional (confronting grief/anger/loneliness) and is paid through action; it lands but could feel weightier. Causality stays intact with set-ups (photos/tear/console) paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative finish: causal beats (detour→rescue→release) build toward a conceptual repricing in the final image. Closure lands: he pays by giving up the bugs, new knowledge reweights his destiny, and the volcano calms on-page. Some resolution leans on coincidence (lever discovery, rune mechanics), softening causal rigor but remaining prefigured by his “orchestrating coincidences” trait. Orientation is clean and the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lens: Situational with causal threads—blackout pressure frames tactics; the loyal sentinel cameo tests stealth. Closure lands as Charged Poise: a poised revolution signaled by encoded projections, but the on‑page cost is minimal and no option is truly foreclosed now. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The scene tightens once (interruption), yet the decisive shift is deferred to off‑page dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through ritual density toward a conceptual repricing: not restoring friction but embracing the slide. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the closure cost is on the page (“her elusiveness waned… rooted yet free”). Beats cohere: discovery → hesitation under precog → ritual execution → pattern bloom → reweighted meaning. No causality breaks or soft resets undermine the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm cadence, timer, and envelope build toward a resonant reconfiguration where he reorients his poetics and tactic. Orientation is crisp early (observatory in a storm; censored poet alone) with one functional flashback to the bus shelter. Closure lands in the final sealing/wedging plan—continuing the covert chain—with a conceptual price (embracing risk and restraint). The cost remains implied rather than concretely confronted, keeping it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal throughline holds: waiting → contact → proof via sundial → interruption → duel → exchange completed. The decoding step is swift but motivated and paid off; the duel escalates and resolves without coincidence solving the problem. Closure is a decisive change: he parts with the artifact and obtains the maps. Cost appears on-page (relinquishing the card), though the musical overture’s impact is more told than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, one continuous scene with a purposeful backstory shard tied to the tin; orientation is crisp from the outset. The accumulative/textural lens holds: images and ritualized actions accrue toward a Charged Poise closure (“vow” under moonlight) with conceptual cost (defiance under tyranny, Jax’s execution). Causal threads (tin → contents → planting → vow) are coherent, if quiet. The cost remains largely implied rather than tested on the page, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens with a strong causal spine: compasses → booth → reel → timed entry → return. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: the mended clock and steadied compasses against the acknowledged limit (“the reel couldn’t hold forever”). Cost is present (temporary reunion, solitude resumed), though lightly taxed. Orientation is clean early and the chain holds without cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive (causal actions within an accumulative lyric frame) holds: plant → trance/dream interpretation → spoken ritual → sprout measured against records → charged descent. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the collective memory stirs and the seed sprouts, with the looming monsoon and persistent doubt charging the cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when and stakes). The beat chain avoids teleports and pays off prior setups (dreams gathered; seed’s ritual conditions).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: found lace → ritualized steps → naming the hue → steadied compass → lighter body lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the sequence proceeds with because/therefore logic. The closure’s cost is modest (accepting ongoing sorrow rather than erasing it), but it’s legible in the final acceptance that the tides will return. No causality breaks or teleported props.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Excellent use of an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the plot advances through layered observation rather than a causal chain. The structure culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration on the page, with the cost of Elena’s former intellectual detachment made perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain: the testament leads to the frost, which, combined with the ledger, reveals the path to the box. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), re-contextualizing the family legacy with a felt cost rooted in her recent trauma. The plot is perfectly scaled for the word count, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean, causal chain from inciting incident to resolution, with a Decisive Change that lands with a clear emotional cost. The structure is effective and orientation is handled well. The primary weakness is the convenience of the solution; Elara stumbles upon the exact, perfectly preserved tools needed to solve a world-altering problem with no significant setbacks or complications, which softens the plot's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal structure, but a pivotal link is critically weak: the solution ("The method came to him in a dream"). This deus ex machina undermines Elias's agency in solving the central problem. While the closure is a clear Decisive Change for the library, the cost to the protagonist—simple exhaustion—is low, lessening the impact of his successful undertaking.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story employs an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and reflection rather than a causal chain. The orientation is clear, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the community's social contract—lands with the felt cost of lost anonymity. The narrative arc is coherent and complete within its scope, successfully moving from a state of hidden support to one of open, declared solidarity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere toward a clear Decisive Change in Elara's internal state. The structure is sound for its length and the closure lands on the page. However, the cost of this change is too soft; while confronting the wound is implied to be painful, the actual healing feels like a frictionless release without a visible trade-off or sacrifice, weakening the "before/after" legibility of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for this length, moving from inciting incident to climax with clean causality under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The closure unit provides a powerful Conceptual Repricing—he gets the knowledge he sought but loses the tool—with the cost felt on the page ("the fragment's loss, the fading echoes"). This fulfills the 9+ quick test, as the price he pays directly shapes the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story operates on a clean, effective Causal lens. The plot structure is tight: setup, rising action, climax, and resolution are all executed clearly within the single scene. The closure is a Decisive Change (threat averted) that lands on the page with a clear, felt cost (Elias remains chained), satisfying the rubric's requirements for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is not causal but ritualistic, building in density toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The ending, where Elias hears the sound and finds release, provides a clear "before/after" internal state change with the palpable cost of re-experiencing the trauma, satisfying the closure requirement at the highest level for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and layering magical elements toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the close. The closure lands cleanly, with the reinterpretation of the portrait providing a new path and a felt cost (renouncing her old life). However, the causal chain relies on a significant coincidence: the stolen portrait just happens to contain a cipher that points to her exact location at that exact moment, which feels overly fated and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is excellent for an Accumulative/Textural piece. The rising water provides a clear external pressure that drives the narrative toward a firm deadline, and the setting's thaw provides a resonant parallel to the internal arc. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias steps out ready for the new world—is earned and lands on the page with a legible felt cost associated with abandoning the pain of his past.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The plot follows a clear causal chain under a Causal lens, and the closure is a decisive, on-page change with a felt cost. Orientation is handled well. The structure is weakened by the high convenience of its core discovery—finding his *own* childhood cast with a decryptable, perfectly relevant message feels less like earned causality and more like a convenient plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is exemplary for an Accumulative/Textural piece. It maintains a single, focused scene that builds pressure through the fading of the last star. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is executed perfectly on the page, with the final action of closing the booklet providing a resonant and costly final image that reconfigures the story's meaning. The narrative logic is flawless within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is elegant and contained, with the final realization about the origin of thought providing a resonant closure. The cost is the subtle but profound shift from a questing state to one of integrated wholeness, which is earned by the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure under a Hybrid lens that successfully shifts from Accumulative to Causal. The closure is a Decisive Change, achieved on the page with a legible felt cost (mutual vulnerability). All plot beats—finding the tickets, interpretation, confrontation, and resolution—are logically connected and serve the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal lens, and the closure provides a decisive change. The primary weakness is structural; for its length, the story functions as a compressed summary or montage spanning multiple days rather than a focused scene or two-shard sequence. This narrative compression weakens the dramatic immediacy of key events, such as the nightly mending, which are told rather than shown, making the plot feel outlined rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure (theory -> experiment -> consequence -> retreat) that is perfectly suited to the length. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (reversing the lever) that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara, with the felt cost being the near-disaster and the loss of access to the phenomenon. The plot is tidy, effective, and lands with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a dense atmosphere toward a resonant closure. Orientation is excellent. However, the causal link for the climactic action—Elias's sudden understanding that a *discord* is the key—feels like an unearned intuitive leap, weakening the crucial turn from a choice into a discovery. The closure itself, an Earned Stasis, is well-executed and lands with a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and symbolic objects toward a decisive internal shift. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elara's grief, lands cleanly on the page with a tangible felt cost ("the auroral sorrow of lost years"). The structure is spare, effective, and perfectly suited to the length, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a final image that reconfigures the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Situational) lens, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost. The orientation is solid, and the inciting incident (the confession) logically propels Alex into the tunnel. The primary weakness is the causality of the climax: the radio calls are a convenient coincidence, and their interpretation requires a suspension of disbelief that feels unearned, making the resolution feel more imposed than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and effective for its Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from library to refuge and back. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands clearly on the page, with the cost legible in the eternal, cyclical nature of his "crumbling peace." The origami swan provides a coherent, if fantastical, causal mechanism for the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective accumulative structure, moving from setup to a decisive intensification at the eclipse. The closure, Finn's emotional breakthrough, is earned and lands with a legible cost—Elara's vulnerable sharing of her own tragedy. The plot is propelled by Elara's agency in using the eclipse, turning a coincidental event into a deliberate therapeutic tool, which strengthens the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing where Elias's hope reconfigures the future's potential. The narrative arc is coherent and the closure lands with a clear conceptual cost—the burden of a new, monumental purpose. However, the plot proceeds via discovery rather than causal turns born from pressure, reading as a successful investigation more than a dynamic sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal structure with a clear inciting incident and an on-page closure that demonstrates a decisive change. The main weakness is the resolution's reliance on a fairy-tale logic, where entrenched social problems are solved instantly and harmoniously, which, while internally consistent, feels simplistic and mitigates the legibility of any true cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through layered sound and intensifying threat. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands cleanly with the reweaving of the anchor's stillness. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length, with a clear orientation, escalation, and a resonant, cost-bearing final image of quiet exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive lens, where the mapping of memories builds pressure toward the climax. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, as the "mirrored horizon had flipped time's arrow," and lands with the felt cost of exhaustion. The structure is simple, elegant, and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective, using an Accumulative/Textural drive that builds pressure through the failure of successive timelines. The framing device, "between the drop and the ripple," creates a taut, continuous present. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (becoming mortal) with a legible, deeply felt cost (loss of power and eternity), landing perfectly on the final page and satisfying the story's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density and atmosphere toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist, which lands with a felt cost on the page. Orientation is immediate and causality, under the chosen lens, is impeccable, progressing from private experiment to shared catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a clear closure. The ending is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias's refusal to engage forecloses a path with the felt cost of forgoing a potential alliance. The causal logic, under this lens, is impeccable and the final stance crystallization is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a Hybrid lens, leading to a Decisive Change with a legible, felt cost. The structure is effective for the length, but the "ultraviolet revealing method" is introduced conveniently, functioning as a mild deus ex machina that slightly weakens the plot's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is swift and clear. The narrative builds density through layers of memory, setting, and symbolic action, leading to a climax that feels summoned rather than stumbled upon. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias renounces a binary choice to preserve his quest, lands with a clear, felt cost, satisfying the lens's requirements at an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building atmospheric and sensory density toward a powerful climax. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a beautifully rendered Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the protagonist's vow crystallizes his worldview with a felt conceptual cost—the release of contained potential for ephemeral, ongoing beauty. The before/after state of the "chronic hush" is perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The single scene builds pressure through sensory intensification, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the completed transformation) with a clear, felt cost—the release of her former life and home.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from the discovery of the envelope to the final connection. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where a new bond is formed, is achieved on the page. However, the legibility of a true cost is weak; the resolution feels more like a seamless, positive outcome than a reconfigured state born from meaningful trade-offs or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails the fundamental scope requirement for its length, presenting a compressed summary of a longer narrative ("One twilight... As they searched... Finally... Years passed...") instead of a continuous scene or two focused shards. This "and then" structure weakens causality, replacing dramatized pressure with a montage. While the accumulative lens is clear and the closure lands thematically, the foundational structure is unsuitable for a short story, reading more like an outline.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates flawless causal logic under a Hybrid (Causal dominant) lens. The plot progresses from a clear inciting incident (dissonant notes) to a well-defined climax and resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change—uncaging the bird—that occurs on the page with a clear, felt cost in the risky act of borrowing time, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is flawless for this length, using an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds to a strong close. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is executed perfectly on the page; the vision reweights Elias's emotional state with the felt cost of continued ambiguity. The causality of the ritual is internally consistent and earned within the story's magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, adhering to a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) drive lens. The power outage serves as a perfect inciting incident, leading through a chain of sensory and memory-based discoveries to a Decisive Change at the end. The closure lands cleanly on the page with a felt, albeit temporary, cost: Elias forfeits his cherished invisibility to fulfill his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a Decisive Change with a felt cost. The structure is sound and well-paced for the length. The central causality is slightly undermined by the climax, where the solution arrives as a sudden "flash of insight" rather than an earned discovery through struggle, making the turning point feel more convenient than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure builds logically from isolation to a "convergence" of elements that reframe the protagonist's drive. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elias exchanges the personal relic for a shared story, is earned and lands with the felt cost of giving up his direct link to the past. The causality is more thematic than mechanical, which is appropriate for the chosen lens, and the final state is a legible "after."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure that culminates in a clear transformation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively; the shift from a clairvoyant of fixed paths to a conduit for possibilities is a legible before/after. The cost—the loss of certainty—is explicitly stated and felt in the final image, making the structure sound and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The final image of the humming harbor provides a legible "after" state, with the processed pain of exile serving as the felt cost. The structure is simple but sound, with orientation established early and the closure earned through the preceding beats of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The plot follows a clear and coherent causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from one discovery to the next logically within its magical framework. The story is well-oriented in time and place from the start. The closure is a Decisive Change where the protagonist confronts his past, and the emotional cost is made legible, satisfying the core structural requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, where memories are untangled with the felt cost of confronting grief, is legible and earned on the page. The structure is tight, and the internal causality is coherent and strong, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story exhibits a clean, effective causal structure. The orientation is immediate, the progression from inciting incident to climax is logical, and the closure lands as a Decisive Change with a legible cost—the shattered amulet and an incomplete revelation. The inferred Causal drive lens holds perfectly from start to finish, making the plot arc highly effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal structure is sound, and the story orients the reader effectively. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, but its impact is slightly undercut by the ambiguity of the ink's power at the climax—is it real magic affecting the officials, or just a metaphor for Alex's conviction? This wobble in the story's core logic prevents a higher score. The cost of the action (moral compromise) is legible but then rhetorically erased by the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where Elias realizes the town's silence is a deliberate containment, fundamentally reweights his entire project with a felt cost—the loss of his solitary peace for a new, urgent purpose. The structure is tight, focused on a single continuous scene that builds perfectly to this final, resonant shift.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, using the rhythm of the tides as a narrative pulse. The central deepening occurs with the discovery of the poison label, which perfectly connects the external search to the survivor's personal history. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the protagonist embraces their state with a clear, felt cost—social erasure—that is re-priced as a form of "quiet defiance."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear cost—the fading of the seashell—and the single-scene structure is well-maintained. However, the plot's central mechanism, using a conveniently found half-finished cello to channel spectral dialogues via humming, feels arbitrary and un-scaffolded, weakening the causal chain leading to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails the fundamental scope requirement for its length by presenting a summary of weeks of action ("As weeks passed") rather than a continuous scene or two focused shards. This synopsis structure substitutes telling for showing, weakening causality and tension. While the closure—a Charged Poise where the community's resolve crystallizes—is conceptually sound under an Accumulative lens, it feels unearned because the preceding struggle was recounted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the passage of time and intensifying atmosphere. The structure is clear, anchored by the timed chemical messages. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the photograph preserves the grain's legacy at the cost of its existence, landing with a well-earned, poignant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly constructed within the single-scene scope, demonstrating a clean and compelling causal chain under a Causal lens. The inciting incident, rising action, and climax lead to a Decisive Change that is earned and resonant on the page. The final image provides a strong sense of closure with a felt, if overcome, cost for the ship's crew, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirements perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is lean and effective, moving cleanly from stasis to a decisive commitment to action. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens is well-served by a closure of Charged Poise, where Elias steps onto the ice, crystallizing the stakes of his quest with a felt cost—the forfeiture of safety for the perilous unknown. The causal chain, while simple, is unbroken and leads to a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is coherent: a problem is established, a ritualistic solution is repeated, its effect gathers momentum, and it culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration of the town's state. The closure, where the "wild hush" becomes a "living whisper" and Thorne departs, provides a clear before/after with the felt cost of his transient nature. Causality operates effectively within this magical, rhythmic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, continuous scene with a well-defined closure. The drive is a hybrid of accumulative pressure (dwindling oxygen, isolation) and a causal final act. The closure is a potent form of Charged Poise: Elara achieves her goal, reconfiguring her desperation into triumph, at the clearly legible cost of her own life. The only minor weakness is the hand-waved causality of the scent working underwater via "arcane means."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but its causal logic is critically weakened by a late-breaking rule. The introduction of the "lighthouse's eerie attribute" to explain the ghosts feels like a convenient device to enable the climax, rather than a natural extension of the established world. While the final Resonant Reconfiguration lands, the mechanism that triggers it is not adequately prepared, reading as an unearned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot progresses through a series of vignettes that build pressure and advance the central goal. The closure is a clean and earned Resonant Reconfiguration, with the transformation of the orchard and the final departure of the ghost providing a clear "after" state with a legible cost (her permanent loss).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a transformed state through layered magical actions. The closure, a Decisive Change from ruin to reverence, is on the page but lacks a felt cost; the resolution is wholly positive, undercutting its dramatic weight. The sudden, convenient appearance of other perfectly synchronized sleepwalkers strains causality, reading as a serendipitous solution rather than an earned convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure where discoveries build logically toward the closure. The drive lens (Hybrid, leaning Accumulative) holds perfectly, with the final internal change feeling earned through the layered experiences. The on-page closure, a Decisive Change in her faith, has a clear felt cost in the form of confronting her past and the physical/emotional labor of the excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building thematic and emotional density toward a powerful final image. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise, with the final moment before mailing the letter crystallizing the stakes and reconfiguring Elara's role as a guardian, with the cost of rebellion felt against the backdrop of surveillance. The causal logic for this lens is impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent structural integrity under a clear Causal lens. Orientation is swift and effective, and the plot progresses through a clean because/therefore sequence. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the narrative's state with a palpable sense of risk and potential, making the cost of Elara's covert action felt without needing a decisive physical confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. It builds pressure through atmosphere and ritual, culminating in a clear climax and resolution. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's internal state and future options are reshaped with the felt cost of confronting her past. The structure is elegant, cohesive, and perfectly suited to the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight effectively within a single, continuous scene. The structure is sound, with clear orientation and pacing. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elena's internal state shifts with a felt cost—the transformation of her persistent "lotus-hearted ache"—making the before/after state legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is a single, coherent scene within the daydream, building atmosphere and internal meaning toward a clear closure. The ending provides a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s waking state is altered with a felt cost—the bittersweet awareness that joy is rediscovered, not relived—which is earned and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's structure is its greatest strength, correctly identified here as Accumulative/Textural. The nested awakenings create a coherent intensification of the central theme, and the framing device of the visitor's question provides a tight, effective container. Closure is achieved through a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the protagonist's worldview is fundamentally altered with the legible cost of her former certainty, making the ending both satisfying and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from setup to a Decisive Change at the end. The climax is a direct result of the preceding actions, and the closure lands with a clear cost (exposure, chaos). The mechanism of the gourd's power—described first as pheromonal, then executed as sonic—is a minor wobble, and its full power is revealed very late, slightly weakening the causal chain's inevitability but not breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is coherent: lullabies accumulate over centuries to achieve a magical effect. The closure—the lover's return—is a clear Decisive Change that resolves the primary stake. However, the cost is abstract ("centuries of longing") and the resolution feels too clean, like a wish granted rather than a victory earned through a final, costly struggle. The story lacks a sense of genuine peril or trade-off at the climax, softening the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, where the discovery of the cracked tube deepens the established emotional stakes rather than causing a sharp causal turn. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands effectively with a clear felt cost in the final lines, reconfiguring the meaning of Elara's endless task. The internal logic is flawless for this mode and length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean Causal drive lens, with each beat logically following from the last. The structure is tight and well-suited for the length, establishing stakes, executing the central action, and delivering a clear closure. The closure itself, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands effectively, reweighting the cost of their parting. The magical resolution, while thematically fitting, feels slightly convenient, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear and logical Causal chain, leading to a decisive on-page closure. However, the inciting incident—finding the surveyor's chain with its coded message—feels overly convenient, bordering on a deus ex machina. The resolution, while complete, is predicated on this lucky discovery rather than a series of choices made under escalating pressure, which lessens the earnedness of the final success.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, where symbolic actions build toward a psychological shift. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of what "preservation" means, lands with a clear, felt cost—the vulnerability of waiting for Aria's return. The plot is concise and every element, from finding the meteorite to the pigeon's return, serves this final reweighting of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The structure builds density through layered imagery—maze, wood grain, weather codes—culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elias re-frames his loss as an "essential" distance, lands with a palpable conceptual cost, fulfilling the requirements for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere toward a resonant final image. However, the closure mechanism feels arbitrary. The "method: a shared exhale" that resolves the climax is not foreshadowed or earned by prior causality, reading as a convenient mystical event rather than a discovery rooted in Elara's specific skills. The cost—the feather's softened char—is a legible on-page change, but its connection to the preceding action is conceptually weak, softening the impact of the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot structure is sound. Orientation is established immediately. The story progresses by deepening Elara's understanding through a series of accumulated insights, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end. The cost—the "gentle ache of what remains unseen"—is felt, making the closure earned and legible within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, Causal/Accumulative structure, with Elias's plan unfolding as intended. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as he successfully reinforces his purpose and prepares for the next iteration. While the structure is sound and the lens holds, the piece is held back by a near-absent sense of cost; the moment simply ends, which feels more like a feature of the performance than a price paid, slightly softening the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building density toward a powerful closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration—becoming anchored but transcendent—lands with a clear and felt cost (physical mobility). The structure is elegant, and the pivotal turn ("spontaneously anchored") functions as a perfect, earned consequence within the established ritualistic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds atmosphere and symbolic weight, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page as Elias finds a renewed stance, and the cost—the inevitable loss of the bay's serenity—is palpable. The plot is simple but structurally sound for its chosen mode and length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from setup to a central reflective scene and landing on a quiet closure. The final moment, where the box feels "lighter now, its burden shared," serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt cost for Mia. The inciting incident (meeting Mia) relies on coincidence, but within a textural design, this is acceptable as it enables the central thematic performance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through three successful trials toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end ("forged hope's new calculus"). The structure is sound and orientation is immediate. The primary weakness is the lack of a tangible on-page cost for the protagonist; the "upheaval" happens to other worlds, leaving Elara herself untested and unchanged by any personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain, but the climax hinges on a major coincidence. Finding the exact diaries and negative strip that perfectly mirror her specific internal conflict ("Silas... burdened by the legacy of denial") feels overly convenient, undermining the earnedness of the closure. The plot structure is sound, but its resolution relies on fortune rather than the protagonist's agency overcoming a final obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. It builds density through layered, purposeful details that all converge on the closure. The final image—a Charged Poise where the mirrors are transformed at the cost of the painter's existence—is earned, resonant, and lands with undeniable felt cost. Orientation is immediate and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric and thematic pressure toward a single, decisive ritual. The structure is clean and effective for the length, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change with a clearly legible cost (“a fragment of her vitality siphoned into the relic”). This is an excellent execution of a non-causal structure with a powerful, earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens, culminating in a Decisive Change with a clearly articulated cost. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length. A minor deduction is warranted for the late, slightly convenient introduction of "ancient shamans" to explain the egg's magic, which feels like a small patch on an otherwise solid causal framework right before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. It maintains a single, continuous scene with clear orientation, building pressure through layered description rather than causal turns. The closure—a Decisive Change where the voices are released—lands with a clear, on-page impact and a potent felt cost (the court's impending wrath), fulfilling the requirements for exceptional structure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and effective for the story's length, following an Accumulative/Textural drive that culminates in a Decisive Change. The closure—a Charged Poise where Elias commits to his new path—is on the page, and the cost is clearly felt in Lena's catalytic absence. The internal causality is sound, moving from external pressure (the argument) to internal reflection and a reconfigured future, satisfying the core requirements of a complete narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. It builds atmospheric and thematic density toward a single, decisive cadence shift—the butterfly's arrival. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where Elias’s role is reconfigured from orchestrator to witness, with the felt cost of his shattered, self-made harmony. The narrative logic is impeccable under its chosen lens, and the final image lands with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story presents a clean causal chain leading to a decisive, on-page change. However, the closure lacks a felt or visible cost paid *in the moment* of triumph; the primary cost (guilt) was resolved before the story began. This absence of a final price diminishes the dramatic weight of the otherwise successful resolution, violating the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, where atmosphere and symbolic discovery build toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page as Elara understands her place and steps into the storm. However, the causal link between finding the scroll and the specific content of the dream-epiphany feels convenient, relying on a mechanism that resolves the central question too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with the ritual's steps leading directly to the climax. Closure is achieved on the page as the covenant is sealed. However, the associated cost is weak and abstract; "the covenant's weight" is immediately framed as a "quiet triumph," which undermines the legibility of a genuine price being paid, a key requirement for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical single-scene structure under a Causal lens. However, the central mechanism of change—"cellular memory" triggered by a magic pin—is asserted rather than earned, functioning as a convenient magical solution that weakens the core causality. The closure is legible but feels predetermined from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot structure is lean and purposeful, perfectly suited to the story's length. It follows an Accumulative/Textural logic where atmosphere and internal state build towards a causal climax, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands effectively, with the final image of the captured dream demonstrating an earned change with a felt cost—the willing sacrifice of his rigid reality.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Situational/Causal) lens. The inciting incident (the slip) and climax (the bag's contents spilling) are causally linked and effective. The resolution, which relies on the happy accident of the notebook, is handled well within a situational framework, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing where the value of "persistence" is re-evaluated. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost to the protagonist's initial worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, following a single character through a revelatory scene that delivers a potent closure. The ending is a perfect example of a Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elias's understanding of his world and role is fundamentally reconfigured. The cost—eternal solitude and the risk of self-erasure—is made explicit and felt, satisfying the closure requirement with elegance under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each beat logically follows the last, from Thorne's arrival to the earned resolution. The closure is a strong Decisive Change for Thorne and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara, with the cost of the vow felt on the page. The plot is tightly constructed and perfectly scaled for the word count, with the central problem being solved through means established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building internal pressure to a clear Decisive Change at the end. The plot logic, within its fabulist frame, is coherent. However, the closure lacks a sharply felt on-page cost; the final release into the garden feels more like a seamless reward than a victory paid for in the climatic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens leading to a Decisive Change for its closure. The structure is sound, with a clear setup, inciting incident, and resolution. However, the cost of the climax feels thin; the risk of the door vanishing and the threat of being "overwhelmed" are stated but not viscerally felt, making the resolution feel slightly too neat and low-friction for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page with a clear conceptual cost: the old, easy silence is gone, replaced by a vigilant, "forged" peace. The plot is simple but effective for the length, with the ritual at the glacial chamber serving as a well-defined focal point that resolves the initial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a strong Causal lens with a clear, linear structure leading to an on-page Decisive Change. The primary weakness lies in the resolution's convenience; the retrocognitive vision provides the shard's exact location, which feels less like a discovery earned through struggle and more like an answer being supplied. While the cost is noted ("hands bleeding"), it feels gestural rather than deeply felt, slightly undermining the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot functions flawlessly as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building pressure through layered discovery rather than causal events. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the archivist's identity, lands with the legible cost of the whispers' final silence. A higher score is prevented only by a cross-category cap due to prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood and sensory detail toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is sound, with a legible before/after state for the protagonist. The discovery of a perfectly tailored mosaic message relies on a degree of coincidence that feels more allegorical than strictly causal, but it functions effectively within the story’s established tone and successfully triggers the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure hinges on the central pause, where tension and meaning accumulate through observation rather than causal events. The closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Kael's final words and gesture reframe the stakes with a clear, felt cost without needing a decisive action, fulfilling the lens's requirements with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot follows a clean, logical causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens. The Decisive Change at the end is legible and lands on the page, with the cost being the significant risk taken during the inversion. The introduction of "ancient scrolls" is a minor convenience, but the structure is otherwise tight and effective for this length, with the closure directly resulting from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift, and the single continuous scene builds pressure through atmospheric density rather than plot events. The closure—Mira's quieted state—is a Decisive Change that lands on the page with a clear, felt cost (vulnerability, acceptance of grief), making the before/after legible and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from setup to resolution, with a clear Decisive Change at the end. However, the closure lacks a sharply legible cost; "merging her essence" is an abstract price immediately followed by a purely positive outcome ("renewed harmony"). While the plot is structurally sound and avoids causality breaks, the lack of a tangible sacrifice or difficult trade-off at the climax makes the victory feel less earned and impactful than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a tight, effective causal structure for its length, moving from inciting incident to resolution without wasted motion. The inferred Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens holds, with a clear Decisive Change at closure: Lorin is healed and the threshold vanishes, foreclosing the path with a legible cost of finality. The plot mechanics are flawless, though the resolution feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive, with each event logically leading to the next. The structure is sound for its length, moving from inciting incident to a climactic action and resolution. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, but it lacks a sufficiently legible cost; the metaphorical pressure is embraced and immediately converted into reward, which softens the impact of the final triumph. A stronger sense of sacrifice or a lingering consequence would have elevated the resolution from satisfying to resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain under a Causal-dominant lens, culminating in a well-executed Conceptual Repricing where Elias re-understands his role. The closure lands with a legible cost ("the weight of it all"). However, the core mechanism of "auditory illusions" via "standing waves" functions as a somewhat convenient high-concept device, requiring significant suspension of disbelief without being fully earned by the story's physics.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clear Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances logically from discovery (the program) to decision (the ritual), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the knight becomes the orchard's guardian. The closure lands with a clear, symbolic cost (unsnapping the gauntlet, releasing his old identity), and the final image of a "dawn's illusion" provides a potent sense of a new state. The narrative lens is held consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) lens. The plot is propelled by a clear causal chain from discovery to decision. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing leading to a Decisive Change ("decided to digitize...brushing away the dust patterns to start fresh"), lands effectively with a legible, felt cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens and delivers a Decisive Change with a felt cost at the end. The plot structure is logical, but it relies on a significant coincidence for its primary turn: the map that "suggested itself" in the puddles. This convenience, which resolves the problem of where to go rather than merely complicating it, weakens the causal integrity of the narrative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the intensification of the prophecy versus the hush. The structure is clean and purposeful, moving from arrival to confrontation to resolution without wasted motion. The closure, an Earned Stasis where the prophecy is smothered, is achieved on the page with a clear emotional cost—the "nostalgia settling like dew on his soul"—which makes the ending resonant and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, successfully building a sequence of ritual actions toward a clear climax. The structure is sound for its length, and orientation is handled well. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration—lacks a strongly felt cost; the shift from an orderly world to "chaotic joy" is framed as a pure, frictionless gain, which lessens the impact of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot progresses logically from the inciting incident (the patterned clocks) to a Decisive Change at the climax. The closure, where Elias mends a clock by feel, lands with a clear "before/after" and a felt cost—the abandonment of his old, rigid self. The structure is flawless for this length, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean, using a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) drive that holds through to a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The final image lands with a clear emotional cost and transformation, fulfilling the core structural requirements for this length. The causality is symbolic and internal, which aligns perfectly with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual rather than traditional causal turns. The structure is clean: setup, ritual, confession, tonal shift, and release. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Thorne's soul is transformed, lands with a clear and legible emotional cost on the page ("a sound rusty and aching").

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through sensory intensification and memory recall. Orientation is established effectively after the initial, purposeful disorientation. The story achieves a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure, as the meaning of mercy and the pewter strap are reconfigured with the felt cost of confronting her own guilt, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building details toward a resonant final release. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively with a felt cost as the emotional weight lifts from Elara. The structure is coherent, but the causal progression relies on the convenient introduction of the alchemist and his immediate, direct solution, softening the plot's internal logic and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each beat logically following the last. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clearly felt, if internal, cost (the lifting of the "weightless burden"). The structure is sound for its length, but the causal chain feels slightly too convenient; the ghost points, Elias finds the exact right panel, and the object's function is immediately apparent, which slightly reduces narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, moving from a clear goal to a decisive, costly climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the perfect system is permanently flawed, lands with a legible conceptual cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the build-up of poetic actions creates a potent, internally consistent causality that makes the final shift feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift, and the plot progresses from problem (temporal distortion) to a single, decisive action (covering mirrors) that enables the resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elias's purpose, lands effectively with a clear felt cost—the "fragile victory" of shared, ancient sorrow. This is a very strong performance, just shy of exceptional due to its straightforward simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with each action logically leading to the next. The closure is a Decisive Change, but its impact is weakened by the lack of a tangible cost. The final victory, described as permanent ("reclaimed forever"), feels unearned because no lasting price is paid, which softens the overall structural integrity of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure that builds effectively toward a resonant conclusion. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands decisively on the page as Elara re-contextualizes her life's purpose. The cost is the forfeiture of a mundane path, now understood as freedom, making the ending feel earned and tonally coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, where the storm, the hum, and the visions build to a creative climax. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara leaves with a new tool and a deepened purpose. The magical causality is consistent, and the subtle cost—the weight of her new artistic responsibility—is felt in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building layers of meaning toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the revealed message provides a resonant closure with a clear felt cost ("Tears came softly"). The flashback structure, while extensive, successfully serves this accumulative goal, making the final moment in the pavilion a culmination of the entire journey.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean causal lens, leading to a Decisive Change for the protagonist (he's free and has the truth). Closure is earned on the page with a clear, felt cost—the lingering "embers" of the reverie. The plot structure is tight, efficient, and internally consistent, successfully executing its fantastical premise from setup to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a strong causal lens from the rejection of the bottle to the final action, culminating in a clear Decisive Change. The structure is sound and the closure lands with an earned feeling of hope. The primary weakness is the resolution's reliance on "Word spread somehow," which introduces a moment of convenient, un-authored causality that slightly undermines the otherwise meticulous, self-reliant revival arc established moments earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) lens, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's role shifts from archivist to creator. The structure is sound for the length, but the causal leap from memory immersion to literal, building-altering prophecy feels abrupt. The resolution is also slightly weakened by summarizing events "in the days that followed," which dissipates the immediacy of the on-page climax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean and effective plot structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural to Causal) lens. Orientation is swift, the causal chain of the ritual is logical within the world's rules, and the closure—a Decisive Change with a felt cost inside the vortex—lands squarely on the page. The final image of the thawing atrium provides resonant confirmation of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a clear closure of Earned Stasis. However, the resolution lacks a tangible, on-page cost; the storm conveniently veers away, validating Elias's choice without him having to pay any price for the significant risk he took. This convenience softens the impact of the closure, making the successful outcome feel less earned and more fortunate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a felt emotional cost and a legible "after" state for the protagonist. Orientation is established cleanly, and the single-scene structure is well-maintained, resulting in a cohesive narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building emotional pressure through imagery and memory rather than causal turns. The structure is simple but effective, leading to a clear closure on the page. The final beat provides a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias finds peace, with the felt cost being his transformation from a haunted recluse to a purposeful guardian, which is a strong and legible resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mystery piece by piece. The closure provides a clear Decisive Change for Elara's role and knowledge. However, the resolution lacks a legible cost; her "borrowed time" being "extended" reads as a pure reward, undermining the stakes. The causal link between seeing the visions and immediately understanding the garage sale flyers is also a convenient leap that weakens the plot's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the plot builds through a deepening of atmosphere and stakes rather than conventional causal turns. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the scarred drake offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's premise, with the return to solitude providing a clear, felt cost. The cadence shift at the climax ("as a kite string snaps") is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens, where a sequence of methodical actions builds to a resonant final state. The structure is sound: inciting incident, decision, execution, and resolution. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias finds peace in his completed legacy, with his impending death serving as the legible cost. The plot progression is logical and serves the story's meditative goal, though it lacks any turns or reversals that would create higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure through atmosphere and mystery rather than strict causality. The structure is a clean, single scene that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure, where the meaning of "homecoming" is reweighed at the cost of Elara's prior skepticism. The slightly convenient arrival of the archivist with the exact proof needed is a minor weakness, but it functions as the final piece of accumulated evidence in this textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sequence of ritual actions toward a clear closure. The structure is simple but effective for its length, and the final image of the reawakening garden provides a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the felt cost is conceptual and environmental rather than personal to the protagonist, which slightly lessens the impact of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the structure relies on a significant contrivance: Tracker's intuition guiding Elara to a specific crate scavenged weeks prior. This convenience weakens the "because/therefore" linkage, making the central discovery feel unearned. While the closure is a valid Charged Poise that reconfigures the stakes with felt cost (the uncertainty of "tinted revelations"), the crucial step to reach it is built on luck rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and interiority to an on-page closure. The final moment is a perfect example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring Elara’s options and internal state with a felt cost—accepting her isolating gift as a strength. The structure is simple, elegant, and perfectly suited to the story's length and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a logical sequence of events and good orientation. However, the closure unit is critically weak due to a lack of earned cost. The antagonist is neutralized by the magic of the chess pieces in a single sentence ("bursts of light that enveloped him in wonder's embrace"), which functions as a deus ex machina, deflating the climax and resolving the central conflict without any sacrifice or lasting consequence for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift, the symbolic conflict builds through patterned action, and the closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration ("he became what he sought"). The cost is made legible through the flashback, and the final image provides a definitive before/after state, fully satisfying the requirements for this lens at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive, with each beat logically compelling the next. The closure is exemplary: a Decisive Change (talent restored, new mission accepted) and a Conceptual Repricing (the meaning of "home" is redefined) land with a perfectly legible cost—the shattering of the mercury-glass orb symbolizes the destruction of her protective illusions and the embrace of painful reality. The structure is tight, purposeful, and delivers a powerful, earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural narrative. It establishes the setting, stakes, and character's goal, then moves to a single, focused confrontation that leads directly to a Decisive Change with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist and the world. The closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the painful act of confronting his own arrogance—and the story's internal, magical causality holds perfectly. The entire piece functions as one cohesive and effective structural unit.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly within a single, continuous scene. The structure builds pressure through poetic deepening rather than external events, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization lands with a clearly articulated and emotionally resonant cost—the surrender of innocence for wisdom—which feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands on the page with a clear before/after state. The cost—confronting painful memories—is legible, but the final resolution where the statue "quelled the acid sea's fury" feels slightly too complete, softening the lingering sense of a price paid for the newfound stability.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building pressure through atmosphere and journey rather than strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands clearly on the page with a felt cost, and the final image of the mirror confirms the internal change. The structure is sound and serves the narrative, though the coincidental discovery of the grotto slightly softens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure for a magical-causal climax. The structure is clear and the magical premise is established. However, the closure—Mira's physical return from a distant isle—is a massive coincidence that undermines the story's established stakes. The conflict was spiritual communion, but the resolution is a convenient survival story, breaking the narrative's internal logic and making the ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building density toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The causality, driven by the waxing moon, is elegant and consistently applied. The final image lands with a clearly articulated emotional cost ("the pain of remembering mingled with the comfort of reclamation"), making the navigator's new state of being feel entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The setup (virus, relic, motivation) logically progresses to the central action (the ritual) and culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The final image of her mended "graceful fracture" provides closure with a felt cost of vulnerability and acknowledged truth. The structure is sound for its length, with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length and chosen lens. Operating under an Accumulative/Textural drive, it moves from a concrete inciting incident to a series of deepening revelations. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing a clear "after" state for the protagonist with a well-defined emotional cost, satisfying the rubric's highest demands for a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot follows a tight, flawless causal chain under a Causal lens, with each discovery directly enabling the next. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the promise's meaning is reconfigured, lands with a clear and emotionally resonant felt cost—the acceptance of his chosen life. The structure is simple but perfectly executed for the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure. The inciting incident (defying the council's warning) leads directly to the journey, climax, and resolution. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (DC) where new knowledge ("the final warning was no prophecy, but a deception") reconfigures Elara's motivation and sets a new course. The cost is the confirmation of betrayal and the acceptance of a dangerous political battle, which lands with clarity and charges the ending. The Causal lens holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a Decisive Change. However, the closure is significantly weakened by a lack of legible cost. Elara's alchemical journey through the portal is frictionless and unopposed, making her return "altered by the journey" feel unearned. Without a tangible price paid for the transformation, the resolution lacks the weight it strives for.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clear Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is elegant: a contained physical space (cabin) frames a vast internal one (dreamscape), leading to a potent closure. The ending is a well-earned Conceptual Repricing, where the grave is re-contextualized not as an end, but as another event to be chronicled, landing with the felt cost of accepting a chronicler's detached role. The causality is psychological and entirely coherent within this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, effective Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s calm is deepened, is earned through the emotional exchange. The felt cost is the vulnerability required to connect with Mira, which recharges her purpose. The narrative progresses smoothly from a simple repair to a profound emotional discovery without any causal missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from pressure to problem to solution with satisfying logic. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where scars become glowing runes—is visually and thematically powerful, landing on the page with a clear sense of transformation and felt cost. The structure is perfectly suited to the story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual until the climax. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); Elara's apology is delivered, but the resulting partial forgiveness leaves her "mended but forever scarred," a legible and earned cost. The structure is tight, coherent, and perfectly suited to the story's length and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The story sets up its elements and pays them off. However, the closure lacks a tangible, felt cost for the protagonist himself; the "cosmos exhaled in relief" is a grand but emotionally distant consequence. This abstraction slightly undermines the weight of the final change, making it feel more like a cosmic reset button than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elias's understanding of his life's work is reconfigured, lands with a legible conceptual cost and a clear before/after state ("Elias was changed"). The single, continuous scene is perfectly suited to the story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens, where an external event directly causes an internal shift. The structure is tight: the intrusion provides a perfect, tangible problem that forces Elara to confront her internal stasis. The closure, a Decisive Change in her perspective, lands cleanly with the felt cost of releasing her long-held grief, reconfigured into new possibility. Causality is solid, if a little too perfectly symmetrical.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is clean and effective, using a two-shard sequence to build toward a strong closure. The plot, driven by interpretation, aligns perfectly with the story's themes. The ending delivers a valid Conceptual Repricing with a clear, felt cost—the loss of a rigid worldview—making the before/after state perfectly legible under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, establishing a ritual and then breaking it for the climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elias re-evaluates his own isolation, lands with a clear felt cost—the loss of his safe detachment. The plot's primary weakness is the convenient mechanism of the musician calling back "somehow redialing the booth directly," which softens the causal integrity of the story's most pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the steps of a ritual. Orientation is established immediately and effectively. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into an Earned Stasis, lands cleanly on the page with a clear felt cost ("tears of haunted bliss," "forever guardian"). The structure is sound, but the repeated authorial-feeling phrase "proximate cause" acts as an unnecessary signpost for the causal chain, slightly weakening the otherwise organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens that builds to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at closure. Causality is impeccable: the reciprocal act of sharing stories directly causes the fracture of loneliness. The cost of vulnerability is made perfectly legible in the final beats, anchoring the entire narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and logical Causal lens, where each discovery propels Elara to the next. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, culminating in a Decisive Change that is earned on the page. The closure, where peace is absorbed, directly answers the inciting motivation with a legible, albeit emotional, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story executes a clear Decisive Change, but its central flaw lies in the absence of a legible cost. The resolution acts as a soft reset, retroactively erasing the inciting problem without a meaningful sacrifice or lingering consequence. While the Causal lens is consistently applied ("she wrote, therefore reality changed"), the unearned nature of the fix critically undermines the plot's integrity, making the closure feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal state until a final shift. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for this length, moving from stasis to a clear inciting action (Thorne's offer) to a climax (creating music). The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elias's relationship to his filmless camera and his own silence is transformed, landing with the felt cost of “joyful sorrow.”

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot is built on a clear and compelling causal chain, with each discovery logically propelling the character to the next. The story adheres perfectly to its Causal lens, leading to a potent Conceptual Repricing at the end that re-contextualizes the protagonist's identity with a tangible emotional cost. The structure is flawless for this story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory and emotional density toward its climax. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring Elara’s sorrow into a "hopeful lament" at the cost of profound, lingering uncertainty. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition, with a clear before/after shift in Elara's state.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive lens, with a clear setup, inciting incident, and a Decisive Change at the climax. The closure, where Elias has proven his point and Marcus's walk signals defeat, lands with a legible (if not deeply felt) cost. The structure is well-paced for the length, and orientation is established immediately. It is a very well-constructed, classic narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Structure is a tight, single scene that builds atmospheric pressure toward a clear closure unit: Elara’s whispered confession is a Decisive Change. The "before" (trapped in silence) and "after" (committed to amends) is legible, and the cost—accepting responsibility—is felt in her emotional release. Orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere to an effective climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the town's mindset shifts, is earned and legible on the page. The cost is visualized in the dimming orb, providing a clean, satisfying structural arc for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through Elara’s internal state and key symbolic objects. The structure, using a brief flashback to charge the present scene, is highly effective. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with a poignant, visible cost: Elara’s transformation is paid for by the loss of her human life and relationship, a price made tangible in Marek's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and culminating in a resonant final image. The structure is a single, perfectly paced scene. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where the line "the moral weight of his ambiguity lingering" re-frames Elias's "solution" not as a victory, but as an endless, costly performance. The cost is palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, linear causal structure where the protagonist's action directly produces a Decisive Change. The closure is legible, functioning as a Conceptual Repricing of the location's sacredness. However, the resolution lacks a felt cost; the "dissolving of boundaries" is framed as a purely positive "release," which diminishes the dramatic weight of the climax and makes the fulfillment feel too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain that holds from the inciting incident to the closure. The final beat is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, where Elias renounces his goal, landing with a clear, felt cost and re-contextualizing his entire journey. The structure is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is elegant, progressing through a clear setup, escalation, and climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands with a tangible cost—the cracked lens—which is a significant strength. The central causality (philosophical questions generating physical propulsion) is highly conceptual and asserted rather than mechanically grounded, but it holds consistently within the story's lyrical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clear and effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a sequence of resonant images and symbolic actions, culminating in a strong closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias's mission is validated and his internal state re-centered, with the cost of his continued solitude made tangible in his return to solitary creation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens, culminating in an effective Resonant Reconfiguration. The plot is tightly causal from the moment the measuring tape is introduced, and the final image provides a resonant closure with a clear, felt cost for Marcus. The structure is flawless for this length, but it is capped out of the 9+ band by a prose artifact issue in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The narrative builds pressure not through a causal chain but through an intensification of sensory and emotional density, culminating in a powerful climax. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing of "innocence" and a Resonant Reconfiguration for the character, landing with a clear, felt cost ("innocence could never return... for her own soul") that is both earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through observation and reflection rather than traditional causal events. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow is transformed, the library's harmony is restored (Earned Stasis), and Elara is left with a palpable, on-page emotional cost. This before/after state change is legible, earned, and thematically resonant, fulfilling the highest requirements for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure is simple but highly effective, building emotional weight through a sequence of symbolic actions rather than a causal chain. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elias achieves an Earned Stasis; the shift from "fragile" to "resilient" convictions is legible and the cost—his lost naivete—is felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, using an Accumulative/Textural drive that builds to a powerful climax. The story delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing for its closure, as Elara's understanding of "closure" is fundamentally reweighted. The cost is made explicit and felt on the page ("tears streamed down her face, old griefs resurfacing with raw intensity"), making the final change earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully. The structure builds density through layers of imagery and psychic discovery, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization—that unused love is archived and can be repurposed for new beginnings—provides a clear "before and after" with a palpable emotional cost, successfully landing the closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through the repeated action of tracing stars. The structure is clean and effective for its length. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into a state of Earned Stasis, is achieved on the page with a clear before/after state, and the felt cost is the emotional and spiritual labor of the long vigil, which feels appropriately scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene. Causality is established through the logic of "charming" probabilistic echoes, leading to a powerful on-page closure. The final image provides a resonant Charged Poise and Conceptual Repricing, with the cost of "endless vigils" making the transformation feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building insight through a sequence of resonant experiences. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elias's internal state, is earned and legible. The use of "translocation" as a transition mechanism is consistent with the world's rules but functions as a convenient plot device that bypasses the friction and causality of travel, softening the structural integrity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a clean and earned Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the final image of Elara on the boat crystallizing the journey's stakes. The symbolic causality is coherent and the cost—letting go of her past fears—is made tangible in the ticket-punching scene.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story uses a Hybrid (Accumulative/Situational) lens, culminating in a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias commits to a new stance. However, the inciting discovery relies on an extreme coincidence—that the new guest lost this specific bolt on that specific night in his village—which strains credibility. While coincidence can complicate, here it functions as a near-deus ex machina, neatly resolving the central mystery and slightly cheapening the earned nature of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent structural integrity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot advances through the steady, patient accumulation of the rune's power, culminating in an on-page Conceptual Repricing where the pretender is unmasked. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—Vesper's dissolution and Elowen's acceptance of her eternal, cyclical vigil—making the narrative arc both complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively builds to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with emotional cost. The plot's primary weakness is its reliance on the neat convenience of the father's pre-packaged Morse code confession, which feels less like an organic discovery and more like solving a tidy puzzle box.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid structure with a Causal closure. Orientation is handled well, and the single scene is focused. However, the closure, while a Decisive Change, relies on a convenient mechanism; the ancient stone circle's ability to activate modern communication nodes is a significant logical leap that isn't foreshadowed, weakening the causal chain and feeling like a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates on a clean and effective Causal lens; each beat follows logically from the last. The structure is sound, moving from discovery to deciphering to a climactic action. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the embryo is unsealed), but the cost is somewhat muted—the "challenge" to the elders is framed as an immediate, unalloyed good, softening the price of her insurgency.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. It establishes the setting, character, and stakes, then uses a single trigger (the rumble) to force an internal crisis. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias integrates his past and present symbols, landing with a clear, felt cost and a shift in stance. The causality is entirely internal and psychologically convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) lens. The plot escalates from atmospheric pressure to a direct, causal climax where the protagonist's actions create a Decisive Change. The closure lands with a clear "before/after" state for both the character and the world, and the final line establishes a legible, felt cost ("the luminescent ache lingered"), making the resolution earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens from the inciting incident (sabotage) to the climactic choice. The closure is an effective Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist achieves his stated goal, with the cost being the existential risk he undertook. The structure is tight and purposeful for the story's length, with a clear before/after state of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot structure is logical, but the resolution to Elara's central tactical problem hinges on a major coincidence. The sudden activation of "dormant networks" via a "hidden mechanism" functions as a deus ex machina, conveniently providing the means to act right when she needs it. While the final choice and its consequences (a Charged Poise) land on the page, the causal chain leading to that choice is significantly weakened by this unearned plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. The orientation is clear, and the plot progresses from finding the scrap to the final resonant action. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara solidifies her purpose with a legible, if subtle, cost—the reinforced renunciation of her father's world. The causal logic, under its chosen lens, is sound and well-paced for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of traditional causal links, the plot builds through an intensification of atmosphere and the breaking of patterns, which serves as its own form of escalation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where communion is chosen over possession—is earned, emotionally resonant, and carries a clear conceptual cost, fulfilling the story's lyrical ambitions with structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a tight, logical Causal structure from inciting incident to a decisive choice. The closure is an exemplary use of Charged Poise, crystallizing Elara's new stance and the stakes of her impending confrontation with the journalist. The plot is perfectly scaled for the story's length, with a clear and compelling before/after transformation in the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain under a Hybrid lens, resolving with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page. The primary weakness is the abrupt, un-bridged transition from hearing a past cry to being physically present in the memory ("suddenly, Elara was there"). This leap in causality feels convenient, weakening the otherwise solid structure by relying on a magical jump rather than a developed mechanism of the "time folding" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building atmospheric pressure toward a decisive turn. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into a state of "tentative peace," is achieved on the page with a clear, felt cost of shared vulnerability. The final image of the lingering hush is potent and earned by the preceding accumulation of tension and its release.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal chain leading to a Decisive Change at closure. Orientation is handled well, and the plot progresses logically. The climactic retrocognitive flash revealing the fire's origin feels slightly convenient as a late-stage motivator, but it successfully fuels the final, on-page action of renaming the automaton.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara. The structure is sound and orientation is immediate. However, the closure is slightly weakened by a final sentence that summarizes the transformation, rather than letting the final image of her with the coin carry the full weight of the change on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens from inciting incident to resolution, with each step logically following the last. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the relationship's dynamic with the felt cost of Alex's comfortable skepticism. The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, providing a complete and satisfying arc without extraneous moves.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and discovery rather than strict causality. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands effectively as Elara's purpose is crystallized by the floating fossil, establishing a clear 'after' state with the felt potential of the vast task ahead serving as the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Causal Hybrid lens, building pressure through a methodical task that causes a final shift. The closure is a Decisive Change (reversing the hourglass) that is well-prepared and causally sound within the story's logic. However, the resolution lacks a legible cost; the cliffs' groan of "release" and the "dawn of open paths" frames the outcome as purely positive, undercutting the weight of the averted doom by not showing a trade-off or lingering price.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts at the climax. The setup, meeting, and execution of the plan are logically sequenced. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the plan is enacted and the microfilm is transferred), establishing a new state of affairs with the felt cost of continued risk and separation. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with excellent structural integrity. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the promise, lands cleanly on the page, with the cost—the renunciation of his lineage's greed and vengeance—made legible in the final image of his "unweighted" heart. The plot mechanism, while internal, is consistent and leads directly to this resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens, culminating in a well-executed Conceptual Repricing. The magical causality of the lantern glasses serves as a clean inciting incident for the climax. The closure, where Elias grasps a new understanding of resilience, lands with a clear conceptual cost—the reconfiguration of his worldview—which is made legible in his readiness to "shape new clay in its light."

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from inciting incident (petal dropping) to a ritualistic climax and resonant closure. The closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis, where Elara’s actions reinforce her purpose, reconfiguring the initial wistfulness into quiet resolve. The cost—her own vulnerability and ceaseless effort—is felt in the final image, making the ending earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric and emotional pressure toward a single point of change. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s understanding of her solitude is transformed, lands with a clear, felt cost—the pain of reliving her memories. The before/after state is legible and earned within this non-causal framework.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere that culminates in a clear Decisive Change with felt cost. The structure is sound and orientation is never in doubt. However, the resolution hinges on the arrival of Mira, a coincidence that functions less to complicate the situation and more to resolve it directly, which slightly undermines the sense that the protagonist earned the resolution through his own sustained struggle in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story demonstrates masterful causal plotting within its tight scope. Every beat logically follows from the last, from problem identification to solution and consequence. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration in the form of Charged Poise, is perfectly executed, landing with the palpable costs of continued vigilance and the community's slow healing, making the victory feel earned and precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmospheric pressure that culminates in a clear climax. The closure, a Decisive Change in the protagonist's internal state, lands with a stated emotional cost ("wistful sorrow"). However, the causality of the climax feels somewhat convenient; the church organ appears without setup, functioning as a magical trigger rather than an earned consequence of the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a Causal lens, but a major causality break occurs at the climax. The leap from finding a ribbon to identifying a specific victim from a 1987 ball ("With a sudden resolve, he lanced the core of the mystery") is entirely undramatized and functions as a deus ex machina. This convenience leap dissolves the narrative tension and makes the resolution feel unearned, even though the final closure image (a Resonant Reconfiguration) is present.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, moving from discovery to decision with logical steps. The closure, a Charged Poise, is valid and lands with a felt cost as Elara steps into the storm. The structure is weakened by the high degree of coincidence required for the plot to function—the specific shipwrecked journal containing the exact coded solution washing into *her* station's nets just as she needs it feels overly convenient and lessens the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a strange atmosphere that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing of Elias’s past. However, the central causal link—the scaffold wraps projecting a map onto the glass flake—is a significant logical leap that feels more like a convenient contrivance than an earned discovery. This deus ex machina weakens the structural integrity, even for a non-causal design, making the closure feel less impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure effectively compresses a long timeline (the startup arc) into backstory to frame a potent present-moment scene. The drive is a Hybrid of Causal setup and Accumulative/Textural closure. The final beat provides a strong Conceptual Repricing, as Elias reinterprets his entire journey, landing the ending with a clear, if quiet, sense of change and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a proper Decisive Change for closure, fitting the scope. However, the central mechanism—traversing realms via a lucid dream to instantly connect with and heal Thorne—is a convenient fantasy device that lowers the stakes. The resolution feels too easy and lacks a tangible, on-page cost, making the 'after' state feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive lens. The plot progresses through a clean because/therefore sequence, from the inciting incident to the resolution. The closure, a Decisive Change (curse lifted) and Resonant Reconfiguration (her internal state), lands on the page with a clearly legible, albeit subtle, cost ("hidden pains," "victory's quiet toll").

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain, with each beat logically leading to the next. The closure is a decisive, on-page change—from root-bound to free—with a clearly articulated and felt cost ("risking her very essence"). This structure is perfectly scaled for the story's length, delivering a complete and resonant arc without any breaks in causality.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive for its scope. Orientation is immediate, the because/therefore progression is clean, and the closure is a Decisive Change with a visible, on-page cost ("inherit a shadow of his torment"). The structure is lean and purposeful, perfectly utilizing the single-scene format to achieve a complete narrative arc with no wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The discovery of the object directly causes the internal crisis and the subsequent Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—the forfeiture of an emotionally-armored life for a more vulnerable, meaningful one—making the plot architecture exceptionally sound for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a state of grief and intellectual longing that culminates in a ritual act. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of his connection to Mira, is legible and provides a clear before/after. The cost is the renunciation of his old ambition for a tangible link in favor of an abstract understanding. The plot is sound, but the resolution via a perfectly effective magic seed feels convenient, softening the earnedness of the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural lens. It establishes a ritualistic cycle and executes it with a clear beginning (gathering), middle (fusion), and end (preservation), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure, "Wonder endures," lands with the felt cost of eternal repetition, perfectly re-charging the story's premise. Orientation is immediate and the logic of this timeless world is held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure is on the page with a felt emotional cost. However, the plot mechanics are weakened by the awkward authorial intrusion, "No, that wasn't right; the action was to crown the pearl itself," which breaks the narrative flow at a pivotal moment and exposes the scaffolding of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive is executed well, building a coherent emotional pressure that culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The cost is legible in the shift from seeking erasure to navigating guilt. The structure is simple but effective, with the convenient discovery of the graffiti being the only element that feels slightly less than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot structure is taut and logically sound for its length, operating under a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens. Causality is strong, with the watch's function directly enabling the resolution. The story achieves an effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at its conclusion, where Elara possesses a new asset (the documented words) but faces an imminent, re-contextualized future with the second letter's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood effectively. However, the closure is critically flawed by a lack of cost. After establishing a binary choice where Elara must "sacrifice her dream," the plot introduces a magical loophole that gives her everything, which reads as a deus ex machina. This convenience dissolves the stakes and makes the Decisive Change feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the plot progresses through a deepening of atmosphere and intensity rather than causal turns. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands with a palpable cost in Elara's concluding thoughts, making her recommitment to her task resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story demonstrates a clean, effective causal structure under the Causal lens. The arrival of Lir provides the inciting incident, which leads to a clear sequence of actions and realizations, culminating in an on-page Conceptual Repricing for the closure. The plot is concise and well-paced for its length, with every step logically following the last.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story demonstrates excellent causal logic under the Causal lens. The progression from campfire to lighthouse to climax is seamless, with each beat motivating the next. The closure is strong, featuring a Decisive Change for Mara and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elias, both landing on the page with a clear, felt cost—the piercing of Elias's emotional armor.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene causal structure under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The setup, development, and payoff are logical and well-paced. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Lir's understanding, is earned on the page and directly results from Elara's actions, carrying the felt cost of his lost naivete. The plot is effective and structurally sound for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure toward a decisive internal shift. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise: a resonant reconfiguration of knowledge and strategy that lands with a palpable sense of hope. The cost—centuries of patient vigil—is clearly established, making the final moment of clarity feel entirely earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal structure is sound, and the story achieves a clear Decisive Change on the page. However, the closure is weakened by an absence of legible cost; the "impossibilities" unleashed are purely positive, meaning the protagonist achieves his goal without a meaningful sacrifice or trade-off, which diminishes the dramatic weight of his triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal desire toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands cleanly on the page, with the cost being a permanent alteration of the protagonist's perception. The plot relies on the timely discovery of the map and key, but this fits the fable-like logic. The structure is simple but effective and flawlessly executed for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story employs a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens with impressive control. The plot, structured as a ritual, builds pressure through a series of deepening actions rather than simple cause-and-effect. The closure is an excellent Conceptual Repricing, where Elara’s doubt is reframed as fuel, landing with a resonant and tangible cost on the page in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a single, continuous ritual that builds emotional density toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The final image of the "constellation on the atlas page" lands with a clear, felt cost, transforming the reaper's grief into a tangible, navigable legacy. All structural components are exceptionally well-handled for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens with solid orientation and a decisive, on-page change at the end. However, the closure lacks a legible cost. The resolution is a clean success where the protagonist's only price is effort, and he emerges emotionally fortified. This absence of a trade-off or lasting price diminishes the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through a sequence of resonant images toward a clear closure. The Decisive Change—reframing the act of expunging from burying memory to ending isolation—is earned on the page and leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the community. The felt cost, confronting his father's traumatic death, is made legible and directly motivates the final action, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a clear and effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere until a causal turn resolves the plot. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's internal state and a Decisive Change in the crystal, is executed on-page with a legible, albeit subtle, emotional cost (her single tear). The narrative logic, from problem to intuitive solution to magical result, is internally consistent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The inciting incident (radio report) leads directly to the complication (flawed plan), which necessitates the solution, resulting in a clear Decisive Change (the successful evacuation). Closure lands with a resonant image of hope, and the initial orientation is swift and effective. The felt cost is a bit light—the burden is reframed rather than deepened—but the structure is otherwise flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from the inciting incident (clone's challenge) to the resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change—the merging of selves—with a legible cost in the loss of prior identity and "lost illusions." The structure is tight and logical for the length, with each beat leading directly to the next, satisfying the requirements for a publishable piece.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through reflection until it culminates in a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the seed is re-contextualized as a creative solution. The structure is sound, with a clear inciting incident and on-page closure that establishes a new path forward for the protagonist. The cost is the lingering uncertainty of the seed's origin and the risk of the new venture.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses through the intensification of a single, repeated action, which is perfectly suited to the length and concept. Closure lands as a clear and poignant moment of Earned Stasis ("his true haunting a quiet vigil"), with the cost of his eternal, lonely service made legible in the final lines. The structure is elegant and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into Earned Stasis, is achieved on the page with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of exile. The final image of the guardian rising with renewed vigor, having integrated its desolation, provides a legible and satisfying before/after state. The piece correctly understands that at this length, a single, powerful deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is exceptionally strong, with each failed attempt logically compelling the next, leading to an earned Decisive Change with a clear cost. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident through to the closure. A minor out-of-voice idiom at the climax is the only hairline flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot coheres around a single, intensifying internal action, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (renewal) that lands with the felt cost of reframed grief. The causality is internal but rigorous, and the final change is earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal structure, but the causality is weak due to convenience. Elias finds the exact magical tools (hourglass, radio) and immediately understands their function from "old sailors' tales." The Decisive Change at closure is clear, but it fails the cost proof test; the "gift" of alternate memories for passengers and Elias's untroubled smile at the end register as a reward, not a price, which significantly undermines the resolution's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly, building pressure through the intensification of the weaving. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing that leads to Earned Stasis, lands with a clear and tangible cost on the page ("the sinew thread spent"). Causality is flawless within its own established logic of "rational enchantment."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR). All causal links are internal and psychological, leading to a closure that reweights the character's entire reality with a legible emotional cost ("achievement mingled with grief"). The orientation is immediate and clear, and the single-scene scope is perfectly managed. The ending is not a simple success but a complex reconfiguration of knowledge and loss, which is exceptionally handled for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's causal structure is flawless and serves as its strongest pillar. The progression from the initial signal to the final delivery of the message is logical, tight, and well-paced within the two-shard structure. The closure, a Decisive Change for the old woman and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara, is rendered on the page with a clear, felt cost (her own quest is set aside), fully satisfying the requirements under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with a strong because/therefore structure from discovery to resolution. The closure is a decisive, on-page change with a clear emotional cost. The plot progression through the phase-transition rooms is highly logical but feels slightly schematic, like moving through levels, which keeps it from perfection. Orientation and pacing are otherwise excellent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with a clear setup, execution, and closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) is legible and carries a felt emotional cost. The primary weakness is the lack of friction in the central plot device; the ink-shard ritual works perfectly on the first attempt, making the resolution feel more like a procedural success than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure is an elegant and linear progression toward a single, transformative ritual. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, transforming the dying language into an immortal chorus, and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the canyon itself. The cost is felt in the finality of the spoken form's death and the storyteller's spent energy, fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional piece.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere that culminates in a Decisive Change. The closure occurs on the page with the metamorphosis, and the cost (loss of humanity) is legible. The causal mechanism—a magic phone call—feels slightly convenient, and Mira’s appearance as a concluding narrator is a minor deus ex machina that softens the ending's ambiguity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens with a decisive, on-page closure and legible cost. Orientation is excellent. The plot is slightly weakened by the convenient introduction of the solution— "signaling through heart rhythms," a method from "stolen scrolls"—which feels more like a retroactive patch to solve the problem than a discovery earned through in-scene struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is handled well, and the plot progresses logically from setup to a clear climax. The closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis; the successful delivery provides a moment of resolution, while the arrival of the next client confirms the ongoing nature of the struggle and its cost, landing the ending with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, where mood and discovery build pressure rather than strict causality. The structure is clean, moving from a mundane quest to a symbolic climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias’s silence is “forever altered,” lands on the page with the felt cost of his former identity. However, the mechanism for this change—the halo fragment—functions as a convenient magical key, slightly weakening the story's internal logic at its most pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds from premise to experiment to a satisfying Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a subtle but legible cost—her cherished "observed solitude" is now "laced with connection," altering her state. This is a strong, well-contained narrative arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a state of longing to a decisive action. The closure is a strong Decisive Change in Elara's internal state, achieved on-page with a clear emotional cost ("Tears blurred her view"). The causal chain from discovery to resolution is clear, and the story lands its ending effectively within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, following a clean causal chain under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Elias achieves his goal but the reward is repriced from physical reunion to spiritual fulfillment. The cost—giving up his tangible link to Mira and his specific hope—is made legible in the moment he steps toward the portal and finds her essence instead of her form.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story uses a clean two-shard structure (past mistake, present resolution) and holds to a causal drive lens effectively, especially at the climax. The resolution, where Elara uses folklore and observation to solve the puzzle, is a direct and earned result of her actions. The closure provides a clear Decisive Change, but the felt cost is softened by the reveal that the memories were merely "held in escrow," which reframes decades of loss as a necessary waiting period, slightly lessening the dramatic weight of her recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a clear single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure mechanism is flimsy. The link between Kael's internal realization and the external reversal of his exile is asserted, not earned. The cost—confronting his past via "whispered vows"—is summarized in a single clause, robbing the climax of its weight and making the Decisive Change feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is coherent and orientation is clear. The primary flaw is the closure, which lacks a legible, on-page cost for the protagonist; the aversion of a global problem without a personal price paid in the climax makes the resolution feel unearned and diminishes its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is flawless for this length, operating under a dominant Accumulative/Textural lens that builds atmospheric pressure toward a Causal climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the spirits find peace and Elara's guilt is absolved, lands with a clear and potent conceptual cost—the on-page confession of her family's hidden shame. The before/after state is legible and earned, making this a structurally powerful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through layered observations—map, vault, frescoes, two silent films—leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page as Elias understands the henge's true purpose, with the vault's "exhale" providing a tangible sense of a threshold being crossed, a cost of vulnerability paid for a new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens. Orientation is swift and effective, and the progression from discovery to revelation is logical and well-paced. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "letting go," lands with undeniable force, and the cost—foreclosing his analytical obsession—is clear. The plot is nearly flawless for this length, with the only slight weakness being the high convenience of the globe containing the perfect message.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain breaks at the climax. While the setup is clear, Lira's arrival and instantaneous ability to decode the message and operate the mechanism function as a coincidental resolution, which violates the rubric's "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule. This significantly undermines the earnedness of the Decisive Change (Elowen's freedom), making the closure feel convenient rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is its greatest strength, using the elevator's ascent as a clear, propulsive framework for discovery. The Accumulative/Textural drive is executed flawlessly, with each floor adding a new layer of knowledge that deepens the central stake. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where Elias chooses to become a "keeper" rather than seek release, is a resonant reconfiguration that lands with a clear conceptual cost. The plot is efficient and fully contained.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story employs a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through a sequence of observations that culminates in a decisive revelation. The closure, a form of Conceptual Repricing where the void is proven to "remember," is executed on the page with a clear and felt emotional cost. The structure is simple but effective for its length, with the shift in focus from the clouds to the empty space providing a potent tightening before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory detail and internal reflection towards a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure. The causality is flawless: the discovery of the coin leads to the attempt, which forces the confrontation with limits, leading to the final earned stasis. The cost—accepting the finite nature of her art—is legible and reconfigures the story's initial premise beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure where each discovery logically builds on the last, fitting its short form perfectly. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, re-weighting the sky as a navigable space, combined with a Charged Poise for the protagonist. The felt cost—his re-framed but persistent isolation—is legible in the final beat, creating a satisfying, resonant conclusion without needing a dramatic physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere toward a Decisive Change (the 'uncap' action). The closure lands with a felt emotional cost. However, the inciting incident—finding the exact prophecies and magical gears needed—relies on convenience rather than earned causality, slightly weakening the structural integrity of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain (message leads to discovery, which leads to action, which leads to resolution), and the closure is a decisive, on-page change. However, the structure feels more like a summary of events than a dramatized scene, progressing through time with phrases like "The next dawn brought another." The primary weakness is the lack of a felt cost; the characters overcome their "isolated ways," but this is presented as a pure gain, not a trade-off, which diminishes the weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is masterful. It establishes the stakes and atmosphere, builds density through key objects, and culminates in a clear closure unit on the page—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The cost, the poignant knowledge that the end is only soothed, not averted, is felt in the final images. Causality is textural and coherent, with the puppet's flaws directly enabling the climax in a satisfying, patterned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's Causal structure is flawless, moving from inciting incident to resolution with clean, motivated steps. The closure, a form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands with undeniable, felt cost on the page in the final two paragraphs, fulfilling the highest standards for this length. The external problem is solved, but the protagonist's core situation is re-consecrated, providing a powerful, lingering aftereffect that is earned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean two-shard structure under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The causal chain from insight to action to resolution is clear and motivated. Closure is a Decisive Change (reconciliation) that lands on the page with the felt cost of past separation and present vulnerability, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully, building pressure through poetic association rather than strict causality. The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene that moves from setup to a climactic choice. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elara sacrifices her identity as a vendor to become a story's origin, a cost that is clearly articulated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens: the dream incites, the pools guide, the pavilion enables the climax. The structure is sound and orientation is immediate. The primary weakness lies in the closure's cost legibility; while a Decisive Change occurs, the on-page price paid feels muted and is processed with an almost frictionless efficiency, slightly undermining how earned the final "sanded smooth" state feels.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, causal structure (problem -> decision -> action -> resolution) and the closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community is united, is legible on the page. The drive is a Hybrid of Causal and Accumulative. However, the resolution feels unearned; the farmers' skepticism "melting" happens too quickly, and the final state of unity is asserted in a summary rather than demonstrated through a climactic scene. This lack of a costly, earned final beat weakens the plot's overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is sound for its Accumulative/Textural lens, building intensity within a single scene. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of Elias's identity. However, the cost is not strongly felt on the page; the change is declared ("he emerged...no longer just an engineer") rather than demonstrated in a way that makes the price of his mental labor visceral. The ending feels more like a successful summary than a resonant, costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with setup (doodle, gravity, seeds) paying off logically. The structure is a clean, single-scene arc with a Decisive Change for closure as Elara secures the orb. The cost—surviving immediate, lethal danger—is present on the page, making the resolution feel earned within the scope. The plot is well-executed and tightly contained.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a state of longing to a climactic act of creation. Orientation is handled well, and the plot is coherent. The primary weakness is in the closure; while it achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration by changing the state of the grove, it lacks a legible, on-page cost. The resolution is cathartic but feels unearned because no significant price—emotional, physical, or otherwise—is paid to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses through a deepening of insight rather than external events, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with a legible, felt cost—the acceptance of melancholy—making the final shift in stance powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through the layering of recovered silences. The structure is sound, with clear orientation and a well-executed closure. The final realization ("the quiet of forgiveness") serves as an effective Conceptual Repricing that reweights the initial motivation with a clear, felt emotional cost, landing the ending with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection rather than strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is legible and earned; the community re-evaluates chaos as a component of serenity. The cost is the endurance of the grotesque bloom to access its wisdom, which lands well. The structure is simple but well-suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with a well-defined structure for its length. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, but it lacks a strongly felt or visible cost on the page. Lira's triumph feels complete and unburdened, which slightly diminishes the impact of the risks she faced, making the resolution feel more like a task completed than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next step in the investigation. The structure is tight for its length, moving from setup to complication (the patch) to resolution. The ending provides a strong Conceptual Repricing, re-framing the investigation's findings as a tool for future prevention, with the silent city serving as the palpable cost of past failure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory detail toward a clear climax and resolution. The closure is a valid form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as the "sculpted hush" is restored in an enriched state. However, the plot's trigger—the metaphorical sculptor's chisel—feels arbitrary, and the closure lacks a clearly legible or deeply felt cost, which keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Pressure builds through atmosphere, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Elara's understanding of her role is reconfigured. The cost of this change—confronting painful truths about her failure—is legible and felt on the page, making the closure powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The structure is an elegant experiment-result-reassessment loop that leads directly to the closure. The final beat delivers a powerful Conceptual Repricing, as Elias's initial goal is inverted into a new, more complex understanding. The cost—the failure of his original quest—is palpable and earned, making the "triumph and turmoil" feel entirely credible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing where Thorne's personal memory becomes shared myth. The closure lands with a legible conceptual cost for Elara. The structure is clean and effective for the word count, with orientation established immediately. A minor deduction is for the final paragraphs, which function as an epilogue, slightly diffusing the impact of the primary scene's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a tight, single scene that builds pressure through atmospheric and symbolic density. Closure is achieved through a powerful Conceptual Repricing for Marcus, landing on the page with the felt cost of his shattered worldview, perfectly captured in the moment he touches the glass and feels his own pain mirrored back.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot builds not through causal turns but through the gathering of resonant elements—puzzle pieces, amber bead—that enable the final act. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of sacrifice, lands with an explicit and moving on-page cost ("her form dissolving"), making the before/after state starkly legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear, linear structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a valid Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The causality of the magic is internally consistent, and the cost (the silk, his fears) is established. However, the plot feels somewhat frictionless; the journey into the depths and the ritual itself unfold without a single complication or setback, which lessens the impact of the successful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear three-act structure in miniature, and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible. The primary flaw is in its causality; Elara finds the exact universes and information she needs with frictionless convenience, which undermines the stakes and makes the plot feel more like a summary than a dramatized struggle. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds at the end, but the causal chain leading there is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is elegant and effective under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot moves from a state of quiet duty to acute crisis (lamp out) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghosts are pacified. The closure lands with a clear "before/after" state change and a felt emotional cost for Elias, solidifying his purpose. The causality is driven by atmospheric pressure rather than intricate plot mechanics, which works perfectly for the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The structure is coherent, and the closure lands with a subtle, felt cost ("elation shadowed only by the depth of the night"). However, the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening of pressure; the ritual proceeds masterfully and without incident, which lessens the impact of the final, world-altering claim.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and symbolic weight toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands effectively, recontextualizing Elias's identity and future, with the felt cost being the assumption of the donor's legacy. The structure is elegant and well-suited to the length, with the tea mistress's intervention serving as a logical pivot point toward the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is excellent for its Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot moves from a state of quiet obsession to active discovery, with the clink of the pin serving as a perfect inciting incident. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds peace, and a Conceptual Repricing of the labyrinth's meaning. The felt cost is the "laborious" process and the confrontation with his own grief, which is legible in the final paragraph, making the ending earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean, effective ritual arc under a Causal lens. Orientation is swift, the single scene structure is well-maintained, and the closure provides a clear Decisive Change (dying realm to rekindled realm). The chain of events is logical within the story's magical framework, leading to a satisfying resolution. The cost is slightly understated ("hands trembling"), but the transformative payoff is legible and final.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) for its closure. Elias's final state is a re-weighting of his reclusion, earned through the on-page choice to renounce confrontation and act with anonymous compassion. The cost—forgoing direct reconciliation—is legible, and the structure is clean and well-suited to the story's length and internal focus. The causality holds without fault.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and memory toward the climax. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elias's act of tending the mosaic redefines his relationship with his past failures. The cost—confronting the guilt he'd been too "heuristically gentle" to face before—is felt, making the final state of peace earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is simple but well-structured: a clear setup, a series of intensifying actions, and a resonant closure. The final image provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (RR), where the vows are preserved at the cost of the living illusions, landing the change on the page with a felt cost. The structure is clean and serves the concept perfectly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, causal structure. Orientation is immediate and effective, and the progression through "false starts" builds logical pressure toward the climax. The closure is a Decisive Change that occurs on-page with a clear outcome and a felt cost, fulfilling the story's central promise. The causal chain from Elara's final gambit to Thorne's failure is direct and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building sensory details toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a legible cost—the "farewell to doubt"—which successfully re-frames the narrative. However, the final beat where Elara develops her own weather feels slightly too neat, softening the price of her transformation and bordering on an unearned reward.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens until the climax, where the resolution strains credulity. The improvised pulley system—rigged from spelunking wires, cave vines, and crystal shards—feels like a deus ex machina, an overly elaborate and implausible solution not sufficiently foreshadowed by the character’s established skills. This convenience weakens the otherwise solid cause-and-effect structure leading to the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is a clean, resonant causal chain from discovery to climax. The closure, a conceptual repricing of "lost words," lands with a clear emotional cost on the page. The use of the lie-detecting leaf to verify the map is an excellent beat that reinforces world rules while advancing the plot through a motivated choice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is simple but elegant: setup, inciting incident, creation, and a climactic activation. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for "wonder"), landing on the page with a clearly felt cost—Elara’s immense, silent labor—making the final harmony feel truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is exceptionally strong for this length, moving from external trigger (magnetic shift) to internal crisis to decisive action and resolution (Decisive Change). The closure lands with a clear cost—a damaged but salvageable farm—and a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's internal state. The plot adheres perfectly to a Causal lens, making every beat feel necessary and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear and effectively executed, with each step logically leading to the next. The closure achieves a Decisive Change on the page. However, the resolution lacks a tangible cost; the healing is frictionless and universally positive, which softens the impact and makes the final emotional state feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a clear, logical progression under a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) lens, culminating in a Decisive Change. However, the closure is weakened by the late, unearned introduction of "digital consciousnesses." This addition diffuses the focus from Elara's personal liberation and lacks prior setup, reading as a convenient grace note rather than an integral part of the narrative's cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Hybrid (Causal-dominant) structure. The progression from setup to a knowledge-deepening turn is logical within the world's rules, and the final beat is a well-executed Charged Poise (RR) that reconfigures the protagonist's mission. The ending provides a clear "before/after" shift in knowledge and intent, landing with a felt potential cost of confronting the past, making it a strong piece of short-form plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal turns but through a deepening ritual density, which is a perfect fit for the premise. Closure is achieved with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as the prophecy is silenced and Elias's internal state is reconfigured into peace, with the cost being the loss of his driving purpose. All structural components are sound and serve the intended effect.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure—a summary of the developing relationship followed by a focused climactic scene—is effective for this length. The causal chain in the final act is tight: Elias's interrogation (cause) leads to Mira's confession (effect), which enables the test with the seal (cause), resulting in the building's whisper (effect). The closure is a strong Decisive Change, with the "agreed upon lies" giving way to a shared, tangible truth, and the cost is the loss of that comfortable fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure toward a single, decisive action. The closure unit is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s internal state is decisively altered, with the felt cost of shedding her old identity legible on the page. The causality of the ritual leading to the resolution is clean, and the final image provides a resonant conceptual repricing of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with a well-defined goal, obstacle, and resolution. The closure unit is a powerful combination of a Decisive Change (retrieving the scroll) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiving Silas), which lands with a clear, felt cost on the page ("the weight lift from her soul"), making the ending both conclusive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain, making excellent use of its single-scene structure. The plot advances logically from seeking, to confrontation, to revelation, culminating in a Decisive Change with a felt cost. The closure is legible and earned on the page, satisfying the requirements for publishable work under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. It builds layers of lore, atmosphere, and evidence, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of knowledge and intent. The closure, a Charged Poise where Elara's final, difficult path is crystallized, lands with a clear felt cost and perfectly suits the story's ethereal mode, satisfying the 9+ test for on-page closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and clear. The progression—from observation to ritual to insight to resolution—builds atmospheric and thematic density toward a quiet but decisive closure. The final vow constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration of the character's purpose, with the future effort of teaching serving as a legible, albeit conceptual, cost. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the contemplative subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot is a model of economy and causal precision, progressing from mystery to investigation to revelation without a wasted beat. The inferred Causal lens is held perfectly. The story culminates in a flawless "Charged Poise" closure, where the final image reconfigures the stakes and leaves the protagonist with a palpable, world-changing burden, demonstrating mastery of structure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building Elias's prophetic stature through layered revelations rather than a traditional causal chain. The structure is coherent, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—lands effectively, crystallizing his new role. The cost is felt in his final, unshakeable isolation and the physical decay of the observatory, which provides a satisfyingly concrete anchor to his abstract transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood toward a single action and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the character's emotional state. However, the closure lacks a legible cost. The resolution is frictionless, a simple success that sweetens bitterness without any sacrifice or trade-off, which significantly lessens its impact and makes the earned change feel slight.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure that is well-suited for its length. The orientation is established immediately, and the plot progresses logically from inciting incident to resolution. The closure provides a Decisive Change (the threat is neutralized) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias confronts his own past), with a felt cost on the page. The resolution is slightly convenient, but the overall architecture is sound and holds the Causal lens without fault.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and thematic weight toward a clear climax. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands effectively as the signals are sent, initiating change with a felt cost of commitment and risk. The celestial/magnetic mechanics are a bit magical, but they function consistently within the story's logic without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear and effective single-scene structure under a Hybrid lens that successfully shifts to Causal for the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena's state shifts from controlled to free, lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost described in the final line. However, the mechanism of the resolution—an "incantation" that acts as a "psychological anchor"— feels slightly convenient and less rigorously established than the problem it solves.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a clear one-scene structure, but its causal chain is critically flawed at the climax. The resolution hinges on a coincidence—the light breaking through the clouds—which functions as a deus ex machina to trigger the mutual epiphany. This external event resolves the central conflict instead of the characters' choices under pressure, making the closure feel unearned and the cost unfelt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building conceptual density towards a powerful final beat. The structure is a single, coherent scene that flows logically from problem to insight to execution. Closure is achieved through an excellent Conceptual Repricing: the ringing of the bell redefines the world and the protagonist's role, with the "awakening dormant leviathans" providing a clear and resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal structure is immaculate, with each discovery logically leading to the next beat in a tight, propulsive sequence. The story establishes its stakes and setting quickly and efficiently. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elara gains knowledge at the cost of proof, lands with a potent sense of bittersweet irony and visible cost, perfectly executing its Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot moves from a state of passive waiting to active preparation, culminating in a well-executed Charged Poise closure. The final image—Elara descending armed with her new tool, ready to act regardless of the Council's verdict—makes the reconfiguration of her stance and the cost of her new agency perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. Orientation is swift and evocative. Instead of a causal chain, the structure builds pressure through atmospheric density and intensifying events (capsized boat, gale), culminating in a resonant Conceptual Repricing of "endings." The closure is on the page, with a clear felt cost, fully satisfying the requirements for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, fitting its scope. Orientation is established immediately, and the single scene builds density effectively. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the meaning of the burned letter and their "mismatch" is reconfigured with a felt cost—the poignancy of their fleeting, one-night connection.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear, Causal lens with a legible Decisive Change at its closure. However, the resolution lacks a demonstrable cost; Elar's "quiet triumph" feels unearned because he sacrifices nothing tangible or emotional on the page. The plot progresses smoothly but without the friction that makes a resolution impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through the gradual assembly of the collage and the climbing vines. The structure is clear and serves the concept well. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the completed mural symbolizes the community's "mended hearts," an earned state of healing with the felt cost of confronting past pain now visible as a public artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The plot, a single continuous scene of discovery, is perfectly scaled. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise: Elias's stance is crystallized, the cost of forgoing proclamation for quiet work is felt, and the final image of the re-placed crystal resonates with suspended potential. Causality is entirely internal and impeccably tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a purposeful ritualistic journey, not a series of causal turns, which builds pressure effectively toward the climax. The closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis: Elias finds the nexus and achieves his goal, but accepts its impermanence, a resonant reconfiguration with a clear felt cost ("he knew the longing would return").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean, and the orientation is immediate. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is legible but relies on a soft, metaphysical causality; restructuring a clock to restructure perception is a powerful metaphor but a weak plot engine. The resolution of the external threat ("The observatory held") is unearned, deflating the physical stakes that were built so carefully throughout the story.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the climactic resolution hinges on a weak causal link. The daughter's appearance, "summoned by Elara's subtle command," reads as a convenient, un-established power that solves the central problem without sufficient groundwork. This deus ex machina undermines the earned quality of the closure, making the otherwise sound structure feel engineered for a tidy emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plot follows a strong, clean causal chain under the Causal lens: inserting the key enables the tracing of runes, which leads to awakenings, which provide the crucial knowledge. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, reconfiguring the stakes from a cosmic mystery to an immediate, personal quest with a clearly articulated cost ("confronting her own shadow"). The structure is sound and delivers its final turn with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from inciting incident to a climactic resolution. The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's internal state—is on the page, but it lacks a legible cost. She receives a comforting vision and emotional healing without any sacrifice or trade-off, which weakens the plot's overall impact by making the resolution feel too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through recurring memories and the slow transformation of the sea glass, leading to a potent closure. The final act—releasing the pearl's glow—is a Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing an Earned Stasis where Elara finds purpose in her earthly bonds. The cost is the acceptance of her fallen state, re-contextualized as wisdom, making the ending feel earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal state toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, offering the pendant, lands with a felt cost (sharing a private burden). The primary weakness is the man's arrival; his explanation, "I followed the patterns," is a significant coincidence that conveniently resolves Elara's question ("But to whom?"), weakening the causal integrity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative structure that effectively builds pressure toward a Causal, Decisive Change at the end. The closure unit is strong: the protagonist's final action (crushing the shell) has a clear and legible cost, resolving the primary stake. The three-part collection structure is slightly formulaic, but the overall progression, escalation, and resolution are executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a clear Decisive Change (the arbor is healed). However, the closure feels unearned due to a near-total lack of friction or cost. The causality is functional—he sings, the vine glows, the blight recedes—but it unfolds so smoothly that the resolution lacks the weight of a hard-won victory. The cost is abstract ("weight of ancestral eyes") rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with impeccable precision for its length. The structure builds atmospheric and narrative pressure toward a single, decisive climax. The closure—a Decisive Change creating the map—is clean, earned, and lands with a palpable emotional cost on the page ("Tears froze on Elara's cheeks"), making the final reconfiguration of her hope entirely legible.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the plot progresses through a steady gathering of knowledge. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands perfectly on the page: Elias emerges with a completed tool and a preserved resource, a clear "after" state earned through the "before" state of brokenness and study. The cost is the focused labor across a season, fitting the quiet stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Decisive Change, with a clear before/after state and a legible cost. Using a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, the plot builds texture through repetition before resolving via a strong because/therefore chain at the climax. The core constraint of being "boundary-lessly trapped" shapes every tactic, making the final earned freedom highly satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Structure is tight, framed by the boiling kettle, creating a perfect container for the emotional progression. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara’s stance toward her grief is reshaped into a manageable form. The cost is felt in her deliberate engagement with the painful memories embodied by the wood, making the final peace deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a deepening of psychological pressure, not causal events, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The cost—fully integrating her regret—is legible and earned by the story's internal logic, perfectly fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    The plot follows a clear and logical causal chain under the Causal lens, moving from survey to discovery to a decisive action. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, changing the terminal's state from ruin to potential. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; Elara's success comes with little demonstrated cost or complication, which slightly undermines the weight of her achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is established immediately, and the structure builds density effectively toward the closure. The ending is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias endures the pain of his past to achieve peace, with the cost of that regret felt on the page. The causality is internal but coherent and satisfying for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a reflective mood that culminates in a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where Elias re-prices his quest from finding truth to deconstructing lies, lands with a clear, felt conceptual cost. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the length, moving from quiet seeking to a pivotal discovery and a transformative realization without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is elegant and linear, building atmospheric pressure toward a quiet climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias trades his fulgurite for knowledge and an enchanted seed, provides a clear "before and after" with a tangible, on-page cost. Every element serves this final, charged image of renewed purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection rather than external events. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where Elias’s understanding of "absence" is reweighted, landing with the felt cost of his majestic but lonely solitude. The final image of the resilient rose against the frost provides a perfect, resonant cadence that fulfills the story's promise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly within the single-scene scope. The structure builds density toward a clear climax, and the closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing—the definition of beauty is irrevocably altered. The cost, the loss of organic purity, is rendered with palpable weight in the final lines, making the ending both earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building a ritual that leads to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is clean and the orientation solid. However, the closure, while resonant, feels somewhat convenient; the magical "singing" of the sapling provides an external validation that lessens the weight of the internal shift, and the on-page cost of the ritual is minimal, relying heavily on recounted backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens: the signal from the geese leads to the search, the breadcrumbs lead to the box, and the logical analysis leads to the release. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (fountains revived) with an accompanying Conceptual Repricing (magic is understood science). The cost is subtle but present in the softening of her rigid skepticism, representing an earned change. The structure is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds density and thematic weight toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds thematic and atmospheric density towards a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image reconfigures Elias's purpose and understanding with a felt conceptual cost—the abandonment of his old, simpler craft—making the closure powerful and earned. Causality is entirely coherent within this textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is sound and the orientation is clear. The primary weakness lies in the closure's cost legibility; the magical transfer of inscriptions feels more like a release of burdens than a choice with a new, visible price, and the final sentence's claim of village-wide improvement is an unearned causal leap.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building from discovery to resolution effectively. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the echoes find peace and Elias is enriched, lands with a clear, felt emotional cost ("his heart aching softly").

The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, making the single suspended moment powerful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through layered action toward a resonant final image. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dust awakens, is earned and lands with conceptual weight, though it is capped by prose issues elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building thematic density towards a powerful closure. The final moment, where Elias fades after scattering the ashes, is a perfect Conceptual Repricing of his life's work, landing with the ultimate cost—his own existence. The structure is tight, with the chair's stopping serving as a perfect, self-contained inciting incident that makes the ending feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The structure is tight, with a descent, discovery, and ascent that provides a satisfying narrative shape. Closure is excellent, with the final lines re-framing the character's entire purpose and establishing a new, more difficult beginning with a clear felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure through repeated sessions rather than a linear causal chain. The Mosaic structure, telescoping time from one evening to weeks and months, is handled clearly and effectively teaches its pattern. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara and a Decisive Change for the town, lands on the page with a visible cost in the elder's tears and the long passage of time, making the final harmony feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the celestial alignment toward a clear climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the greenhouse and Elias's memories are transformed, is on-page and carries a felt cost (reprocessing the loss of his family). The structure is simple, elegant, and effective for the story's length, with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens from problem to resolution, and the closure (a Decisive Change) is on the page. The primary weakness is the lack of a tangible cost; the solution arrives without sacrifice or setback, and the final "enduring awe" feels more like an asserted gain than an earned reconfiguration born from struggle. The mechanics of the plot are sound, but the stakes lack a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot is well-structured, moving from observation to a specific, catalytic event (finding the shard) and culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The unlocked door feels convenient, though the story attempts to justify it as a "creeping normality." The closure lands with a legible conceptual cost—the mystery is solved, trading wonder for understanding—making for a solid, if slightly neat, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with each beat leading logically to the next. The closure is a Decisive Change, and the cost (shattering a rigid worldview) is felt. However, the central causal link—why threading this specific ampoule into a coral arch triggers these precise, thematically-tailored telepathic visions—relies on unexplained magic, feeling more convenient for the theme than structurally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot structure is exceptional for its length, holding a clear Causal lens. The central action—constructing a mathematical proof—leads directly to the Decisive Change of the staircase unwinding. The closure lands with a potent conceptual cost, as the earned freedom is immediately questioned, making the "before/after" legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building thematic weight toward a clean and effective closure. The final beat is a perfect example of Charged Poise: the scroll is complete, his purpose is reaffirmed, and the next action is imminent, all with the felt cost of his exhaustion and lonely hope. The structure is simple, elegant, and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition, meeting the 9+ quick test with a clear, cost-bearing final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens, and the closure lands effectively with a Decisive Change (spring thawed) and a resonant Charged Poise ending. The primary weakness is the resolution's mechanism; the idea that a few baking ovens could generate enough channeled heat via "rigged pipes" to thaw a city's "central spring" strains credulity. This convenience softens the earnedness of the climax, introducing a moment of symbolic logic where physical causality was previously implied.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The inciting incident (finding the yoyo) leads directly to the climax. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, landing on a resonant final image and a clear conceptual cost ("the hunger stone's warning etched forever in his reversed reality"), making the before/after state powerfully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates on a flawless Causal drive lens, where each action by the protagonist directly and logically leads to the next beat of the confrontation. The structure is clean, the stakes are established early, and the progression toward the climax is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and effective. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, is earned and lands with conceptual cost as Elias crystallizes his mission. The petal dropping provides a poetic but clear inciting incident, resulting in a well-formed narrative arc for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, executing a single, continuous scene with powerful effect. The Accumulative/Textural lens builds a dense atmosphere that is paid off by a sharp, causal turn with the discovery of the locket. The closure unit—a Conceptual Repricing of his quest combined with a Decisive Change in knowledge—lands with palpable emotional cost, transforming his abstract mission into a profoundly personal one.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's causal structure is its greatest strength. The inciting incident (blackout) logically forces a change in tactics, leading directly to a climactic discovery and a clear Decisive Change in knowledge. The closure lands effectively with a conceptual cost—the heroic family narrative is lost and repriced—making for a solid, self-contained arc under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and effective, following a Hybrid (Causal -> Accumulative) lens. The plot progresses logically from plan to execution, culminating in a resonant Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) for closure. The final image, with the shadow remaining, establishes a clear and poignant cost, making the "fragile peace" feel earned rather than simplistic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's structure is taut and purposeful, unfolding within a single, well-defined window of opportunity. The drive is Accumulative/Textural, as the density of Amir's grief and the weight of "unused potential" build to a powerful final image. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of his loss into a new purpose, lands with significant felt cost, and the causal chain from system cooldown to final vow is flawless and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a Decisive Change for closure. The plot mechanics are logical and all setups are paid off. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; the process of finding the pieces lacks significant setbacks or complications, which slightly lessens the earnedness of the final success. The cost of the journey is not strongly felt on the page, leaning more towards a smooth procedural victory.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end, which is a valid structure. The closure lands with a felt cost—accepting the burden of truth. However, the plot hinges on an improbable coincidence: finding a piece of the specific pocket watch he destroyed. This deus ex machina significantly weakens the causality and the earnedness of his final insight, making the resolution feel convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, following a clean, causal chain from setup to resolution. Orientation is established immediately, and the single-scene focus maintains pressure effectively. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves an internal shift toward absolution, lands with a clear felt cost—the immense emotional and mental weight of his past error. The plot is simple, but its execution is precise and confident, holding the Causal lens steady from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is a single, potent emotional arc that culminates in a decisive change of action—rejecting the sea for the land. The closure, with Elias walking toward town, lands with a clear, felt cost (the past he cannot reclaim) and powerfully reconfigures his identity as a navigator, meeting the 9+ gate requirement with ease.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly structured with a clean, causal chain of events where each choice logically propels Alex forward. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of his journey's purpose, lands with a clear and earned on-page cost—the first "pang of regret." The causal lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear causal structure under a Hybrid lens, culminating in a Decisive Change. The plot mechanics are functional, but the inciting incident—finding a magical fortune cookie that perfectly addresses her specific existential crisis—feels overly convenient and lessens the sense of earned discovery. While the closure lands with a cost (her human form), the immediate, purely positive framing of the outcome mutes the weight of this sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a single, coherent ritualistic scene that builds atmospheric and emotional pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax. The closure, where Elara accepts her past and commits to the future, lands with a legible felt cost—the widening crack in the saucer and her purifying tears—making the before/after state change undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a repetitive, intensifying sequence of actions. The structure is clear, orientation is swift, and the causality holds. Closure is achieved with a Decisive Change (opening the portal) that feels earned by the preceding accumulation, and the final image of the abandoned ship provides a resonant, conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear linear structure, but its causality is critically weak. The resolution relies on a cascade of unearned coincidences: the bugs happening to reveal a lever, the detour happening to avoid a fissure, and the bugs happening to activate volcano-calming runes. While the story attempts to reframe this as "orchestrated coincidences," it functions as a series of convenient plot devices that resolve the central conflicts without earned agency, violating the "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each action logically following from the last. The plot is well-structured for its length, establishing the situation, introducing a complication (the other sentinel), and resolving into a clear Charged Poise ending where the revolution is imminently triggered. The closure lands with a palpable sense of forward momentum and risk, making the structure very successful.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in an effective Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure lands cleanly, reinterpreting the mother's promise. However, the felt cost required for a top-tier score is diminished because the sacrifice of "elusiveness" is immediately presented as a benefit, undercutting the dramatic weight of the trade-off she makes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's purpose is crystallized. The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost, shifting him from a passive to an active vigil. The primary weakness is the inciting incident: the discovery of the sealed envelope feels too coincidental ("as if placed by an invisible hand"), weakening the causal chain that leads to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain within a single continuous scene, culminating in a clear Decisive Change (Elias acquires the maps). The plot mechanics are sound, and the orientation is established effectively. The score is held back by a lack of visible, on-page cost at closure; the final lines frame the outcome as a pure "triumph," which undermines the stakes paid and weakens the narrative's lasting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent structural control under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The single scene is well-anchored, and the reflective block on Jax is purposeful, directly charging the present action. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elias’s purpose is crystallized and the setting is re-contextualized as a site of future rebellion. The cost is felt in the weight of Jax's legacy, fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional piece at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is immaculate, following a clear "because/therefore" logic that makes the fantastical plot feel inevitable. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a tangible change (the mended clock) and a clear, albeit temporary, cost. The story masterfully uses its objects and setting mechanics to build a tight, satisfying arc that adheres perfectly to the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless causal structure within its scope. The plot progresses logically from setup to a resonant climax and concludes with a well-defined Charged Poise closure, where the stakes are reconfigured with a felt cost (the acceptance of uncertainty). The approaching monsoon serves as an effective and persistent constraint that shapes the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Working under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is effective. It builds mood and imagery toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with a felt cost. The primary weakness is the inciting magical object—the antique lace—appearing with perfect timing and convenience, functioning as a benevolent deus ex machina that lessens the sense that the protagonist forged his own path to healing.

The Causal lens holds—each beat follows “because/therefore” from envelope to promise—though the grandfather reveal arrives via summary rather than scene, slightly blunting the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor crystallizes Lirah’s acceptance and the community’s reconfigured web. Causality holds—each tag fragment found tightens the weave and narrows Lirah’s isolation—until the final image reweights the premise with communal embrace. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph; no drift. The cost is legible in the luminescent ache that transforms into shared strength.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight: quest → canal journey → cage → key forged from borrowed time → release → cadence resolved. Closure lands on-page with the bird’s new song re-weaving the nap, a clear Decisive Change. The “felt cost” is slightly abstract—the stolen moments—but the ending image makes the trade-off legible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vision of Mira stepping through mist reframes loss from absolute to conditional. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each drip, chip, and memory layer tightens the emotional field until the mosaic “solves itself.” The cost is the relinquishing of certainty, visible in Elias’s quiet pocketing of the eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s self-imposed invisibility is re-cached, now knowingly, after he has transferred hope. The tape fragment’s rediscovery triggers the decisive change; the cost is the renewed exile he accepts. Causality is tight—every beat flows from the outage loosening the grate to the woman’s recognition. Lens is causal and held to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s hybrid state crystallizes the stake and carries felt cost (loss of full humanity). Causal lens holds—storm → leaf → transformation—without gaps. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the brooch’s return re-weights Elias’s artistic purpose from solitary excavation to communal witness; causality holds—rain trails he chooses to follow lead directly to the buried nexus and to Mira; the cost is legible in the relinquished heirloom and the insomnia that “loosens slightly” but never vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s loss of rigid foresight is paid for by her new fluid awareness, and the cave’s spirit now speaks through her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sound, light, and shadow intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the line “her clairvoyance flickering.”

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each staggered interval layers density until the final image reweights exile’s void into communal chorus. Closure is a Charged Poise—the valve passed hand-to-hand crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation anchored by 120 words. One causal leap: vision-to-speech transition elided but pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is earned: the confession-punch physically summons the phantom train, after which the family-curse reversal crystallized as ‘truths fortified against denial’. Cost manifests in the irrevocable boarding and the shattering of lifelong habit. Causal links from cracked arrows → map → ticket → train remain clean, but the transition between the ticket punch and the fortress itself relies on spectral shorthand rather than grounded consequence, curbing the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile’s final pulse reweights Elara’s stance from doubt to wonder, and the cost—memories now distinct yet forever beyond physical reach—is legible in the last image of her lighter descent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases until the unheard symphony resolves into peaceful resonance. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fragment shatters, pulling her back, leaving her “to ponder the hushed echoes”—a Charged Poise that reweights immortality’s cost. Causal lens holds: storm → mutiny → breach → fragment’s backlash. Orientation is anchored early (“prismatic escondite… deep within the Earth’s forgotten veins”). One minor causality wobble: the exact mechanism by which the fragment both enables and resists the breach could be crisper.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from discovery of ink → decoding algorithm → midnight breach → asylum granted. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: Alex liquefies their own rigid honesty to seal the forgery, then closes the casket—Earned Stasis with visible forfeiture. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. One tightening suffices and is cleanly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn’s layering of hum, light, and invented history tightens the stake until the explorer’s journal texture reframes the town’s silence as deliberate hush. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias closing the notepad under refracted blooms—whose conceptual cost (he now shoulders the mountain’s secret) is legible but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer until the poison label re-weights the archive. Closure is a Charged Poise atop the red container—options reconfigured, cost felt in the talismanic clutch of the label. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (nightfall) is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Inferred lens is Accumulatively-Lyric; the pattern is taught and closure lands as Charged Poise, yet the composite chronology (star charts, the logbook, cello) feels somewhat forced into the accordion triple→single beat squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural night gathers disparate castes, foreclosing passive reliance on outsiders and reweaving Raftoria’s social fabric. Causality holds throughout; every earlier graffiti command reaps an on-page consequence (communal markets, protective collectives). Cost — potential loss of the carnival forever — is conceptual but sharp, and the foundation stone embedded in the wall is the keystone image that finalises the change.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each timed chemical beat layers density until the grain’s dissolution reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the photograph crystallizes loss while the sun irreversibly breaks the hush. Cost is legible in the final image: “the grain’s vanishing glow against the emerging sunrise.” Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene arc holds: arrival → diagnosis → patch → flight. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias returns to his shop, path foreclosed yet charged with cost felt in Mira’s gratitude and the drone’s departure. Causal lens holds; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias steps onto the lake, options narrowed, cost legible (“If I freeze…”). Causal chain—falcon → coordinates → condensation oracle → departure—holds. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Minor slack: the condensation oracle’s rules are asserted rather than dramatized, blurring causality one notch.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Thorne slips away as the town revives, leaving a resonant after-image of balance restored. However, the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural, and the final cost is diffuse—felt by the town, not visibly paid by Thorne. The causality between footsteps and revival is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Story holds Accumulative/Textural lens: because he climbs, reads scuffs, speaks into lattice, the density accrues until the final copper night yields Charged Poise—his ghosts fade into that calm while the rising tide locks the bodies’ discovery. Causality remains legible and closure lands on page with undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s stillness and Elias’s “mournful elation” crystallize the cost of love repaid. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; each cameo tightens the orchard’s awakening and saps Elias’s vitality, but the ghost’s vanishings rely on poetic ellipsis rather than because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s new bridges and gardens reweight the premise from isolation to pilgrimage. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each overlapping path adds density until the final dawn image crystallizes the cost: Elara wakes “with threads in her hands,” evidence of labor she cannot recall.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each unearthed layer (sundial base, gnomon, scrolls) increases density and reweights the stake of lost faith. Closure—faith blooming like trees amid bones—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (three days of labor and doubt). Orientation is clear by 120 words. One minor ellipsis: how the gnomon traveled to the fungi patch is unexplained, but the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers chalk patterns, pseudonyms, and memories until the final “quiet rebellion” reweights the premise with felt cost (time running out before mailing).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the embroidered chart is hidden, the coup’s architects exposed, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—the candle’s pulse and stitched galaxies accumulate until the final silence reweights the stakes. One causal wobble: the vizier-poison tale arrives as pure exposition rather than dramatized memory, blurring the because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara steps out “ready to decide anew,” the cost being the reopened wound of regret now sealed by moonlight. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of unsent letters and spirit song intensifies until the final stance crystallizes. Orientation is clear by line 3; no drift. One transition (into boathouse) is clean. Causality holds: shard’s healing demands truth, which compels the evocation, which yields the apology moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene, one transition (the drift into anesthetic blur) remains spatially and temporally clear under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ending reweights meaning via “wounds grow roots, then flowers” rendered concrete by the coral transfer—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of light-painted memory thickens the orchard’s atmosphere and reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s smile on waking crystallizes the cost of sharing joy. One transition (daydream → waking) is clean and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the gourd’s warp reconfigures the surveillance regime’s power, a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible sparks and chaos. Causal chain holds—seed → greenhouse bioengineering → tactical deployment—though the raid’s timing edges on coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lullabies layer into living tapestries, reweighting pain into beauty. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“pain fully photosynthesized”—with centuries of vigilance as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Heart ignites, names resound, but the cost—renewed awareness of inevitable extinction—lands in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is the symphonic revelation—Thorne’s on-stage witnessing that unravels prior misreadings—framed as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the cost of separation still visible at dawn. Causal linkage is accumulative/textural: each promise added to the ink-well rises in density until the chords reweight the emotional currency; no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of chain → deciphering resin → integrating chain into floodgate calibration. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the gate’s tremble embodies the new, precarious balance. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3. One clean transition from artifact to mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure reaches a legitimate Charged Poise: the return of Aria with a reply crystallizes Elias’s narrowed options—he is now “balancing on the edge of hope and despair.” The meteorite, the mapping ritual, and the paper trails all converge in that single charged moment. A fractional deduction because the friend’s reply happens off-page; the moment remains felt yet partly secondhand.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias reweights his childhood loss from random tragedy to sacred necessity, visible in the final looped grain line. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each juxtaposition of wood grain and weather code thickens the pattern until the threshold insight crystallizes. Cost is legible in the phrase “ready to bridge those necessary distances with newfound reverence,” which concedes ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.2)
    Closure ritual occurs, yet the causality is opaque; the guardians appear because the feather is placed, not through earned alignment. Drive lens reads as situational (pressure crystallizes belonging) but the “shared exhale” mechanics arrive unexplained. Missing orientation penalty applies—who can exhale underwater unnoticed?

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: each seed/glass pairing thickens the pattern until the final map reweights “missing pieces” with conceptual cost; orientation is swift, the single deepening is legible, and the closure image (“luminous stories on the cave walls”) pays off the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern builds through sensory density and orchestrated coincidences until the final image reweights the premise. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elias’s quiet retreat with the bishop—leaving the cost implicit in his perpetual labor. Orientation is swift; the tidal arcade is anchored by line 3. No causality breaks, though the “gust from the sea” is a convenient coincidence that complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the final Charged Poise reweights exile from escape to canvas. Closure lands on-page—“her skin a testament”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.

    A single, continuous scene with a clear causal arc: stone-ripple → reading → prism glow re-weight. Orientation is anchored fast, closure lands on-page (earned noctilucent image), felt cost visible in Elias’s renewed craft.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the porcelain box’s ashes are redistributed, the emotional weight reweighted. Causal linkage holds—Eli’s decision to open the box to Mia is motivated by earlier encounter and memory. Cost is legible in the phrase “lighter now, its burden shared.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands on-page: the mandala’s serene upheaval re-routes multiple timelines with a felt price—Elara’s personal time-stream remains fractured.

Occasional summary compression (“revitalization rippling outward”) is brief and justified.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “the burden…lightened” because she reframes legacy from solitary weight to communal guide; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each echo-dense beat thickens toward this crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: mirrors bloom with possibilities while the painter dissolves, cost felt via “soon, he would return it.” Causal chain is thin—why this terrace, these mirrors?—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    An Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained—each beat thickens the nightflowers, clipboard, spirits—culminating in an Earned Stasis CR where the celestial tableau and life-force siphoning reconfigures the stakes without overt reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change: water released, drought ended, empire ruined. Causal chain—crack-map → valve → flood—holds under Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is explicit: “this release would ruin his profits, expose his schemes.”

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: each untangling act is a because/therefore beat that narrows outcomes and tightens price. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—liberated echoes surge outward, Elara remains but the realm alters—cost felt in the whirlwind of awakening. One coherent scene, no orientation debt. Lens holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the campfire stick becomes wand and constraint, the dome’s hush now charged with ethical cost.

One tightening beat suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the monarch’s perch reweights the arch from signal to collaborative monument, with felt cost—Elias’s relinquished control. Pattern taught early (ephemeral structures) and paid off in the final image. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's re-woven rope releases ancestral voices and melts her residual shame into charged poise; causal chain holds even under accumulative lens, cost in the auroral flood of remembered names is explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dream reweights the premise that paths choose the ready-to-decay.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portal seals, covenant accepted, Elias’s stance crystallized with felt cost (“covenant’s weight”). Causal lens holds: every beat—tracing schematic, whispering incantation, extending hand—links because/therefore to the final reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early by palace holograms and dusk sky; no drift. One minor ellipsis: how the moonlight vial was “captured” is elided, but it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thorne’s stance visibly softens, the pin reappears in Elara’s hand—cost is felt in the vanishing of his resentment. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one tightening suffices.

One meaningful cadence shift at the mirror-hum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused ribbon reweights “deciduous vows” from loss to cyclical renewal, felt cost in Elias’s grudging descent and Lila’s tear-bright understanding. Causal chain holds—gust dislodges bag → spill reveals notebook → shard fuses ribbon—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: how the shard embeds itself mid-fall is elided, but the image’s charge overrides the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias accepts curatorship of nonlinear knowledge with the orchard’s glow now shadowed by self-erasure risk. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirrored shard and whispered echo layers density until the final cracked mirror crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the renegotiated vow permits revelation for rescue, a conceptual repricing with felt cost (eternal secrecy loosened). Causal chain holds—diary gap → leverage → access. Orientation is swift; only one transition. Minor lens drift toward allegory weakens causal pressure in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: fog lifts, ship’s limbo ends, and twin-voice integration reweights Elara’s identity with felt cost—she leaves the only home her fractured self knew.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the quill still moving after silence, a resonant reconfiguration of her role from observer to “bridge.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of shadows, whispers, and ink accrues until the final image reweights the premise. One minor orientation wobble: “after the fog became solid” arrives late for a strict 120-word anchor, but the disorientation serves the closure image, so penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias’s lighter step in the starless hush reweights the stake—despair is not vanquished but reframed.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the threshold’s vanishing reweights the premise—Elara’s isolation is now breathable space, not punishment. Causal chain holds: Lorin’s encroachment via scars → Elara’s deliberate knock → shared memory surge → guided release → threshold collapse. Cost is legible in the final image: “the loaded emptiness now lighter.” One micro-turn suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the quantum promise collapses into literal diamonds, reweighting past trauma into communal wealth.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    For an Accumulative/Textural design, momentum thickens through sensual, alchemical detail until the program guides his hands in a charged poise—the greenhouse shudder and color burst land an undeniable before/after. All anchors are in place, and the gauntlet drop crystallizes the reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene accretive arc: inciting curiosity (dust trails) → revelation (button & Josiah) → personal echo → decisive digitization. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: archive room hums not as tomb but healing vessel; the lens stays textural-accumulative (dust patterns deepen meaning without causal plot turns). Causality tidy: dust guides archaeologist as it once guided earlier researcher.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the broadcast pierces indifference and Elara’s vanishing crystallizes risk. Causal chain holds—key → booth → lagoon mirror—though the puddle-map’s mechanics are lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Selects an Accumulative drive lens early and holds it: each silence widens like a woven veil. Orientation anchored within ~100 words; prism atrium and grotto geometry remain spatially coherent. Closure is crystalline—an Earned Stasis wrapped in negative space—paid when the prophecy literally “fades” and the cavern dims. One brief drift into exposition about “lonely paths” is forgiven because it feeds the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain holds: seed-sort → monument because folklore → moonstone prod → leaf divination → guardian emergence → renewed world-vow.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: anonymous call → arrival → ghost manifestation → ceiling discovery → winding reversal. Closure lands on-page with luminous dissipation and felt cost—Elias is left “in quiet solitude.” One minor causality wobble: the childhood ceiling accident is told, not dramatized, but it primes the final image without breaking linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is clean: frost pattern revelation → bottled whisper release → rupture compression. The closure unit is “the library tilted”—a CR that re-prices paradise itself at measurable conceptual cost: negotiated perfection is now permanently flawed. Minor time-compression dilation (“had arrived here eons ago—or was it yesterday?”) glides under lyric license. Closure holds; the cost is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes from failed rebel to elegist, cost paid in “burnished sorrow.” Causal chain holds—storm → mirror method → legible shard → reimagined narrative—without gaps.

    Lens locks to Accumulative/Textural under Hybrid mode: celestial alignment’s glow intensifies pattern until the pruning synaptic act reweights memory with earned resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the shared sanctuary is born, the regime’s erasure challenged—with the tangible cost of Elias’s own pain relived and repurposed.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → toll → riddle → ascent → revitalization. Closure lands on-page as city lights return, carrying the conceptual cost that wonder must be actively tended. Minor drift: the “drone failure” exposition is a compressed summary rather than a dramatized beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each displaced object layers density until the final cadence shift sanctifies the house. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s understanding reweights every prior “alive” house, and the cost is the irreversible knowledge that homes absorb souls. The shard’s journey from perfumer’s bench to ritual center is causally tracked. Orientation is anchored within the first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with undeniable cost as the garden re-animates around her. Causal chain holds: probe → statue → ampoule → structural crack → cascading visions → stance shift. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the staircase’s rupture reweights the premise and carries visible cost in Elias’s wondering if freedom is another illusion. Causal lens holds—each proof line tightens options until entropy halts infinity. Orientation is immediate; no drift. A hairline slip: the rupture’s mechanics feel slightly off-stage, nudging it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure arrives as a Charged Poise: the scroll is complete, the plan set, the cost deferred to the city’s strangers; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the causal chain from moonlight to awakening kindness is more lyrical than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rosewater, moss, oven heat) thickens until the thaw cracks the spring. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared initialed loaves rewire community bonds with visible cost: the beekeeper’s absence remains. No orientation drift; anchors fixed by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from yoyo discovery → reverse-engineering → hunger stone ignition → beam inversion. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the reversed beam spirals inward, time hesitates, and Elias steps beyond fate while acknowledging possible illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: fear’s unraveling reweights Elias’s stance toward life. Causal chain—“confess via paradox → fear starved → advisor gone”—holds under the Causal lens. Cost is visible in the cursed photo’s self-revelation and the extinguished clasp glow.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide harmonizes with the orchard’s song, a visible before/after shift. Causal chain—cloud reading → fractal sketches → dubbed music → tide tamed—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by line 3. Cost is conceptual (restless euphony resolved) but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scroll reweights the city’s entire mythos, and Elara’s whistle-call crystallizes her stance with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—spiral decoding → forbidden crack → revelation → irrevocable walk toward watchers. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One minor ellipsis (how scroll survived) is motivated by pattern-language mystique and does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: petal-fall triggers entry, discovery of letter triggers plan, plan triggers closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance crystallizes into “bridge between buried past and enlightened future”—with conceptual cost (truth still buried in chest).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias entombs the locket and his lineage’s dream, foreclosing retrieval once the mortar sets. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each inserted note layers absence until the final image reweights the submerged pavilion as archive. Cost is legible in the sealing gesture and the roaring sea’s echo.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the blackout lifts and Elara’s stance crystallizes into custodianship. Causal linkage holds—each micro-choice (setting aside the failed indexer, kneeling to stamp the ledger) flows from the premise. Cost is present but soft: “secrets no longer sunken” is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cranes ascend/descend, visibly carrying grief away while the shadow remains below. Causal chain—lantern → gem → cranes—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final image reweights the stake. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the glowing tears and the lingering shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Amir’s vow to “awaken what the world had buried” crystallizes a new stance with felt cost. Causal linkage holds—each perturbation tightens toward the homeland pool—yet the lens tilts slightly lyrical, not purely causal, which is acceptable under Hybrid. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the completed chip projects the frequency, reconfiguring Elara’s options (Charged Poise). Causal chain holds—each shard pulled tightens the next beat—though the pilgrim’s arrival feels slightly convenient rather than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the watch hand’s sudden reappearance forces Elias to measure the “true burden” of withheld truth, reweighting both past lies and present self-imposed quarantine. Motivated ellipsis around the destroyed watch is paid off when he holds its lone hand—visible, felt cost. The single continuous scene lensed as Accumulative/Lyrical holds; late reveal recharges motif rather than breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: misjudgment → lunar synchronization → flawless swap → earned stir of absolution. Orientation is immediate; stakes tighten when the moon reaches zenith and the ropes fall. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias pockets the pull, the cost of vigilance still palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: he turns inland, foreclosing the sea-path with felt cost (“quiet realignment”). Causal chain holds—compass misalignment → pole navigation → step-by-step reconciliation. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. Minor drift: “gravitating” used twice without tightening the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each newspaper clue triggers a therefore-move deeper underground, culminating in the conceptual repricing that the “time traveler” is his pre-wipe self. Closure lands with visible cost—the ball’s dissolution reconfigures meaning and forecloses return to blankness. Orientation is swift; transitions between shards (bench → tunnel → lake) are legible. Minor compression in the final paragraph keeps it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tightly woven causal chain—fortune-sparked choice leads to incense circle which triggers metamorphosis and reunion—earns closure on the page under a causal lens with no dead ends.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloth unfurls, the saucer absorbs her pain, and she descends with “saucer mended in spirit.” Causality is accumulative/textural—ink patterns, cloth resistance, and the click of the saucer build density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate; by 120 words we know who, where, and why. One micro-turn: the knot yields not by force but surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portal opens and Lira floats through, leaving the ship behind—cost is the abandonment of the recycled husk. Causal chain holds: each stitched photograph tightens the path to the final beat under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lightning-bug release crystallizes Elias’s shift from planned gift to communal salvation, with the beach runes confirming the cost of his emptied satchel. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of coincidences thickens until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal linkage parses cleanly: blackout creates opportunity, coded sundial drives allies to cradle, final twist of quill enacts closure; cost is legible in the furtive scratches guiding restored light.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and sustained; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“the universe’s friction had been an illusion, temporary grip eternally borrowed.” Cost is visible: Elara sacrifices continuous flight for understanding. Beat-to-beat linkage is pattern-based rather than causal, handled expertly within the chosen design.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene structure holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: storm intensity and poetic refinement tighten in parallel until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s poem sealed for covert transmission—whose cost (perpetual secrecy) is legible in the last two lines. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. One minor redundancy: “storm-kissed wonder” appears twice without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands clean: the needle card’s overture, once decoded, maps questions into literal roads, creating a decisive change that reframes Elias’s purpose; causality holds under a Situational pressure lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s shift from grave to “cathedral of potential” is legible and charged; the causal chain (Jax → tin → seeds → beacon) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the moon’s fracture sealing the vow as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored clock and steady compasses mark a before/after shift with felt cost—Elias must leave the filmic refuge and resume solitary vigil. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each compass flicker, splice timing, and piano bleed layers density until the monochrome rupture reweights fate. One minor drift: the splice mechanics are revealed late, so the orientation debt nudges the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sprout’s unnaturally measured growth and pollen-formed ancestral faces reweight the lens of doubt into a guiding force. The Accumulative/Textural lens is announced in the second paragraph and held across cadenced intensifications—pollen haze intensifies, library shelves swell, voices murmur—culminating in a single charged image ("doubt lingered luminously"). Cost is visible: her calibration kit can no longer fully trust what her senses affirm.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts the tides of remembrance without drowning, a reconfiguration charged by the compass-lace ritual. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final diffusion. One micro-turn (compass steadies toward horizon) suffices.


== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B 25-07 Think ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: her pruning with "acceptance" forecloses rage against entropy, with felt cost in "stripped the needless theatrics from her grief." Accumulative lens holds as dust patterns tighten pressure through chemical decay, no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands (charcoal legacy reweighted as hope), but cost remains abstract—"tears welled" lacks visceral price; Orientation Test passes canyon anchor, yet cost proof fails per Q2 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "sound returned, not as noise, but as music born from emotion's heat" reweights silence's premise through irrevocable change; Accumulative lens holds via thermal density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elias sinks into "unchased peace" with visible cost in his exhaustion, crystallizing the lens’ mending cracks. Causal lens holds tightly from package arrival through void occupation; pressure narrows options via spirit resistance. Minor flaw: dream revelation slightly convenient but anchored by prior fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with earned Earned Stasis closure: sanctions persist but anonymity ends with visible cost (community's shift to declared parcels), though "amplified quiet" repetition slightly undermines the final image's organic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation clear early (attic studio/stormy night), closure lands as Charged Poise with cost (emptied vial, fog lifting). Escalation lacks protagonist agency—"method came to her intuitively" undermines causal pressure at pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with visible cost (fragment's loss), but hyperbolic solution lacks escalation—disintegration feels convenient without prior setup. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost undercuts emotional weight via "smiled faintly" too soon after trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: chains remain but seeds are secured, with cost legible in "temporary burden" and the visceral image of green shoots piercing arid earth reconfiguring hope.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (hearing the sound brings release with visible cost in tears), but the transition from gathering absences to hammering lacks causal motivation—it's ritualistic rather than driven by escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation debt: "Emerald Station" anchor delayed past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff; closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost but lens ambiguity in escalation weakens the "because/therefore" linkage for the moonbeam jar's decisive role.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: Elias abandons the room with spheres, his thawed heart pulsing toward floods. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density shift in final narration—"melting dawn" crystallizes reconfigured stakes without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("phobias raw but harnessed"); causal lens holds tightly from seashell's guidance to trap activation, though Mara's sudden lunge feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (booklet closed against void) lands with conceptual cost via flaking gold, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—storm pressure never alters tactics. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost legibility falters in "enriching the hush" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Eko’s realization that "thoughts originated in amalgamation" reconfigures options with visible cost (violin warming against frost, revealing hidden blooms). Orientation anchors by line 3, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently. Minor slip: "method of looped timelines proving flawless" edges toward convenient resolution, slightly diluting earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with Elias' ice melting and spirit unbound; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through escalating vision density, though the timeframe transition lacks precise causal anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: nightly marble-polishing rituals deepen pressure toward Charged Poise climax where blooming vines reconfigure luck's meaning. Cost is undeniable in "Thorne fled, his luck score shattered" amid "leaves whispered of coming wither".

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds sensory density toward Conceptual Repricing, but lens ambiguity past midpoint weakens causality. Cost (temporal eddy threat) lands cleanly, though disorientation in early nexus description risks orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with strong Charged Poise closure. Water damage evolution and sonic disruption create valid pressure, but "lately inspired" motivation lacks causal linkage to the disruptive choice, slightly muddying cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("exhaled, lighter now"), but botanical illustration's sudden introduction lacks causal anchoring; fever break timeframe doesn't tighten temporal pressure despite stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (burden release via valve turn) lands with conceptual cost (swallowed truth reinterpreted), but Hybrid lens falters at midpoint: radio calls' thematic mirroring feels coincidental rather than causally integrated, weakening escalation under Situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: keeper's return to the library crystallizes his eternal cycle with conceptual cost ("fractures in his loosely gripped reality" mended by silence). Accumulative lens holds as seasonal observations deepen purpose without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Finn's tearful touch of the hair curl during eclipse reconfigures "ordinary magic" with felt cost (sun's return mirroring fragile hope), under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (exhausted dreams), but the "stirrings of hope" lacks visceral legibility; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though pressure lacks meaningful deepening beyond discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("voice trembling with relief"), but microdot mechanics feel convenient—no resistance during cookie placement weakens causal pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost ("Elias exhaled") under Accumulative/Textural lens, but time pressure ("unseen hour") lacks tracking, weakening escalation’s causal logic despite strong density buildup to the indigo pulse climax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elias succeeds "before exhaustion hit" with visible cost (physical depletion), reconfiguring time's arrow under Accumulative lens; dawn's arrival tightens options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "touched ground for the first time, mortal, free" crystallizes the cyclical struggle; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density of failed timelines tightens pressure toward the child confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orientation solid by line 15 ("drum maker’s cavern...Elias the deaf music teacher"). Closure is Charged Poise: "filament of hush lingered" crystallizes cost of defeated numbness with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held impeccably through density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Elias' refastening of the tube crystallizes stance crystallization with visible cost ("shatter his solitude") under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the escalation lacks one tighter causal pressure point before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis when Elias kneels sobbing amid crystal shadows, sealing the vial with hard-won understanding—the felt cost is visceral in "tears welled as he understood." Minor over-explanation in final line slightly dulls the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("vanishing... forever chasing time's weave") crystallizes options with undeniable cost—perpetual pursuit preserving humanity but forgoing resolution. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: layering (quartz/memories) → patterning (rope symbols) → escape, though lens teaching could be tighter pre-grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "echoes lingered, testament to unbound hearts" reconfigures the chronic hush with conceptual cost of eternal incompletion. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the unbinding moment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with dawn departure and "enduring tapestry" image, but backstory fragment slightly over-explains the cargo handler; orientation perfect by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—no visible sacrifice for belonging. Backstory reflection exceeds BRR limits, summarizing without altering tactics mid-search.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: pendant cooling signifies borrowed-time consequence while harmony is preserved. Accumulative lens holds as cadence dissonance intensifies texture; "suspended like a chord" early motif reweights closure. Cost legible in "giant's nap extended across borrowed time" with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: vision reveals Mira's non-absolute loss but forecloses certainty, crystallizing options through the mosaic's reconfigured patterns. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation to the vision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (ending self-imposed invisibility) under Accumulative lens; wartime reflection risks BRR violation but memory directly triggers present action toward woman.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "hair turning to delicate tendrils" and "bark-like yet flexible" skin; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to surrender moment.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: brooch handover crystallizes "meaning through connection" with conceptual cost (relinquishing artifact for narrative fuel). Accumulative lens holds through density of converging artifacts; cost legible in "tell me her story" exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (limited clairvoyance exposed), but cost legibility weakens slightly in the inhabitation sequence; "felt inevitable" risks telling over showing the emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation Test fails (142 words to establish setting), triggering -0.4 penalty; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with effective Charged Poise closure where "people no longer adrift but anchored" conveys conceptual cost of exile transformed into collective purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise at fortress entrance, but cost remains conceptual; "shattered bad habits" lacks on-page legibility. Orientation anchors ("abandoned train yard," "midnight") clear by paragraph 1.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens succeeds with emotional reconfiguration, but cost proof fails: no concrete on-page image shows legible cost (e.g., "burdensome tangle" is abstract; Kai's absence remains implied not dramatized).

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost—amulet shatters—but "boredom tempered" lacks visceral legibility. Orientation succeeds early, yet cost proof falters: emotional consequence feels intellectualized, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when digital signature "liquefies bureaucratic intransigence" with undeniable conceptual cost (alerts coming but math holds). Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds perfectly through midnight breach.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence was no accident" realization reconfigures stakes with felt cost (sharpened motivation amid solitude); accumulative lens holds through humming escalation to dawn's break.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "nameless identity became a strength" reconfigures erasure with conceptual cost, though tidal rhythm’s pressure escalation remains atmospheric rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with the seashell's dissolution charging the cost, though the cello method's sudden appearance weakens causal escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: dawn breaking with the raft's pulse strengthening after corporate envoy's arrival. Cost is visceral in "desperation clawed" versus communal resolve at the mural. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density of encoded graffiti tightens options as scouts circle, reweighting unity as the only path.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost ("weight of what she'd outlasted"). Lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.4) for delayed pattern-teaching of chemical messages. Cost proof solid in final descent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (Elias’s enduring blindness enabling others’ sight), yet the Accumulative lens ambiguity precludes 9.0 despite resonant refraction payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Elias stepping onto the ice crystallizes options with felt cost ("personal reckoning" and "worrying tranquility" as shroud)—though the conceptual cost of isolation isn’t viscerally paid beyond implication in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("balance was fragile but now shared"), but the tremors' easing lacks visceral legibility. Accumulative lens holds, yet "collapse" threat remains abstract without concrete on-page stakes escalation at the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s triumph crystallizes with undeniable cost (impending death) under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by 80 words; pressure escalates via sensory density and oxygen depletion. Cost proof: "time ran short, but she had tamed the ephemeral" makes sacrifice legible.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density builds to Earned Stasis ("impossible calm sustained"). Cost legible in "bodies would soon be found" juxtaposed with serene repose, though pressure escalation lacks micro-tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation debt: "endless night" and fogged glass delay anchoring who/where/when past 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (bead still, fields thawing), but ambiguity in the Accumulative lens early caps score despite strong cost ("sweet poison" draining Elias).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: transformed labyrinth (bridged chasm, orchid garden) proves labor's tangible impact. Accumulative lens holds through patterned sleepwalking overlaps that deepen communal mending, though sleepwalking mechanics' motivation remains slightly opaque yet fitting for textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost (exile's spiritual theft), but lens ambiguity past midpoint weakens escalation; "roots twitching" moment lacks causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lacks legible cost: "savoring dawn's promise" avoids stakes. Lens ambiguity persists past midpoint despite Accumulative/Textural lean. Orientation clear but cost proof fails.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lacks unmistakable cost—"might yet echo into silence" implies soft reset; Accumulative lens holds but Earned Stasis fails as no tangible forfeiture occurs on-page during unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "stepped out, ready to decide anew" crystallizes stance with visible cost ("scars," "wounds stirring"), though the Accumulative lens risks thin escalation; the single deepening (tracing messages) suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise: "hope transformed into gentle light" crystallizes options with visible cost (shared anxieties becoming seeds). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory/emotional density, not causality. Mist lift at twilight reweights stakes without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (joy remains veiled), but cost legibility falters—no exact sentence shows price paid for rediscovery; fog thinning implies loss without tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but nested awakenings repeat without deepening stakes. One distinct non-closure issue (repetitive escalation) triggers -0.8 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: final image ("planted... revolution") reweights rebellion as organic proliferation with visible cost (drones crashing, enforcers' neural confusion). Late bioengineering reveal slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("insomnia eased at last"), but temporal compression obscures escalation; accumulation lens holds though centuries-long process feels undifferentiated.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("fleeting bloom"), but cost proof fails—the "scar of purpose" image implies cost without showing its tangible effect on Elara's actions or options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Thorne's "I see now" and ink well dimming, but cost remains abstract ("weight lifting like fog") without concrete on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("measured mercy"), but adhesive analysis breaks causality—composition noted off-page via "portable lens" without process. Lens ambiguity pre-midpoint caps high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("tears bloomed... withering fear giving way to renewal") under Accumulative lens, though meteorite's "alien glow" infusion edges toward convenient resolution rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (Elias accepting transience of magic) holds under Situational lens, but cost is abstract: "whispers of magical happenstance" lacks concrete forfeiture. Pressure crystallizes stance, yet the tidy dispersal undermines felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"body rooted while spirit lifts" crystallizes exile's cost under Accumulative lens; gaps widening to spontaneous anchoring creates undeniable pressure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "cherish the mundane" realization carries conceptual cost (impending loss of bay's essence), with Accumulative/Textural lens held through ripple patterns tightening pressure; mist lifting to reveal rainbows crystallizes reconfigured stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but cost proof is oblique: "Mia's tears" lacks visceral specificity to fully satisfy cost test. Orientation solid within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure succeeds with visible cost ("ruin profits, expose schemes") but echo causing rain weakens causal lens; thunder's "resumption" feels coincidental rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens (snow swirl reconfiguring serenity), but cost remains abstract. Fails cost proof test—no on-page consequence for releasing echoes beyond atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of ethical exploration settle like a quiet starfall"), but the causal leap from argument to reversal lacks one concrete trigger—what specific memory or detail finally cracks his denial?

    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: monarch's perch crystallizes stance shift with felt cost (transient roots pulling free), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where density intensifies through disrupted cadence; orientation anchors by line 20 satisfy the test.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost (tears, emotional thaw), but "after forgiving yourself" repetition creates scaffold loop that slightly dulls the final image's resonance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory build to resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("paths chose those ready to let directives decay"), but reflection-to-dream transition lacks causal trigger ("her gift demanded reflection, so she settled...") weakening escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens; storm pressure tightens stakes but doesn't alter her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively: the fog transforming from "shroud" to "guardian" crystallizes irreversible emotional cost with visible stakes, while the Causal lens holds through precise cause-effect (breath sync → boundary dissolution) without causality breaks, and the sextant's constraint shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the fused ribbon crystallizes generational renewal through accidental spillage, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens via density shift in the notebook’s fall.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis (curating nonlinear threads despite erasure risk), with conceptual cost in "shadows lengthened in his mind."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: renegotiated vow alters future missions with conceptual cost ("eternal secrecy" modified), but botanical diary solution edges toward convenient causality in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative lens holds with density increase; Charged Poise closure lands via fog-parting cost, though "as memories alter" refrain edges toward mechanical loop despite thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is flawless Charged Poise: merged rope stabilizes the door, filling absences with reconstructed truths while cost ("cacophony of what-ifs" threatening overwhelm) is felt.

    Closure succeeds as a Charged Poise: Mira’s handed-back vial and relaxed shoulders crystallize the cost of embracing silence, with the terrace’s hush reconfigured as comfort. However, the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks a distinct mid-scene deepening—Elias’s noise-monitoring tactics feel iterative rather than escalating pressure, slightly blurring the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with sunrise deadline as felt cost, but temporal pressure lacks tangible consequences—horizon's "pre-dawn glow" threatens without altering tactics, weakening cost proof at apex.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "loaded emptiness now lighter" reconfigures sanctuary's meaning with felt cost (Lorin's cleared eyes), but escalation lacks agency-driven pressure under Accumulative lens; Lorin's arrival relies on convenient scar-linking.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: bolt twist compresses pressure into diamonds with unmistakable cost ("pressure mounted, squeezing her"). Orientation anchors by word 20. Minor flaw—bolt retrieval feels slightly facile despite lever improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with visible cost ("dynasty truly ended... eloquent silence"), but lens ambiguity in mid-scene (causal vs accumulative pressure) slightly undermines escalation coherence before the spectral voice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks unmistakable cost legibility; "dawn's illusion" reconfiguration feels abstract without concrete forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative) holds but escalation density insufficient for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—"broken heart stir with possibility" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost, though dust-trail discovery edges toward coincidence under Accumulative lens; final cost legible in dust-removal action.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "seed of resistance had taken root" shows irreversible conceptual cost under causal lens. Minor flaw: broadcast glitch resolution slightly convenient despite resourcefulness, diluting cost legibility by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "lingering mist" reconfiguring prophecy's threat, but cost ("eerie nostalgia settling like dew") feels conceptual rather than visceral; Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through negative space escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as Thorne dissolves into light, but cost legibility falters—centuries of regret lift via stated "luminous ache lifted" rather than visceral imagery (e.g., the tooth's physical transformation could anchor the cost more concretely).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure fails cost proof test: no visible price paid for resolution as she walks away "displaced no more" with symmetric formula. Strong early orientation anchors disorientation payoff, but accumulative lens collapses when trauma response yields tidy mathematical solution without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: voices echoing with "weight lift" reconfigures stakes under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: "weightless burden lifted" crystallizes lifelong struggle. Accumulative lens holds—density increase (ghost manifestations) forces stance crystallization. Cost proof: "leaving him in quiet solitude" charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (fragility exposed), but "sealing bottle anew" lacks visible trade-off to sharpen Earned Stasis. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through frost patterns to rupture, though causal linkage to compression feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Elias clutches the shard amid settling time-veils, crystallizing redemption through reimagining—but "time became visible" concept arrives past 120 words, creating brief orientation debt that weakens early causality anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis (light restored, covenant renewed) with visible cost: midnight's "whispering lies" cause ferns to wilt, forcing Elias to confront doubt.

    Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: absences quantified through cloud swirls/gaps build density toward Charged Poise closure. Cost unmistakable as Elara "quantified her own absence" and releases identity into void at nexus.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (physical/emotional toll of subsuming remorse), causal chain holds under Accumulative lens via tidal pool method, though "dream's haze lending unnatural strength" slightly undermines causality at dig climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise: cuckoo weight chiming multilingual snippets) lands with conceptual cost (repurposed object's new purpose). Causality frays in key beat—affixing weight magically amplifies grain talks without mechanical logic—but Accumulative lens holds via linguistic resonance. Orientation clear by paragraph 1 anchors stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands under Accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract (trembling hands lack concrete forfeiture); seismic "urging" undermines pressure escalation by resolving inner turmoil through coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong Charged Poise closure with gravity normalization cost, but "threshold effects" mechanics arrive late without early signal. Inversion rules established sufficiently for single-turn escalation under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the grove’s resonance crystallizes options with visible cost (Elara’s tears, "wound" of silence). Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly as crack-analysis density builds toward the hum’s emergence without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost in "hopeful melancholy" reconfiguration, but "translating silence" method arrives past midpoint (40%), risking lens ambiguity for Accumulative design despite coherent pressure build.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("tears welling," trembling clasp), but Accumulative lens ambiguity emerges midway when cataloging shifts to recovery without clear pattern teaching; cost proof remains undeniable in "mended an invisible rift."

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds—enduring the stench forecloses fleeing with felt cost ("breathed it in, finding... strange purity")—but the cost isn’t deepened enough to reach 9.0; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density peaking at bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is Earned Stasis (arrow secured for renewal), but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence/image concretizing loss. "Wilted grove" isn't reweighted; gravity normalization feels like reset, not paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (city's silence vs. patch/charts promise), but cost legibility falters at "scarred horizon" image—feels observational rather than Mara's personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands (shadows transformed into renewal visions), but cost remains abstract "unseen change" rather than felt forfeiture. Lens ambiguity: accumulative buildup weakens situational pressure at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Valid Conceptual Repricing closure (reflection redefining identity) has conceptual cost, but "tracking sun trails" lacks causal motivation—tea house mistress' instruction functions as mystical fiat without escalation pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: storm waning/moonlight dominating crystallizes Elias's stance shift with visible cost (buried sorrows beginning to heal). Accumulative lens holds; orientation clear by paragraph 1 with no disorientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with true dawn manifestation, but cost remains abstract ("trembling hands" insufficient); accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks density shifts in high-pressure ritual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)

    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: mosaic reveal reconfigures decay into sacredness with conceptual cost (buried guilt redeemed), though the "tenuous absolution" cost feels slightly abstract versus tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (trembling hands sealing vials), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful deepening; vows sampled follow identical pattern without narrowing options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change when trust shatters ("gasping fist"), with visible cost in abandoned shipment. Causal escalation tightens options cleanly, though merchant's sudden doubt slightly strains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("skepticism softened"), and causal lens holds through ring activation to convergence, though the ring's sudden efficacy slightly strains causality at the climax beat.

    Strong Charged Poise closure: "gliding over dunes... whole in her pieced-together soul" reconfigures stakes with felt cost (abandoned farm). Situational lens holds—magnetic shift forces stance crystallization—but resolution edges on coincidence (fire self-extinguishes too neatly).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: unlocked letters yield healing with visible cost (tears, softened grief). Causal lens holds—locket → interviews → key discovery—but sirens intrusion feels unearned coincidence. Orientation anchors desert town/thrift shop by 98 words; cost proof lies in Mr. Ramirez recognizing his father's handwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("vulnerabilities encrypted as strength"), but cost proof is oblique—no exact line shows sacrificed option beyond abstract transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("holes in his soul"), under Accumulative lens. Orientation solid by para 2, but coffee-ground method feels slightly convenient despite "old seers" setup; minor causality dip in how gravity shifts specifically form the map.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the prophecy's "grip loosen[s]" with the visceral cost of "blaze of motivation cooling to embers," under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens where mapped silences accumulate density to reweight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost ("weight of isolation lift, transformed into independence"), but accumulative lens escalation lacks sufficient density increase in pivotal beat; "ghostly resolve" remains conceptual rather than dramatized pressure shift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands via Charged Poise—"weight lift from her soul" crystallizes forgiveness with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through drip motif, but "calibrated precision" slightly over-explains the dissolution moment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("heart heavy with understanding"), but Thorne's sudden confession and seashell mechanics feel retroactively convenient, triggering -0.8 Non-closure Accumulation Cap for one distinct causality slip near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost (truth must avoid "blame's sharp edges"), but escalation lacks pressure spikes—dream accounts summarized rather than dramatized as active investigation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though density increase feels slight.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost (lifelong quest crystallized in quiet testimony); Accumulative lens holds via sound-fragment accumulation; minor deduction as pressure stems from crystal's gifts rather than Elias' active choices narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "chalk crumbling in his hand" showing cost; Accumulative lens holds via fog/chalk/driftwood pattern accumulation; vision flicker serves as adequate escalation but feels underweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: restructured clock creates legible before/after with felt cost ("luminous ache transformed"). Accumulative lens holds through tremor escalation, though seismic threat resolves too cleanly ("observatory held") muting tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise through the final image of Elias's peaceful thrum and the shard in Elara's pocket, with legible cost in his tears and the daughter's lined face.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the luminous map’s creation reconfigures options with felt cost ("tears froze"), but eclipse timing as external pressure slightly dilutes protagonist agency in the Accumulative/Textural lens dominant at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias emerges with the timer, having "turned reflection into reason," but the conceptual cost ("quiet wounds of life") remains stated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the dissolving signature reweights the time-travel premise with conceptual cost—but the Orientation Test anchor (who/where/when) arrives at 112 words, narrowly avoiding penalty while creating initial disorientation that slightly muddies early causality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: hybrid form crystallizes with felt cost ("heart beating in sync with Thorne's revived pulse"). Lens is Accumulative/Textural (sensory density → cosmic intimacy), holding through final soar. Cost proof clear in "reluctant metamorphosis completing" and stabilized hybrid state.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: saucer’s widening crack absorbs pain to unfasten regret, crystallizing stakes with visible cost in "tears mingled with choking beauty." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "willingly perplexed" concept dissipates during ritual escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: portal blooming with "ghostly figures emerging" reconfigures stakes with visible cost (emotional labor of shadow integration). Accumulative lens holds through patterned deepening, though repetitive photo structure slightly dilutes escalation pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with felt cost ("gritty shift from loss to renewal"), but prophecy resolution via coincidence violates "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule, weakening causal escalation at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lacks visible cost: revolution succeeds "so quiet, the council would awaken to a world already transformed" with no sacrifice or consequence shown; blackout remains "fortunate anomaly," violating cost proof test for causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Elara's anchoring forecloses escape with visible cost ("elusiveness waned"), under Accumulative lens where pattern density crystallizes stakes; tidal forces reconfigure options irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: sealing the rarefied poem with "storm-kissed wonder" crystallizes endurance with conceptual cost (censorship’s shadows persist), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through atmospheric reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly: waiting→contact→duel forms clean because/therefore chain; Earned Stasis closure lands with visceral cost in rapier skittering into brook.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (Jax's execution as "contraband hope"), but lens ambiguity pre-midpoint—shifts from causal (molting) to accumulative (memory layering)—triggers -0.4 penalty. Orientation clear by word 30 ("rusted library under stars").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via mended clock and stabilized compasses, reweighting fate's rigidity with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup; cost legible in "clock lay whole... ticking softly" crystallizing irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: sprouting seed + thunder creates undeniable pressure with visible cost (time running out). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of dream-library imagery deepens stakes without causal breaks. Final cost ("monsoon eroded the ridge") legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "remnants of sorrow carried away" as he prunes bonsai anew. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—lace instructions deepen remembrance's rhythm until horizon-pointing compass crystallizes reconfiguration.
