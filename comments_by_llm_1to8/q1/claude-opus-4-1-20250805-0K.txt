    Marina's motivation to protect against her father's poisoned legacy is concrete and drives her final choice to warn others. The reflection on her father's illness and her years trying to replicate his glow earns the pivot to safe beauty, though the frost-as-teacher epiphany arrives slightly prepackaged. Internal contradiction surfaces when she wrestles with destroying versus using the ledger, and her decision to walk deeper into the canyon forecloses her old identity with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slips into abstracted phrasing ("recognition" as trembling cause).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—translating silence into thermal music—but her interiority leans toward elevated register ("rectify what the silence had stolen") that occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy. Internal conflict is present (grief over lost crewmates, tears at dawn) but could deepen through more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously rather than sequentially. The choice to document thermal patterns feels more like continuation than a peak decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices (selecting tuning forks, working through the night) reveal values but lack the friction of competing goods at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Silas's interior life is largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The insomnia curse is asserted but never shown constraining a choice or producing embodied struggle under pressure. His transformation at the end—finding rest by giving it—reads as thematic declaration rather than earned through on-page friction between want and cost. The Sleepless Librarians remain atmospheric devices without individual agency or pressure on Silas's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta's interior logic is consistent and her "gently persistent" trait shapes her midnight runs, but her motivations remain largely declared rather than tested under genuine pressure. The piece offers embodied moments ("weathered hands paused on the bell rope") yet the protagonist faces no meaningful internal conflict—her values align seamlessly with outcomes. Samuel and the community remain functional placeholders without distinct voices or contradictory impulses. The ending renunciation (stepping back) carries conceptual weight but lacks visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mae's motivations are present but overly abstract—her journey toward "where unused love is stored" remains metaphysically distant rather than felt through embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is largely absent; she moves through the sequence without genuine hesitation or competing impulses. The ghost woman's appearance and the final "giving" turn lack sufficient causal groundwork in Mae's psychology, reading more like submission to mystical instruction than a choice born from her own contradictory desires. The breathing-pattern mechanic substitutes for earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara's motivation to understand time's texture is told rather than dramatized through competing wants. Interior voice relies heavily on abstract metaphysical assertions ("retrocognitive imprisonment," "time's texture") that read as concept labels rather than embodied experience under pressure. The final laugh and release feel unearned—no visible cost forecloses a path, no contradiction between impulses forces a trade-off. The protagonist observes and contemplates but makes no difficult choice that alters her stance with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's interiority relies on summary rather than embodied contradiction ("patience had always been Marcus's greatest strength" tells rather than showing through micro-choices under pressure). His three-year wait is described but not dramatized with visible internal conflict or cost until the escape itself. The final paragraph's "staggering grace" and "weight of ten thousand possible futures" slides into elevated abstraction that doesn't feel earned by prior particular struggle. Motivation is coherent but remains largely uncontested—no moment where his resolve wavers or competes with a live alternative desire.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation is clear and her synesthesia provides concrete sensory texture, but her interiority relies heavily on metaphor and philosophical observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandfather exists entirely in backstory and reflection; no secondary character applies immediate pressure. The final realization—that trust breaking and trust being born share the same frequency—feels more like an epiphany declared than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but abstract rather than embodied in competing micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cassia's occupation is vividly drawn and her motivations ("not theft, but archaeology of light") are clear, but her interiority remains largely expository rather than embodied. The mother's grief is told more than shown through micro-choices. The protagonist's expertise ("years of studying how light could be bottled") appears as backstory summary rather than constraint-driven struggle, and the final exchange about bearing truth reads slightly diagnostic rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority shows depth through her self-narration ritual and concrete decisions to place spheres, but her motivation lacks sufficient internal contradiction—the choice to return and create feels pre-decided without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The couple's entrance provides relationship pressure, yet their interaction remains brief and illustrative rather than testing Marina's stance with cost. Embodied emotion is present in gestures with the bookmark and torch, but the therapy-adjacent language ("hearts learning to thaw," "safe vessels for unspoken questions") flattens several beats that warrant more particular embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marcus's journey from stunt double to synthetic being operates largely through exposition rather than embodied struggle. The phobias are told as safeguards rather than shown constraining choices under pressure; when he decrypts the equations "during the drive here," we lose the chance to watch him wrestle with fear transforming into method. The final confrontation hinges on a reversal sequence that arrives fully formed rather than earned through on-page micro-choices. Interior contradiction is present (fear as weakness vs. weapon) but remains at the thesis level without the hypocrisy or self-deception that would make it breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oracle is established with a specific obsession (seven years watching a star), but her interior life remains abstract. The decision to close the booklet and return tomorrow reads as contemplative endurance rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin—"she smiled" does the work without layered contradiction. The realization that "the star would not die tonight" lacks the causal grounding or micro-choices that would earn the shift from obsession to patience.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seven's motivation—seeking the origin of thoughts—is clear and drives his choices. The consciousness emerging from "spaces between actions" reads as earned through the temporal-perception procedure and his patient observation. However, the piece leans on abstract labels ("consciousness," "thoughts," "sentience") rather than contradictory embodied impulses in scene. The final return to mopping with "each stroke contained multitudes" gestures toward transformation but doesn't dramatize a foreclosed path or visible cost—he simply continues, now enlightened.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority carries consistent voice and her micro-choices (approaching, confessing eavesdropping, completing the doodles) show agency under pressure. Internal conflict between protecting Marcus and honesty is stated but not simultaneously dramatized—choices alternate rather than collide in-scene. Samuel remains functional but flat; his protective sacrifice is told rather than shown wrestling with cost. The final reconciliation feels unmotivated by on-page struggle; trust thaws via confession exchange without visible friction or residual doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta's interior voice is concrete and specific ("gardens know their gardeners"), her lies to plants are character-particular, and her forty-year relationship with the maze grounds her motives. The young woman at the end feels functional but not deeply internalized; her rejection letter and skepticism are sketched rather than embodied. Marta's core contradiction—lying with such conviction that reality bends—drives visible choices (telling jasmine it's an oak, convincing a rose it's sleeping), but the final act of handing over the marble lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path for Marta herself.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Ira's motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. Her actions follow a smooth technical path without struggle or cost to personal values. The "subdued awakenings" of the creatures and her own temporal observations remain abstract rather than forcing hard choices. Dr. Vasquez's alarm is deflected without consequence, so no relationship pressure shapes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and his interiority shows embodied connection to the music and space. His choices to return nightly and transcribe alone demonstrate agency. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than earned—his understanding of Elisabetta's need arrives suddenly ("Marcus understood then what she needed") without prior internal conflict or contradiction. The final state where he's "perfectly dry" holding a "restored" program reads as convenient reversal rather than visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's oracle gift is embodied through concrete choices—staying at the station, occupying margins, drawing and smudging the illustration. Her interiority shows contradictory impulses (the need to protect versus document) acting simultaneously. The final choice to smudge her signature and descend carries visible cost: she protects the truth by ensuring it remains marginal, foreclosing official recognition. Minor slip: some interior moments ("swallowed this truth during her fever, incorporated it somehow into her body's knowledge") edge toward abstract label-speak rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus shows consistent interiority filtered through his Methodist skepticism and urban-explorer pragmatism. His decision not to touch the valve wheel is motivated by established values ("respect the stories places told through their decay") and represents a meaningful stance crystallization with visible cost—he forgoes physical proof for documentary witnessing. The drowsy alertness functions as both embodied state and perceptual filter. Minor: the "question everything twice, then question the questions" formulation reads slightly precious but doesn't flatten the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The chronicle keeper remains wholly passive—a witness who "never ceased their work" yet makes no on-page choices that alter tactics or foreclose options. Interiority consists of abstract philosophical summary ("truth bent like light through water") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The explorers who arrive provoke no genuine conflict; she hands them paper and demonstrates folding without stakes. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost appears; the ending restates her static witness role without dramatizing what path was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's characterization is consistent and her music therapist role informs her perceptual filter, but internal conflict remains largely abstract. The reconciliation arc with Sofia is told rather than tested in scene; we're informed of "teenage rebellion and reconciliation" but never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously under pressure. Micro-choices like holding up the curl and playing the flute are present but feel more ritual than renunciation with visible cost. The therapy-speak intrusion ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance" used as diagnostic labels) slightly flattens interiority at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thrain's sensitivity is embodied through tactile detail ("fingers trailing," "feel the words") and her role as keeper creates coherent motivation. Internal experience shows her perceptual gift expanding ("opened fully") and driving the climactic realization about the axis displacement. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; her final choice to "continue her work" reads as continuity rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The emotional arc lacks contradiction or struggle—she moves smoothly from discovery to understanding without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Chen Li's interior is detailed but remains declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The twenty-year backstory and his "peculiar gift" are told rather than shown constraining choices on the page. The final decision to disappear carries thematic weight but arrives without visible internal contradiction or struggle—he simply "understood" and "stepped through." Emotional states are asserted ("smiled at the familiar enigma") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is motivated by a clear philosophical stance (silence as truth-bearer) and his choices create the exorcism's arc. Interior texture is consistent—his perceptual signature favors architectural metaphor and sonic layering—but the woman's transformation lacks embodied cost; we're told she "gasped" and "remembered," not shown a micro-choice under pressure. The demon's nature (feeding on unexamined certainties) remains abstract rather than dramatized through her specific struggle. Final renunciation reads earned in concept but thin in felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mei's interior world is richly atmospheric but relies heavily on abstract concepts ("chronologically homesick," "temporal perception") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to conduct unheard symphonies is told through reflection rather than dramatized through competing impulses that create visible struggle. The final choice—raising arms for crescendo—lacks earned friction; we don't see what she risks or forecloses by this gesture. Interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than character-particular thought patterns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's interior life is rich with contradictory impulses—the desire to escape versus the need to integrate—but the embodiment remains abstract. The climactic choice to press the "collapse" rune feels earned by prior fractured experience, yet the moment lacks visceral hesitation or micro-choices that would reveal her hierarchy of values. Emotional progression relies heavily on concept-language ("fractures but facets," "labyrinth of self") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The elder-Kira encounter provides external pressure but resolves too cleanly without cost friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lucia's interior landscape is specific and embodied ("spreading numbness," feeling vibrations through bone), and her search for connection through backward recordings is well-motivated. The final transformation from numbness to feeling is earned through the repeated pattern of reversed music interacting with stone. However, her journey lacks meaningful internal contradiction or trade-off—the phonograph experiment succeeds without setback, and the thawing feels inevitable rather than fought-for. The absence of on-page struggle or competing impulses caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's motivation is consistently rooted in meticulous observation and scientific integrity, with the decision to continue her work and establish new stations driven by character rather than plot convenience. Her interiority shows embodied detail ("fingers worked methodically," calibrating instruments "by lamplight") and her choice to reply carries visible cost—she commits to active resistance rather than passive documentation. Minor weakness: the internal contradiction between solitary integrity and revolutionary engagement could have been dramatized through a more conflicted micro-choice rather than resolved so smoothly. The follower sequence establishes her tactical intelligence, and her progression from assumed indifference to suspected suppression feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.2)
    Marcus's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("moral edges," "poet's hunger") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to replace the rope feels unmotivated—no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from the choice. The energy beings remain unexplained conveniences that grant revelation without resistance. Internal conflict is asserted ("impossible choices") but never dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's choice to play and her understanding of incompletion show embodied motivation. The grandmother's teaching ("You must learn to hear what wants to emerge, not force what you think should be") grounds her arc, and the final smile with comprehension earns the shift. Minor slip: the acoustically perceptive gift is mentioned but not dramatized through a specific micro-choice that tests it under pressure. The community's arrival feels reactive rather than driven by distinct secondary motives.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is specific and consistent—she harvests emotions with "affectionate detachment" and resists consuming her merchandise—but the final choice to simply tuck the petal away and leave feels unmotivated by the inner pull she describes. The contradictory impulse to "subsume these emotions herself" is named but never dramatizes genuine friction; she invokes her "cardinal rule" without visible cost or hesitation. The widower client is introduced only in her thought, diluting the present stakes. Embodied moments ("static electricity crackling," hair standing on end) anchor perception, but the emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margot's shift from business efficiency to emotional engagement is clear but mostly told through reflection rather than enacted under pressure. The letter's emotional weight is described ("Margot's breath caught") rather than embodied through competing impulses in the moment. Martha's introduction adds relationship dynamics, but the core transformation—Margot finding her place in cycles of compassion—arrives through summary ("understanding finally") instead of a decisive choice that forecloses a visible alternative. Interior voice remains consistent but leans toward abstract insight over concrete contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's dedication is asserted but her internal contradiction never crystallizes in scene—she pursues community grafting without visible friction between want and cost until the final tableau hands her success. The ancient artist's self-exile is told rather than dramatized, and her tears arrive on cue without prior embodied resistance. The village youth remain interchangeable ciphers (Maria's translations, Javi's climbing) whose micro-choices never constrain Kira's path. The ending grants belonging without foreclosing a live option or showing what Kira relinquished to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority remains thin throughout—she observes and acts without substantial internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The final choice to complete the drawings feels efficient rather than wrenching; no visible cost or foreclosed path materializes on the page beyond the cracked pendant. Minor: the time-sculptors' panic is told rather than shown through individuated reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Morrow's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete (phosphorescent pigments, months of mapping), but her emotional progression remains abstract—"buried optimism...bloom into understanding" is summary rather than embodied contradiction. The mentor Elias is told rather than shown; his vanishing and transformation into "emotional mathematics" sidesteps the earned grief or anger that would render Morrow's search visceral. The final acceptance ("absence...was just another form of presence") reads as epiphany declared rather than a choice with visible cost, leaving her agency untested.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Edgar's interiority is specific and embodied—the copper pipe's coolness, the sense memories from tape fragments. His contradictory impulses (hiding versus yearning to connect) drive choices with visible cost: thirty-seven years of isolation versus the risk of leaving fragments for the archivist. The final choice to leave the rest tomorrow is earned by the revelation that she's been conducting the same rescue operation, though the ending hedges slightly with "perhaps" rather than full commitment. Minor deduction for the therapeutic framing of "becoming visible" as stated goal rather than fully dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is grounded in decades of study, and his interiority shifts from resistance to acceptance through embodied markers (greenish nails, root-like lines under skin). The grandmother's warnings anchor his transformation in family history with clear foreshadowing. However, the key choice—accepting the leaf's merger—lacks meaningful internal conflict; he simply "didn't pull away" without dramatizing competing impulses or visible cost at the moment of surrender. The final stance feels declared rather than earned through contradictory desires acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's sleep-deprived state is embodied through thick tongue and heavy fingers, and her choice to trade the brooch despite "three generations" carries visible emotional cost. The woman's daughter appears only in reported speech, yet her grief drives the exchange with credible specificity. Internal contradiction surfaces when Mara seeks "truth instead of merely survival" while still gripping survival's token, though this could deepen further. Minor slip: the phrase "metallic hollowness" trends toward diagnostic label-speak but remains anchored in the post-war context.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's transformation is dramatized through concrete sensory shifts (the pearl dissolving into her palm, feeling the cave's history), and her gift's blindness creates genuine interior conflict. However, the epiphany arrives largely through exposition rather than difficult choice—she passively receives wisdom from the shadow-presence rather than earning it through contradiction or cost. The pilgrim functions more as a convenient catalyst than a character who applies pressure. Micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy are absent; Vera's arc follows a predetermined enlightenment template without visible struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kessa's motivation to compile fragments is consistent and her archive work shows purposeful micro-choices (arranging documents emotionally, incorporating the valve's whispered percussion). However, her interiority remains largely abstract—we get conceptual statements about absence and grammar rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final valve-turn reads as symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Matthias appears briefly but applies no pressure that forces Kessa to alter her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority reads as well-crafted but static; her cartographer/artistic duality is labeled ("analytical mind...artistic soul") rather than embodied through contradictory choices under pressure. The trajectory from trembling uncertainty to steady purpose is asserted in summary fashion ("trembling certainty transformed into steady purpose") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths. The fortress visit feels like a field trip; no internal conflict shapes whether she enters or what she risks by documenting it. Embodiment is present ("fingers trembled," "boot precisely where the crack began") but emotional progression remains declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's skepticism is credibly rooted and her move toward integration emerges gradually through handling the tile and transcribing whale songs. However, interiority leans toward abstraction ("memories that weren't quite hers," "entangled in ways that defied linear explanation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to integrate her grandmother's legacy feels more declared than earned through visible on-page cost; the renunciation of pure skepticism lacks a dramatized trade-off or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is thin—most feelings are summarized ("voice wavered," "smile") rather than shown through action or bodily sensation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vex's immortal weariness is established through concrete detail ("twelve thousand years," "third millennium"), but her internal contradiction—wanting death yet helping the mutiny—is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to step through lacks visible cost; she simply smiles and agrees after centuries of stagnation. Thorne and crew are functionally identical voices serving plot rather than individuals with distinct stakes. The amulet choice feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her "cursed honesty" manifests in precise micro-choices (working restoration cream, threading needle) that reveal hierarchy of values. The father remains vivid through backstory filtered through present action, and Wei's transformation from "inherited rage" to trembling acceptance is embodied. Internal contradiction appears ("subtracting his sins from her love") but could deepen if dramatized earlier; the final calculation feels slightly imposed rather than discovered through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stationer remains passive throughout, observing and documenting without making a consequential choice that forecloses a path. Her "earnestly studious" preparations and measurements feel more like enacted profession than interior conflict. The monk's silent understanding and the closing plan to return next season suggest stasis rather than alteration. Interiority consists largely of exposition about her trade rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mari's interior world is richly textured through her filter of memory perception and bureaucratic dissolution, with strong embodied moments (the poison label as compass, pressing against cold metal). However, the piece largely observes rather than forces Mari into high-stakes micro-choices under pressure—she moves through the container maze collecting annotations without meaningful internal contradiction or difficult trade-offs. The final signing of names carries symbolic weight but lacks the visible cost of a renunciation or choice that forecloses a lived path. The character reads as contemplative witness rather than agent tested by conflicting impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's myth-busting stance is established early but her interiority remains thin—we get occupation and habit (humming) but little contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The decision to help finish the cello arrives without visible internal conflict or cost; she shifts from investigator to participant via thematic epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. Claudia's arrival and explanation feel convenient, delivering backstory that flattens Marina's agency in the discovery. The final nod lacks the weight of renunciation or trade-off that would earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clear—dual allegiance and preservation instinct—but her interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The stone chip touching becomes a gestural tic rather than a window into competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her "orderly intuitive" decoding reads smoothly but remains label-only; we don't see the trait constrain or enable a costly choice. The ending choice (incorporate as preservation society) feels efficient rather than wrenching, with minimal visible cost to her mainland ties or community trust.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and voice-particular: "outlasted them all" and her purposeful isolation establish character through specific history. Her choices under pressure—setting up the final vigil, leaving the hourglass—show commitment to documentation over safety, though the emotional progression remains somewhat linear. The contradiction between professional duty and humanity's retreat creates authentic tension, but peak moments occasionally drift toward abstraction ("photographing more than the last wisp") rather than embodied conflict. Internal stakes are clear and motivate the final renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied through sensory perception—her method of reading water and vibration patterns feels character-specific. However, her competence remains unchallenged throughout; she never makes a mistake or faces genuine internal conflict during the repair. The backstory exposition (chemical explosion three years ago) is told efficiently but doesn't complicate her present choices. Chen exists only to ask setup questions and witness Maya's skill, applying no interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margot's interior voice is consistent and specific, filtered through her atlas-editor expertise and dry wit. Her decision at the ending to share the research feels earned by prior beats (the falcon's herald, her mapping work, the condensation discovery). However, her motivations remain somewhat surface-level—we see her obsession but not the contradictory impulses that would deepen it. The inspector arrives conveniently late, functioning more as a plot receiver than a pressure source that forces Margot to weigh competing costs.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bell tuner remains a mystic cipher rather than a character with contradictory impulses; her infinite patience is asserted but never tested by on-page friction. Thomas and the townspeople exist as collective chorus without individual stakes or resistance. The protagonist's decisions (chalk marks, teaching patterns) advance plot but lack visible internal cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path—she simply completes her mission and departs.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior motivation is clear—scientist turned spiritual seeker—but the transformation from researcher to willing sacrifice lacks embodied tension. The choice to "unsnarl from time" arrives without genuine contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her training "screams" but never manifests as a concrete on-page hesitation or micro-choice that costs her something visible. The vial's dwindling supply provides external pressure, yet her final decision feels pre-determined rather than wrestled from competing goods. Interiority leans abstract ("touched something...that made the world above seem suddenly small") rather than character-particular physicalized thought.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation to clear his father's name is established early, but his interior life remains abstract. The hovering trait is mentioned but never creates internal contradiction or meaningful struggle—it's accepted without cost. The discovery of journals and bones provides plot impetus, but Marcus makes no difficult choices; he simply floats to the confessional and speaks. No on-page tension between competing impulses; the character executes a plan without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlow's interiority is grounded in sensory detail (carved stone bead warmth, "mournful elation") and contradictory impulses are present—he greets what is "beloved yet poisonous." However, the final choice feels more orchestrated by the ghost bride's agency than earned by his own internal arc; he stands passive as she enacts the release. The "beautiful, venomous love" framing risks abstraction, yet embodied moments (gasping as memories flood, weeping with salt on his lips) anchor emotion concretely enough to avoid total collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Calla's interior is vivid and specific—her sleepwalking ritual, her transformation from poet to weaver—but her agency feels abstract. The "sewing invisible threads" remains metaphorical throughout; we never see her make a concrete choice that forecloses an option or imposes visible cost. Her optimism is stated ("haunting precisely because it grew from such barren ground") rather than tested by on-page pressure, and the ending delivers affirmation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"dreams had started six months ago—interrupted journeys where she'd board trains that dissolved into mist"—grounding her return in embodied experience. Her agency at the ending (kneeling, clearing soil, discovering the inscription) is earned by prior causality, and the grandmother's inscription provides both external stake and internal pressure. The piece balances her internal contradiction (fled faith twenty years ago vs. feeling "cautious enchantment") without tidy resolution. Minor deduction: the phrase "warmly curious" in "her curiosity warming despite the chill" leans toward label-speak, and the secondary character Yakov applies pressure but his motivation remains sketched rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is established through her ritual and process, but her emotional stakes remain abstract—we see careful invention without visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The mentor's clipboard and her developed system provide texture, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with cost. The ending crystallizes her stance without dramatizing a path foreclosed or a genuine struggle that compels the reader to feel what she risked or renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's disguised competence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—genuine hums alongside encoded intelligence work—with clear interiority ("smiled, genuinely this time"). Her internal texture remains specific through embodied choices: deliberate blood-smear encoding, needle-threading of flame. The final choice feels earned by months of listening and stitching, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Minor slip: Hecht and other officers read slightly stock in their dismissiveness, functional but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The medium's interior motivation—protecting herself rather than Marina—emerges through reflection and is affirmed on-page ("I was protecting myself, not you"), though the confession itself lacks a dramatized micro-choice that visibly alters present tactics. Emotional embodiment is uneven: "scars healed...where unsent letters had carved themselves into her soul" reads as abstraction rather than embodied pain. The final choice to send the message through dreams arrives but the path from armor to vulnerability relies heavily on spirit-mediated revelation rather than internal contradiction acting in scene. No therapy-speak at peak beats, but interiority leans toward poetic summary over moment-by-moment embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority shows concrete particulars—tracing script with morphine-loosened honesty, recognizing the child from the blast—and her final gift of the coral carries weight. However, the "lotus-hearted ache…not quite grief, not quite guilt" reads as label-speak rather than embodied contradiction, and the closing epiphany ("why she'd survived") arrives too cleanly without prior on-page struggle against that question. The child's shrewdly innocent gaze is named but not demonstrated through contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's interior is vivid early ("light-painting," "daydream fold"), but motivation shifts from personal restoration to broadcast joy without clear dramatized pressure. The "knowledge network" floods her with technique; no visible struggle or trade-off grounds the sudden skill. The laugh ("When had she last laughed?") gestures toward change, yet no prior choice foreclosed a path with felt cost—she simply receives and displays, then drifts back. Embodied contradiction is present in the ache for lost happiness, but agency remains passive reception rather than a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elena's interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("methodical nature warred with an inexplicable playfulness") rather than embodied contradiction in action. The coin-flipping choice at the climax feels unearned—no prior causality establishes why *this time* she would "choose differently" or what concrete cost that choice forecloses. Marcus remains a prop with no pressure function, and the "nested awakenings" frame is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal character under stress. The final decision to paint over the mural and "seal away the magic" lacks visible consequence that would make the renunciation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus shows clear motivation (protecting his resistance network) and makes embodied choices under pressure (releasing insects to create scanner interference). Serena's "charming rogue scholar" reads more as assertion than demonstrated contradiction—her confidence is shown but not tested by genuine risk. The final smile feels unearned given the immediate threat; the cost of standing guard remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Internal conflict is present in Marcus's tension but doesn't deepen into competing impulses that force a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The insomniac poet is more contemplative vessel than agent—she proposes, teaches, shows, but rarely makes choices under competing pressures. Interiority consists largely of summary wisdom ("learned across centuries") rather than embodied contradiction. The "shyly unstoppable" attribute is asserted in labels but not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs something. The final renunciation or endurance lacks a visible forfeiture that would elevate character work into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is consistent and her systematic nature embodied through concrete actions (heating orchid stems, whispering the name repeatedly). The thirty-year search provides weight, but the actual choice at climax—capturing the name—feels inevitable rather than conflicted; no competing impulse complicates the moment. Interior life relies on poetic abstraction ("foxglove regret") more than embodied contradiction. The grandmother backstory anchors present stakes but the final choice lacks visible cost since Mira simply completes her life's work without foreclosing an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's motivation to restore diplomatic trust is clear and drives her choices throughout. Her "carefully reckless" approach is stated but not deeply embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—the tension between caution and risk remains mostly tell rather than shown through competing desires in the archive moments. The manuscript work demonstrates competence without meaningful struggle or error that compounds before resolution. Her mentor's warning and her nervous laughter offer brief texture, but internal conflict lacks the friction of genuine blind spots forcing inevitable mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's core motivation—to harmonize the factions—is clear and drives her plan, but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than contradictory or embodied. The "trembling" moment labels recognition without showing conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's wisdom and the surveyor's-chain lineage provide backstory texture, but the final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. Minor: no other characters appear on the page, so relationship dynamics cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margot's arc from disgraced trainer to healing archivist is traced through concrete actions (burning clippings, creating emotion-based inventory) and embodied in her meditation on dust motes. The transformation feels overly tidy—"brittle as autumn leaves" sliding through seasonal metaphors into "bloom back into herself"—and the final epiphany arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or cost. Theodore's reveal functions as external validation rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. Interior voice remains consistent but leans toward elevated reflection that occasionally distances us from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's motivation is clear and her journey shows determination, but her interiority relies heavily on interpretive leaps ("intuited what others had missed") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The father exists only as backstory and symbolic absence; no secondary character applies pressure. The final "choice" to build bridges feels declared rather than earned through visible cost—she simply begins drawing codes without foreclosing a dramatized path.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's professional expertise and waiting methodology are established, but her interiority remains thinly rendered—mostly assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "understanding finally that some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through summary rather than a choice under pressure. Chen provides minimal secondary pressure; he exists primarily as an exposition receiver. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost; Mira arrives at belonging without foreclosing a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recollectionist's emotional texture is consistent—"cheerfully gloomy"—and embodied through concrete actions (humming, kneeling, singing). However, her interior remains observational rather than pressured by contradictory impulses; she narrates discoveries without facing a credible dilemma that forces a costly choice. The final reflection on paths changing form reads as insight without visible on-page renunciation or alteration of her collecting practice. Motivation is present but not tested under sufficient friction to earn a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus displays clear observational habits and tactical thinking (mapping acoustics, timing groups), but his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The teenager interaction offers a micro-choice (shifting repertoire, accepting the guitar pick), yet the cost is abstract; we don't see what Marcus forfeits by engaging this way versus another. Embodied emotion is present but limited: "smiled, incorporated a strumming motion" reads more performed than felt. The piece defaults to competence without genuine struggle or blind spots that compound pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to create defiance-art is clear, but her interior life remains abstract—"obsidian grace," "cosmic verse"—without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The dance sequence tells us she transforms but does not dramatize a conflicting desire or miscalculation that forces a trade-off. The ending renunciation (knowing capture will come) reads as pre-determined rather than earned through on-page friction. No visible cost beyond acceptance of an inevitable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in his glazier's craft—"reading between lines" manifests through stress fractures and interference patterns. His decision to document and teach before demolition shows agency with visible cost (professional identity ending). Internal contradiction is present: he's spent thirty years framing views without truly seeing through them, and this reckoning drives his final stance. Minor deduction for the epiphany feeling slightly over-articulated in places ("surfaces weren't barriers but birthplaces of possibility"), but the embodied observations through glass, water, and light ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interior life is consistently rendered through embodied detail—the box "weighed nothing...yet held everything," his hands "gently skilled at coaxing frightened hikers" yet trembling before fragile grief. The core choice to share his scars with his crew is motivated by accumulated pressure, though the video-recording device arrives conveniently without prior setup. Internal contradiction appears in the moment he opens the box despite earlier resistance, but the shift reads as earned by the celestial convergence and six months of carrying. One micro-penalty: "hard softness" and "violent tenderness" veer toward label-speak in key beats without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marina's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("methodical observation," "logical mind," "patient determination") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandmother relationship exists primarily as exposition; no genuine internal conflict surfaces—Marina moves smoothly from discovery to understanding without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "smile" and acceptance feel unmotivated by prior struggle; no foreclosed path with visible cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her perceptual ability is embodied in concrete action (pressing palms, catching fragments). However, interiority leans toward explanation rather than contradiction under pressure—her reverence for walls and legacy remains stable without genuine internal conflict testing it. The final choice to add her own whisper feels inevitable rather than foreclosing a live path with visible cost. Minor issue: "Legacy's burden" reads as a diagnostic label rather than dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation is clearly rooted in her daughter's coma and expressed through concrete painting actions. The borrowed heartbeat metaphor drives her persistence, though the piece leans heavily on summary ("Three months ago...") rather than dramatizing micro-choices under immediate pressure. Interiority is often poetic but somewhat abstract ("perceptively calm despite the urgency"); embodied contradiction appears more in description than in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment—setting down the brush as the sparrow sings—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost, though the cost itself (waiting, hoping) is more felt than concretely foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara's arc from violence to "operatively gentle" is grounded in embodied grief (brother's death, her retaliatory killings) and drives her breach of ritual protocol. Her stance crystallization—"we're not the heroes"—emerges from prior causality and forecloses the old narratives with visible cost. The Theren and Kolani delegates remain somewhat generic beyond their physical descriptions, and the younger Kolani delegate's kneeling feels slightly convenient, but Mara's contradictory impulses (fury reformed into patience) act simultaneously in scene. Minor therapy-speak ("redemption," "violence reformed") in peak beats and the delegates' quick pivot strain believability slightly, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her internal contradiction—destroying to preserve—operates consistently throughout. The amoral philanthropist trait functions on the page through calculated actions (buying out indigenous people, manufacturing drought). However, the interiority leans heavily toward articulate self-awareness ("she was their sole, terrible translator") that edges into diagnostic precision uncommon mid-crisis. The final choice to bury the egg is dramatized with visible cost (the crack she engineered), but earlier beats summarize destruction rather than showing micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyralei's motivation to free the echoes is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("body a living poem," "living anthology of resistance") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece tells us she is untouched and trained in seduction yet never dramatizes an on-page moment where those contradictory impulses collide in a micro-choice. The final transformation is declared ("no longer tamed") without visible cost that forecloses a path; we see no sacrifice, no relationship severed, no ability lost—only enhancement.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's "uncommonly serene" stance is declared but rarely embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His decision to prepare tomorrow's performance feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle; we're told he's wrestling with ethical storytelling, but no micro-choice reveals competing values with visible cost. The reflection dominates (well over 30% of text) without interleaving enough present-tense decisions that alter his options, and the final preparation montage summarizes intent rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to honor the cloud dwellers is clear and drives her action, but her internal life remains largely cerebral and observational. The piece offers embodied moments ("weathered fingers," "blushing stillness") yet the protagonist's choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted—she never hesitates or confronts a competing impulse. The final act of watching the butterfly depart carries cost (impermanence, solitude) but the cost is atmospheric rather than a dramatized forfeiture that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elsa's motivation is clear and her professional expertise shapes her approach to the rope, but her internal contradiction remains static. The grandmother-fire guilt is told rather than shown pressing against present choices. The forgiveness arc is complete before the story begins, removing dramatic tension. Micro-choices like "technically gentle movements" feel more like craft description than character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's motivation to understand her foresight is clear and her "precisely playful" nature is embodied in gesture and tone. Internal contradiction appears when she moves through predetermined beats while claiming confusion, but this tension serves the premise. The choice to remove the crown and ascend reads as acceptance rather than a decisive turn that forecloses options with visible cost—she simply walks the path she already saw. Embodied emotion is present but the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("choice itself was an illusion wrapped inside a memory disguised as prophecy") that feels authored rather than character-particular under crisis pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's devotion is established through years of work and frugal living, but her interiority remains abstract—she "understood," "recognized," "felt knowledge uncloak"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The climactic moment when she speaks numbers aloud and seals contact lacks visible internal conflict; her trajectory is linear devotion without competing impulses. The final smile declares satisfaction rather than showing a cost that forecloses another path. Backstory occupies substantial space but doesn't anchor in present friction that alters her stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marcus's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—his "scheming mind already three moves ahead" reads as label rather than embodied tension. The Magistrate's arc from rage to weeping occurs via transmitted cellular memory rather than on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Vera exists as a convenience mechanism with no interior contradiction or cost to her fragmentary existence. The closure choice (releasing the grip) is told through metaphysical exposition rather than earned through prior causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority shows craft-based confidence and her decision to help demonstrates consistent character logic, but the astronomer remains functionally thin—his desperation is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The breathing synchronization and mirror selection are goal-driven micro-choices that reveal Elara's values, yet the astronomer's final acceptance arrives without visible internal friction or cost. The grandmother's wisdom about mirrors functions as exposition rather than a constraint that Elara must navigate under pressure. No therapy-speak or label-only emotions appear; embodiment is present but not charged with contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—her trembling from memory, the lie about the wrong bag that she immediately recognizes as pattern. The contradiction between her vow and her deeper knowledge drives the choice to climb and teach. Mira is less developed; her fistiness is asserted more than enacted in pressured micro-choices. The final bridge moment feels slightly neat given the brevity of their reconnection, but the cost of isolation versus transmission is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The curator's bewilderment is embodied through concrete actions (floating, clutching, biting the apple) and her retreat to the bathroom shows character-specific coping. However, interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("inheritance wasn't linear because knowledge itself wasn't linear") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to accept the temporal loop feels declared more than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("temporal vertigo," "vulnerability met necessity") that abstracts rather than grounds emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear (find the library) and her expertise in dead languages creates her solution, but interiority remains thin—we never feel contradictory impulses or embodied cost during her choices. The amber-trapped seekers and time traveler function as props rather than relational pressure. Her offer to "complete the diary" arrives smoothly but without prior struggle or visible trade-off that would earn the transformation; the mountain simply accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("cellular memories her body carried"), but her arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The peak choice—pocketing the card rather than pinning it—arrives without visible internal friction or a hierarchy of competing values under pressure. Coraline remains atmospheric but underutilized as a pressure source; her function is more expository mirror than crucible. The final renunciation feels thematically motivated but not causally earned by prior on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's "adaptable archivist" trait is demonstrated through purposeful action (sorting, reconfiguring rope, translating confusion), though her choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted. Interior access is consistent but lacks genuine struggle—the protagonist moves through complex puzzles with near-seamless competence, missing the internal contradiction that would elevate pressure. The final step through the flickering door carries conceptual weight but not visceral cost; we see intellectual resolution more than renunciation or transformation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mapkeeper's interiority is concrete and specific (reading patterns in ice, tracing cracks with tactile precision), and her motivation is consistent throughout. The extraction ritual demonstrates competence balanced with genuine challenge. However, the emotional progression lacks embodied contradiction—her stance remains steady rather than showing simultaneous conflicting impulses. The energy beings' transformation feels observed rather than earned through her internal struggle, limiting the felt cost of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her retrocognitive trait is established, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract metaphysical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to rekindle the beacon follows logically from her visions, yet the decision lacks genuine internal conflict—she never wavers or pays a visible psychological cost. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("understanding finally what her visions had been trying to tell her") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("preemptively nostalgic for this moment," "consciousness of loss...was what made them human") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her key realization—that cherishing memories as they form defines humanity—arrives as an epiphany without prior on-page struggle or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The archivist role is told through exposition (scholarly training, chosen for "ability to feel the weight of the present moment") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority operates at a conceptual register that distances the reader from felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaia's motivation is clear and her fireworks expertise grounds her choices, but her internal life remains surface-level—she filters the world through her chant without genuine contradiction or self-doubt. The elderly mosaic artist functions as convenient support rather than applying pressure. The children's "listless game" and "forced and brittle" laughter are told rather than shown through specific behavior. Kaia's transformation from solitary wanderer to community leader occurs too smoothly without visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's observational stance and Chen's withdrawal are character-specific and embodied through gesture (jade cicada handling, pool watching). The transformation motif (spider crab example, hermit crab) creates internal coherence, though Mira's warmth sometimes edges toward therapeutic insight ("Fear would mean believing these transitions are endings") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The ending choice—Chen's return—is foreclosed by pool observation rather than a visible cost paid by Mira on the page. The piece maintains strong interiority but lacks a decisive trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior world is vividly rendered through embodied sensation—"peculiar lightness," "stomach-dropping suddenness"—and her choice to remain at the observation deck rather than retreat demonstrates agency. The porcelain doll warming in her grip and her sensory catalogue of silence flavors (pre-dawn stillness, pause between heartbeats) provide concrete, character-particular detail. However, the father's bunker-building backstory functions primarily as thematic setup rather than generating present contradiction; Mira's arc from claustrophobia to expansion feels more declarative than earned through on-page struggle. The final vial-gift gesture toward her father lands as sentiment rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus shows practiced competence and earned knowledge through twelve years of work, with clear interiority around his role as transformer rather than transporter. The passenger remains thin—her distress is labeled ("breathing came too quick") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses, and her shift feels guided by Marcus's wisdom rather than her own agency. The backstory about Marcus being "once a passenger too" arrives as explanation rather than constraint on present choice. Internal conflict is present but muted; Marcus operates smoothly without meaningful friction between his wants and the situation's demands.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    Anya's motivation is declared ("find the stairway") but her interior life remains thin—discovering the throne's purpose lands as epiphany delivered through mural text rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The line "understanding flooding through her" exemplifies tell-heavy revelation. Embodied emotion is sparse; no micro-choices under pressure constrain her path with visible cost. The ending reconfigures her goal (sharing knowledge vs. claiming power), but the shift reads conceptual rather than felt, and no prior on-page struggle between hoarding and sharing dramatizes the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shadow keeper's motivations are established (drowning in others' needs, burning bridges for her calling), but her actions remain observational throughout. The piece tells us she "severed the last thread" and "burned those bridges with surgical precision," yet we never see a micro-choice under present pressure that tests these traits. The shadows' transformation is shown, but the keeper's own internal contradiction—her careful devastation versus her tenderness—never crystallizes into a dramatized decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's interior voice carries distinct texture ("bitter and bright," the submarine bolt grounding ritual), and the pyramid-scheme backstory provides motivation. However, the final transformation feels unearned—her shift from victim to enlightened converter happens through mystical revelation rather than embodied struggle. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is label-only, never constraining a choice. Emotional progression relies on therapy-speak epiphanies ("transmute failure into wisdom") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Victoria's motivation is clear and her final choice to throw the crank handle and donate the estate demonstrates agency with cost. The interiority leans toward abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure—"eloquently silent" functions more as concept than lived constraint that forces micro-choices in scene. The family curse is told rather than dramatized through specific behavioral tradeoffs, and the moment of decision feels conceptually clean rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    Aldric's interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic language ("quantum simultaneously," "every potential sensation at once") that never lands in embodied contradiction. The transformation at closure is asserted through elevated metaphor rather than earned through prior choices that reveal competing impulses. No micro-choice under pressure demonstrates a hierarchy of values; the knight simply accepts the puppet's hand without visible cost or foreclosed path. The seven years of silence and the final surrender feel like set-pieces rather than decisions driven by contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with his excavation of files driven by personal wounds and the need to witness grace. His micro-choices—photographing the note, building his private index, leaving breadcrumbs in his own file—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost (the relationship with Sarah). Internal contradiction operates subtly: he searches for his mother's file while simultaneously finding solace in others' stories, suggesting both avoidance and preparation. The ending choice to continue searching rather than finding feels earned by the accumulative pressure of small kindnesses, though the final stance leans slightly toward summary rather than a fresh micro-choice that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivations are clear (recover suppressed history, prove herself after being underestimated), but her interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The key moment—deciding to emerge from the tunnels with evidence—lacks visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she simply executes a plan. Jakob exists primarily to deliver exposition and validate her choices rather than apply genuine relational pressure. The final stance feels announced ("anger without knowledge is just noise") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus shows clear motivation to contain the prophecy and his micro-choices (dancing fingers without touching keys) demonstrate agency under pressure. However, interiority remains thin—his emotions are told through abstractions like "eerie nostalgia" rather than embodied contradiction. The gathering musicians lack distinct voices or individual stakes, functioning as ambient chorus rather than pressure points. The final renunciation carries weight but feels more conceptual than viscerally earned through prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's transformation is dramatized through concrete actions (sorting seeds, building cairns, prodding the speck), but her internal process remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The arrival at "mossy delight" and "understanding" reads as asserted epiphany without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting in scene. The grandmother's legacy provides backstory motivation, but the protagonist's choices feel predetermined by the magical object rather than emerging from internal conflict. No visible cost accompanies her awakening—she gains abilities and purpose without foreclosing anything.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's shift from attempting traditional repair to accepting broken things is dramatized through concrete actions (suspending the compass, moving to the greenhouse), but the interior journey lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance—"I help them find what they were meant to be broken"—feels declared rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a prior path. The character reads as contemplative rather than pressured, with choices flowing smoothly toward insight without genuine struggle or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's alchemical transformation and facial scars provide embodied history, and her choice to guide Mira carries weight. However, Mira's internal arc feels underdeveloped—she moves from clutching the coin in despair to smiling insight without sufficient on-page struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The seventeen/fourteen age discrepancy (text says "like you are now" but earlier states Mira is seventeen) creates confusion. Vera's motivation to help is clear, but Mira's shift to understanding reads more as received wisdom than earned transformation through visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara shows agency through her choice to pursue Thomas and her improvised humming strategy, though motivation remains largely role-bound rather than internally conflicted. Thomas's arc from perfectionist shame to acceptance is earned through specific confession beats, and the ghostly musician's embodied struggle with phantom strings provides concrete particularity. However, interiority leans toward explanatory rather than contradictory impulses—"afraid that imperfection meant worthlessness" tells rather than dramatizes the knot—and Mara's competence faces little genuine friction or blind spots that complicate her role.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's enhanced proprioception creates vivid embodied interiority ("exact angle of her spine," "seventeen facial muscles"), and her micro-choices—touching the strap, removing it with inverted motion, approaching the child at calculated distance—reveal values under pressure. The final turn toward teaching feels earned by her recorded "mathematics of pain" and the proprioceptive precision that previously trapped her. However, the therapeutic arc ("mathematics of mercy") leans toward diagnostic self-awareness at peak beats, and the child encounter, while purposeful, arrives late without prior setup, reducing felt cost in the renunciation of the strap.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's gift is established but remains largely abstract—"read the spaces between languages" and "elusively tangible sense" function as labels rather than embodied constraints that force choices. The grandmother backstory anchors motivation, but the present-tense action (scraping paint, discovering coordinates) lacks internal conflict or competing impulses; Mira moves through discovery without visible cost or hesitation. The acceptance of the knife and the decision to project stories are frictionless, reducing agency to observation rather than renunciation or endurance. Competence is high but struggle is minimal, weakening the felt price of her final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("cables singing," dust-pattern reading), and his ghost-sight ability constrains his choices throughout. The grandmother flashback at the funeral is well-anchored and shifts his present action. However, the cluster of ghosts materializing near the end—maintenance man, building manager, actress—arrive without prior embodiment or distinct pressure, reading as convenience casting. The final choice to take evidence to reporters feels stated rather than wrestled with under contradictory impulses; we see decision but not the competing costs that would earn the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    Moth's interiority is rendered largely through abstract metaphysical concepts ("rustling awakenings," "every possible version of herself") rather than embodied emotion or concrete contradictory impulses. The decision to uncork the bottle and print eternity lacks dramatized internal conflict; we're told she "knew she should file it properly" but no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of competing desires. The final self-scattering reads as a metaphysical gesture rather than a choice with felt human cost. The character functions as a cipher for the story's concept rather than a person under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cassia's revolutionary past anchors her motivation and shapes her reading of the Venusian ruins, but the internal contradiction between defeat and new purpose is told more than dramatized in pivotal beats. The shard-handling moment where she sees ghosts is embodied and specific, yet her emotional progression from prison poet to archaeological advocate relies heavily on reflection rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure. Huang remains functional but one-note; his nervous glove adjustment and curiosity shift serve the plot without applying genuine counter-pressure. The final turn—"we'll give them a resurrection"—arrives as declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a visible option with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elias exhibits clear motivation and makes the pivotal choice to tether the chip to all boxes rather than just one, showing agency under pressure. His interior experience—"understanding flooding through him"—feels functional but edges toward convenient epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction or struggle. The wilting sensation provides embodied stakes, and Vex's decay offers external consequence, though Elias's competence never truly wavers or costs him a visible mistake that compounds before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and intensifies through the descent, with the psychometric vision providing embodied discovery. However, her decision to retreat rather than follow feels under-motivated given the buildup—"sensibly eccentric, not foolishly brave" reads as authorial convenience rather than earned character logic. Internal contradiction is present (collector vs. pilgrim) but the final choice doesn't sufficiently dramatize the cost of delay. The compass vision provides strong interiority, but the ending renunciation lacks visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's choices shape the narrative—sheltering under the archway, carving the driftwood—but her interior life leans heavily on abstract epiphany ("understanding finally why the GPS had failed") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The magic lantern slide provides external motivation, yet her emotional progression reads more like accumulated wisdom than lived friction; we see reverence and flow, but little genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a path. Grandmother's memory and the timewoven artists are evocative but remain decorative guides rather than forces that complicate her choices with visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's quiet devotion is legible and her final choice to hide the postcards feels motivated, but her interior work remains largely contemplative rather than conflict-driven. The piece tells us she "understood" repeatedly without dramatizing the struggle that earns understanding through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("fingertips still stained"); most interiority operates at a remove, summarizing rather than enacting the cost of her obsession. The ending forecloses a path (leaving the postcards) with visible cost, but the decision emerges from reflection more than from a dramatized crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amara's motive to decode and understand the diary is clear, but her actions feel passive—she's "trapped," visited by Marcus, and follows his instructions. The retrocognitive state offers an interesting constraint, yet her interior life remains abstract ("temporal vertigo," "searing weight") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending realization about courage is told rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a visible path.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas's motivation to restore through memory-essence rather than shatter the bottle shows clear agency, and his alchemical training grounds the transformation work. The internal contradiction between hermit exile and community restoration creates tension. However, the core choice—using the bottle to seed potential rather than release it—feels more conceptual than viscerally conflicted; the cost of this method (hours standing, personal drain) is stated but not embodied through degraded perception or physical consequence that alters his stance. The final smile undercuts the weight of what he's undertaken.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Matthias's core motivation (archiving emotional patterns) is established early and drives the transcription work at closure. The third-grade memory provides concrete embodied detail ("pressing his small hands against the display case") and his童年 insight about patterns is character-specific. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—he listens, discovers, understands, transcribes—without facing a meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final act of placing the shaving in a glass case and speaking to trees feels more like fulfillment than renunciation or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to reopen her grandmother's legacy is clear, but her interior remains abstract—"furiously tranquil precision" and "wild serenity" function as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The acorn-cap handling and seed-sorting provide tactile grounding, yet no genuine struggle or competing impulse emerges; she executes her birthright without visible friction or cost to her stance. The piece tells us she's spent three hundred winters preparing, but on the page she moves through the sequence without a single micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values or forecloses a path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("felt it in her bones," physical grip on the rope), and her choice to ring the bell shows contradictory impulses—trusting old wisdom over modern certainty under pressure. However, her competence is too smooth; the "credibly curious" trait appears only as a label ("credibly curious about the pressure readings") without constraining a choice or revealing a blind spot that complicates her path. The grandmother backstory anchors her listening preference but remains inert; it doesn't tilt a present micro-choice until the bell-ringing decision, which feels more like validation than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kepler-9's interior landscape is richly developed through embodied perception (tracing trajectories as pilgrims, synthetic fingers trembling), and the progression from isolation-as-weakness to vulnerability-as-strength is earned through concrete observation. However, the epiphany arrives through contemplation of an external object rather than a micro-choice under pressure; the janitor's agency is primarily receptive rather than decisively active. The transformation reads as philosophical realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Emotional progression is credible but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's characterization shows purposeful restraint—her seventeen years of solitary survival and her careful observation align with her final choice to remain as keeper. However, her motivation shifts from survival to preservation feel more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandfather's "tranquil perception" and "mute eloquence" are told attributes rather than dramatized through competing desires. The final stance of tending silence reads as thematic position rather than a choice with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual labels ("texture of time passing," "borrowed-time timekeeper") rather than embodied emotion and concrete micro-choices under pressure. The entire middle passage operates as a reflective info-dump about Voss's design without dramatized internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "choice" to gather fragments and teach others feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path appears; he simply accepts a mission that costs him nothing we can see.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is legible—her seven-year practice of tending to broken things—but her interior remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The boy is properly secondary, his loss clear, yet Mira's decisive teaching moment lacks visible cost; she offers wisdom without forfeiting a competing desire or enduring friction. Embodied emotion is present (kneeling, catching the feather) but the final stance feels arrived-at rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No orientation or filter issues; interiority is concrete and voice-consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to bridge species and accept her terminal diagnosis is clearly rooted, and the tumor-as-electromagnetic-signature device is introduced early. However, her interior landscape lacks genuine contradiction—she moves through revelation and acceptance with remarkably smooth philosophical clarity ("brazen calm" becomes a shield against dramatized fear or doubt). The emotional progression feels more like enlightened acceptance than the messy, irrational layering expected under terminal pressure. Micro-choices exist (wire placement, diary documentation) but they illustrate a thesis rather than reveal competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's "luminous skepticism" and academic rebellion are stated but not deeply embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her arc from skepticism to understanding reads cleanly but lacks the visceral cost of renunciation—the final acceptance ("her rebellion had been scripted from the start") feels more like intellectual resignation than a choice that forecloses a live path. Marcus remains a functional foil without pressure of his own. The piece would benefit from Elena making a concrete micro-choice under competing desires rather than arriving at philosophical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coachman remains observational rather than decisively choosing under pressure; his work is presented as already understood ritual rather than discovery with cost. Internal contradiction is absent—he moves through his task with settled purpose and no competing impulses. The final paragraph's "his work here was done" and "the promise that from its bones would rise something beautiful enough to make forgetting a mercy" edges toward therapeutic epiphany language without embodied struggle. Backstory dominates via exposition about plague seasons, grandmother's songs, and months of observation, but these reflections do not pivot a present micro-choice that alters his approach on this night.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sage's motivation is clear—finding the lost child—and her sensory degradation ("no longer trusted her nose") creates character-specific constraint. The bloodhound courier ancestry provides backstory that tilts present choice, anchoring the magnetic-field intuition without forced epiphany. However, the emotional progression from seventeen years of corpse-tracking to hopeful summoning feels compressed; the shift from retirement to renewed purpose lands cleanly but the intermediate grief and loss remain told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interior life is rendered through concrete particulars—her hand on the compass, her sketching with purpose—but her emotional journey toward becoming "home for others" arrives too cleanly without contradictory impulses in scene. The temporal stretching as curse-turned-compass is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Her grandmother's voice and the family custom anchor motivation, yet the transition from isolation to lighthouse feels more declared than earned through on-page struggle. Minor: "blessed pariah" functions as a label rather than an embodied state with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Renn's motivation is clear and her master's teaching provides character-specific texture, but the Keeper remains underdeveloped—a philosophical foil without embodied reaction or internal contradiction. The final choice to "amend" rather than preserve feels thematically declared more than earned through visible struggle; Renn's interiority leans toward articulate insight ("wonder isn't meant to be preserved—it's meant to be released") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The transformation reads as smooth execution of her master's lesson rather than a renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina's motivation is established early and her choices (tracing words, refusing to testify) emerge from consistent interiority. The contradiction between survivor and "crisis actor" label creates credible psychological pressure. However, the internal experience leans heavily on poetic reflection rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The decision to stay and document rather than witness officially feels earned but the micro-choices lack visible friction—her walking-writing proceeds without dramatized hesitation or cost beyond the stated refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The seer's internal arc—from mercury visions to soil gardening—shows contradictory impulses (prophecy consuming her past vs. desire to recover lost talents) that drive the plot. However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract; the choice to plant is less a difficult decision under pressure than a lyric realization. Embodied emotion appears in "the particular ache of kneeling" and "the smell of rain," but peak moments lean toward poetic assertion rather than struggle. The final stance crystallization is earned by the stone's guidance, though the cost (abandoning prophecy) is implied rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaspar's guilt over teaching the wrong defense is anchored concretely, and his forgiveness arc culminates in a visible choice (placing the copper piece, walking away). However, the central journey relies heavily on abstraction—"winnowing truth from possibility" and "fierce repose"—rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The student's face appearing in the platinum queen is asserted insight rather than earned through on-page friction, and the final renunciation ("carrying the guilt served neither his student nor his future pupils") edges toward therapeutic self-awareness that flattens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's motivation is clear and her actions consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—"courage to speak complexity" reads as concept rather than embodied contradiction. The gesture of teaching others to see differently is told rather than dramatized through specific on-page choices that reveal competing impulses. Emotional stakes are declared (condemned artist, defiant) but never textured with the bodily weight of fear or cost during the climb itself. The final smile feels unearned without visible hesitation or tradeoff that would anchor her triumph in genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's core motivation (preserve meaning at the edge of oblivion) drives the narration action coherently, but her agency reads as execution of a pre-set ritual rather than discovery under pressure. The "uncertain alchemist" label is told, not embodied—she never hesitates, recalibrates, or faces a meaningful internal conflict during the key beats. Embodied emotion is present ("hands trembled," "smiled") but leans toward performed gestures rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The choice to proceed feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interior life is richly embodied through her painting ritual and mechanical movements, and the grandmother's cave discovery creates a meaningful reframing of her isolation. The final choice to continue both lives shows earned understanding. However, the epiphany arrives through convenient discovery rather than Marina's own contradictory impulses acting in scene—she absorbs wisdom passively. The "intimately aloof" attribute remains more told than demonstrated through on-page micro-choices with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to bring Thomas back is established, but her agency operates primarily through ritualized actions (releasing scent, climbing stairs, speaking forgiveness) rather than choices under pressure that reveal internal contradiction. The "purified intentions" arc is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Thomas's guilt-prison and her three-year vigil provide setup, but the moment of forgiveness feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final reunion lacks felt cost—no path is foreclosed, no renunciation made.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina's interior is well-embodied through physical trembling and concrete choices under pressure. Her moon-phase limitation creates genuine constraint ("could hardly lift the heavy bronze artifact") that shapes tactics. The brother's call crystallizes her renunciation—"some of us are meant to stay"—but the decision feels more declared than tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Her competence (precise navigation instructions) lacks visible struggle or blind spots that compound before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's compulsion to confess everything is embodied through concrete, painful examples ("I told my daughter her artwork was mediocre"). Her motivation to escape this curse drives credible choices—smuggling the eye, foraging dangerous truffles, risking an untested cure. The final turn where she chooses discretion over dishonesty feels earned by her suffering. Minor slip: the ending pivot to "rebuild...a world that could honor both honesty and mercy" edges toward abstract mission statement rather than lived cost, though the glass eye clicking like dice grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Magnus's gift of memory-reading is established early and his investigation unfolds through concrete choices (timing the gaps, scratching coordinates). The backstory of Elizabeth and their son arrives late but reweights his isolation with visible cost—he chooses to continue his solitary watch with recovered joy rather than pursue reunion. The son's motivation (inherited gift, investigating omissions) reads plausible, though his final dive feels more symbolic than causally grounded. Internal contradiction is present: Magnus both craves connection and accepts isolation, embodied in his decision to pin the boutonniere and return to the lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's empirically intuitive gift is established early and his internal conflict between knowing and never journeying is clear, but the character's emotional progression feels too smooth—no genuine struggle against closing the shop after thirty years of routine. The grandfather's deathbed promise and Marcus's seven-year-old self are told rather than shown shaping present choices. The final transformation from "someone who only sold maps" to "someone who followed them" arrives as assertion rather than embodied cost; we don't see what he forfeits by stepping through.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraphina's motivation is clear and her progression toward transformation is dramatized through action. However, the interiority relies heavily on poetic description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her anger and disenchantment are told more than they complicate her choices in scene. The decision to transform feels inevitable from the setup rather than earned through wrestling with competing desires. The embodied emotion is present but often filtered through metaphor ("her flesh growing translucent") instead of visceral particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's motivation to bottle presence is embodied through her tactile engagement with the nexus and shell, and her final insight about presence needing witness shows earned growth. However, the interiority leans heavily into abstract metaphysical language ("density of presence," "gravity of connection") that distances emotional particularity. The grandmother backstory provides motivation but operates as exposition rather than pressure-testing Lyra's flaws. Marcus functions more as philosophical interlocutor than a character with his own contradictory wants.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and character-particular in moments like "laughed, a sound like bark peeling from ancient trees," and her contradictory impulses—envy of her past self's certainty versus knowledge of inevitable chaos—act simultaneously. The choice to step outside and "begin by falling" feels motivated by accumulated pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Multiple iterations of Maya blur into a collective rather than individuated choices, which softens agency. The final renunciation (accepting she's "already soaring") earns its moment but lacks the sharp tradeoff that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior landscape is concrete and character-particular—her lost smell reshaping how she perceives repair work through touch and sound. The metaphorical leap "reading between lines" functions as her perceptual signature, but her agency remains observational through most beats; she translates Mrs. Huang's grief without facing a competing pressure that would force her own trade-off. The final choice to leave the screw "deliberately loose—functional yet free to remember" offers embodied decision-making, yet the cost remains symbolic rather than viscerally felt. Mrs. Huang's grief is handled with care, but her presence never forces Mara into contradiction or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interior is vivid—crystalline stress reactions are embodied and specific—but her final epiphany arrives through held-breath meditation rather than genuine struggle against competing impulses. The grandmother memory supplies motivation retroactively instead of creating live contradiction in the peak beat. Master Yuen remains a witness rather than applying relational pressure. The transformation feels more granted by memory than earned through on-page conflict between Kira's scholarly dismissal and her body's truth.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's interiority is concrete and particularized throughout, with clear embodied choices under pressure. Her motivation to apologize is dramatized through the perfume bottle scene and collaboration, showing growth from her prior brutal exorcism approach. Marcus's dual voice with Elisabetta is handled cleanly, though the grandmother's personality beyond "gentle composer" remains thin. The final choice to help complete the requiem is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Vera's acknowledgment of past damage.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaia's motivation to witness and arbitrate remains abstract; we see her walking and understanding but never struggling with a choice that costs her something concrete. The internal contradiction promised by "spiral arbitration" never manifests as embodied conflict—she moves through realizations without resistance or error. The final smile and recursive forgetting feel like asserted wisdom rather than earned transformation. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shepherd's interiority is highly reflective and abstract, dwelling on philosophical questions about time and clocks. Her grandmother's deathbed wisdom ("Clocks don't measure time, they measure distance") provides backstory motivation, but the protagonist makes no on-page choice under pressure—she performs her ritual counting, records data, and continues as before. The piece offers embodied details (brass key warmth, water gurgling) but the emotional register remains contemplative throughout with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she ends with "her purpose as clear as the horizon line she guarded," suggesting stasis without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's internal contradiction between teaching probability and disbelieving it is established but remains abstract; her father's compulsion is told rather than shown in the present. The final "understanding" that dice and equations are "different languages for the same impossible hope" arrives as assertion rather than through embodied choice. No on-page micro-choice forces Elena to trade one value for another with visible cost. The stranger's appearance provides exposition about Elena's state rather than pressuring a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is given a consistent interior logic—his eleven-year commitment and his cultivation of "wrong number friendships"—but his choices feel more observational than pressured. The interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("melodically haunted quality") rather than embodied contradiction. Eleanor's moment of self-awareness ("Sometimes I think I made her up entirely") gestures toward earned insight, but Marcus never faces a genuine dilemma that tests his method or forces a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's interior world is vivid and contradictory—her archival pride battles ethical revulsion in the three-day deliberation period, and the codicil solution embodies both impulses simultaneously. Eleanor remains thinly sketched, existing primarily to deliver exposition and enable Mara's choice. The final exchange ("Thank you" / nod / locket transfer) gestures toward emotional complexity but rushes past the weight it claims, and the "haunted euphoria" label appears more asserted than embodied through contradictory physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sadie's character is strongly realized through specific, embodied voice ("desperately jocular edge she'd perfected in Mozambique") and contradictory impulses (the manipulator who genuinely wants to connect people). Marcus is functional but thinner—his loneliness is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final insight about "purpose tangled up with other people's purposes" feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional honesty, though the prior causality earns the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara's interiority remains abstract throughout—"she understood now why she'd been born blind" arrives as unearned epiphany rather than dramatized cost. Her choices (touching trees, following melody) never face contradiction or force a visible trade-off; the journey reads as guided tour rather than pressure-driven decision. Emotional progression is summary-only ("changed," "profound"), not embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The lack of micro-choices with felt consequences at closure prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is specific and her guilt over the colonial fleet drives the stakes, but internal conflict reads more as sequential reasoning than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The choice to broadcast both coordinates feels cerebral and explained rather than embodied under pressure—"With confident uncertainty, she transmitted both" delivers the attribute but lacks visceral cost in the moment. The grandfather's pen anchors memory effectively, yet her decision path remains tidy and rational where ambiguity should fracture her stance. Backstory about the mistake is efficient and tilts the present, meeting BRR guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's motivation to translate silence is consistent and her choice to finally accept the new form of music at closure shows earned shift. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract statements ("the familiar ache of beauty without sound") rather than embodied contradiction. The "forty years" backstory block exceeds BRR allowance without anchoring to micro-choices that alter present tactics. Chen remains underdeveloped—her "quietly charismatic" presence is asserted but never dramatized through on-page pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The analytically intuitive trait remains label-only; we never see her detect patterns in scene under pressure with visible cost. Her past as an arsonist and her ancestral connection are summarized retrospectively without embodied choices that test commitment. The final "volcanic tenderness" момент lacks genuine internal conflict—she simply memorizes, with no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interior motivation is clear—she encodes rebellion through drumming—but the translation of physical drumming into system subversion lacks concrete mechanics that would ground her agency. The final dissolution into collective consciousness ("thirty-seven became one became infinite") reads as mystical summary rather than embodied cost; we don't witness her struggle to "hold firm to her perch" with contradictory physical or mental stakes. Dr. Chen remains functional background, and the "wisps" of other patients supply atmosphere without pressuring Mira's choices. The drumming habit is told as purposeful but not dramatized as a micro-choice under competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's maintenance expertise and gait-recognition ability motivate his navigation choices, and the board's forced listening embodies an earned shift. However, the coin-as-grandfather's-artifact and his twelve-year accumulation of knowledge read as backstory exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending choice—gifting the coin—feels more symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a lived path with visible cost; Chen's acceptance is told ("finally understanding") rather than shown through embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is defined entirely by external action and mystical wisdom-keeper labels ("spiralingly calm," "guardian of the truth") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Thomas receives more interiority—shoulders hunched, tears streaming—but his transformation from frozen grief to dissolving burden arrives through observation rather than micro-choices that constrain him. The piece tells us Mira "understood" and shows Thomas "began to understand" without dramatizing the internal friction that would make either credible. No visible cost forecloses a path; the boy simply walks away lighter.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus shows clear motivation and his gift of hearing unspoken words provides interiority, but the piece relies heavily on label-speak ("amplified quiet," "forests of second thoughts") rather than embodied contradiction. Elena's emotional arc from sobbing to confident final move compresses too quickly without intermediate micro-choices showing the transformation. The father remains off-page, reducing relationship pressure to declaration rather than dramatized friction. Marcus's blind spots and costs are asserted rather than shown constraining his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's choice to shed her masculine disguise and wade toward Cetacea emerges from consistent interiority about performing masculinity as protection-turned-prison. The transformation moment ("The bindings she'd worn felt suddenly absurd") lands with embodied specificity. However, the transformation comes swiftly after acquiring the scrimshaw without meaningful internal contradiction or cost—the disguise simply dissolves when convenience demands. Secondary characters (Torven, the assembled seekers) apply thematic pressure but remain largely emblematic rather than forcing Mira into difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The performer's blank affect and mechanical narration create a convincing embodied resistance strategy, and Mrs. Chen's grief-carrying arc is earned through concrete gestures (touching the crumbling petal). The moral ambiguity lives authentically in the performer's neither-rebel-nor-conformist stance without hedging. Minor slip: the performer's interiority remains opaque throughout, making her final choice to leave feel more structural than motivated by visible internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    Silas moves through abstract interior states without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His motivation—striding through boundaries—is declared and performed but never tested by a competing impulse or cost that forces him to choose between incompatible goods. The arrival of other poets in the final third feels externally triggered rather than earned by his prior agency, and no visible forfeiture occurs on the page. Interiority relies on lyric assertion ("tremor of certainty," "aesthetically driven") rather than concrete perception that degrades or sharpens under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's colorblindness is integrated through her observation methods and the flower-language system, but her choices remain largely instrumental rather than forced by internal contradiction. The bartering dynamic and her reading of Enzo's grief show character-particular perception. Enzo's arc from burned letters to flower arrangement is clean, though his transformation occurs mostly off-page between scenes. The daughter's brief appearance at the end doesn't add pressure; she arrives as resolution rather than complication.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's internal journey from ritual performer to improviser shows clear motivation, but the change feels more thematic assertion than earned struggle. The grandmother's lens functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a lived contradiction that forces difficult choice. Interiority leans toward articulate epiphany ("not a monument to absence, but a cathedral of potential") rather than embodied confusion under pressure. The final stance—architect of moments—arrives through reflection more than costly action that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's interiority is established through concrete, embodied detail (silver wire coiling beneath steady hands, recognizing fresh grief in the stranger's posture), and her micro-choices reveal her values—lighting candles as a beacon, folding cranes with coordinates, deciding to attempt the phoenix tattoo "tomorrow." The transformation from suicidal despair to subdued healing is credible, though the final pivot to applying the stencil feels slightly telescoped. Secondary character (the visiting woman) applies immediate pressure by mirroring Elena's past state, forcing her to articulate her own progress, but the interaction remains more illustrative than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation to map cultural patterns is consistent, and her method shows professional competence, but internal contradiction is absent—she moves through her work with steady confidence rather than visible struggle. The relationship with Marcus functions more as exposition vehicle than crucible; no pressure between them alters either character's state. The trait "steadily curious" appears as label rather than lived contradiction that costs her something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's training and goal are declared but her internal contradiction never acts simultaneously in scene—she moves through tiers processing memories without visible struggle between want and cost until the climactic inhalation. The transformation at the pagoda's seventh tier summarizes emotional processing ("anguish into something else") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. Her final walk past guardians shows endurance but the choice to inhale the plague feels more like fulfilling a pre-set role than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve dreams is stated but never tested by an on-page choice with cost. Her interior consists largely of discovery-summary ("she understood," "she recognized") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother exists only in reflective backstory, never applying pressure to Mira's present decisions. The final transcription feels like a thesis statement rather than an action that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interiority is specific and embodied—removing bio-chips "peeling away another layer of deception" grounds her internal shift in concrete action. Her motivations are clear and conflicted: desperation justified the con, but now she owns the harm. The final choice (public confession, rehoming animals) is earned by the surgery's physical and moral precision. Minor slip: "she found something she'd lost" approaches diagnostic self-awareness, though the qualifying phrase "not redemption exactly" pulls back just enough.

    Maya's wound-seeking compulsion is established and her interior voice is distinctive (vegetable grief, libraries written in collagen), but the final "learning" feels more declared than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The scar-reading motivation drives several micro-choices (examining coffee rings, pressing palm to glass), yet the epiphany that "wounds were meant to stay open" arrives as insight rather than a dramatized cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present (unsteady walk, examining bandaged hands) but the piece leans toward poetic articulation over messy contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's interiority is rich and embodied ("tasting silver and salt"), with her psychometric gift shaping perception consistently. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective processing of absorbed emotions rather than dramatized choices under pressure—Vera observes and feels but makes only one concrete decision (taking the film). The final act of kissing and pocketing the strip arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading more as symbolic gesture than character-altering choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyra's motivation—to free trapped creativity—drives her forward, but her interior remains abstract and label-heavy ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture"). The pivotal moment of surrender ("allowing her consciousness to drift upward") is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final dissolution lacks visible cost tied to prior character work; she "smiles as she felt herself beginning to fade" without dramatized struggle or trade-off, reading more as cosmic acceptance than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kess demonstrates consistent motivation (protecting cargo, cultivating sparks) and her skill at charming wave functions is established and used under pressure. Internal life is present through her relationship to the frozen clock and the lullaby, though emotion tends toward poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The confrontation choice feels earned, but the pirate's threat and Kess's response resolve too smoothly—she sings, reality "chooses her version," and he disperses without visible cost or struggle that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The philosopher's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His motivations are declared ("unravel the careful knots that bound imagination") but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. The "wild frontier" epiphany feels unearned—he simply remembers rather than struggles toward insight through dramatized action. Internal conflict is absent; he moves smoothly from discovery to promise without genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation to find her dog opens clearly but her interior journey from fear-of-letting-go to openness feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The metaphorical dog as "unleashed joy" arrives without prior dramatized contradiction between holding on and releasing. Embodied emotion is present ("calling his name until her voice went hoarse") but the final transformation lacks visible cost: she simply "knew how to open" without forfeiting a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation to remain and understand is told rather than shown through consequential micro-choices under pressure. His frostbite recovery functions as atmospheric detail but doesn't constrain present decisions. Elena's return registers more as symbolic fulfillment than earned character agency—her seven-year absence and throat surgeries are summarized, not dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final exchange with the bolt feels like ceremony rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Syln's agency is clear—she gathers pellets, leaves messages, orchestrates the final reveal—and her devotion to truth coheres across the piece. Internal contradiction is minimal; her motives remain static rather than evolving under pressure. The pretender's entrance feels more like a plot delivery device than a character whose choices shape the turn; his "perfect composure cracked" is told rather than embodied in contradiction or micro-choice. The true heir's arrival lacks any interiority or friction, reducing him to a plot token.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lena's interior life is established through concrete actions (tapping rhythms, checking instruments, reading the diary) and her detective-like assembly of fragments shows clear motivation. However, her grandmother functions more as a device than a pressure point—the relationship lacks emotional contradictions or cost. The decision to descend feels driven by conceptual realization rather than competing desires or genuine risk to her professional standing. The "keeper of patterns, a rememberer of what was periodically eternal" edges toward mystical abstraction without grounding in embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is specific and embodied—"awkwardly confident…as if she perpetually stood on the edge of falling into grace"—and her movements carry physical detail. However, her realization feels more delivered than earned: the opera/pause insight and the decision to bring others tomorrow arrive without visible cost or internal contradiction. The protagonist's shift from solitary observer to orchestrator lacks friction; no prior desire is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Grandmother Chen's motivation to resist the Authority is clear, but her interior life is thin—her decision to unseal the amber feels more structural than psychologically earned. The plant-consciousness trait functions as a plot device rather than a source of genuine internal conflict or contradiction. Supporting characters (Li, the lieutenant) appear only as functionaries without applying meaningful interpersonal pressure. The final choice lacks visible cost; Chen's stance crystallization reads declarative rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amira's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers (flutter beneath ribs, heat in palms, cold at spine) that shape on-page micro-choices. Her contradictory impulses—grief versus cultivation—act simultaneously in scene rather than alternating summaries. The final endurance (returning tomorrow despite violence continuing) feels earned by prior causality and forecloses magical-thinking escape with visible cost. Minor slip: Dr. Mansour's diagnostic framework risks therapy-speak, though it remains anchored in bodily sensation rather than pure label.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's motivation—portrait painter confronting fragmented perception—is coherent and drives choices across the piece. Interiority relies heavily on rhetorical questions and symbolic revelation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The epiphany ("every broken thing was whole in its own dimension") arrives as a stated insight rather than emerging through a difficult on-page micro-choice with visible cost. Emotional embodiment leans toward lyric declaration ("cracked and luminous with grief") more than specific, character-particular sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The tracker remains abstract throughout—"consciously wild methodology" and "serene anger" are labels without dramatized internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The character observes and records but makes no visible decision that narrows options or forecloses a path; her final transformation into "one with the mystery" is asserted rather than earned through on-page causality. The interiority relies on stock phrases ("balance of scientific rigor and intuitive wildness") and diagnostic self-awareness ("that peculiar quality of serene anger she'd cultivated"). No embodied emotion or contradictory impulses act in scene; the protagonist functions as a device for exposition rather than a flawed mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear—archivist oath versus truth-telling—but her inner conflict is more declared than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decisive action (initiating the upload and cascade failure) is motivated by the letter and prior history, though the twelve-year patience followed by immediate betrayal feels compressed. Embodied emotion appears in moments like "fingers found each scanner with practiced precision" and "smiled with the terrible peace," but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("bravely conflicted") and the overly articulate final insight dilute interiority. The cost is visible—she faces arrest—but the emotional progression from doubt to "terrible peace" resolves too tidily for the magnitude of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear—cultivation as antidote to violence—and her choices (finishing her round despite her father's early return, leading him to the rose) reflect patient interiority. However, the father's arc is summarized rather than embodied: "something shift in his expression" and his kneeling gesture are told, not shown through contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal conflict. The final planting scene avoids dramatizing the father's struggle to adopt her method; instead, the prose asserts he is "learning" and "understanding finally," which reads as label-only transformation. Internal texture for Mira is consistent but the father's renunciation lacks visible cost or embodied resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kova's cool-headed training is established early and embodied through specific actions: steadying her breath, voicing silence as paradox, maintaining stillness while her heart hammers. The seven-year preparation and the discipline to remain still "as winter lakes while chaos churned beneath" create clear internal contradiction. The final change—receiving the echo and walking home with it incorporated into her voice—feels earned by her sustained effort, though the actual moment of yielding ("not captured but choosing to be held") softens agency slightly. The embodied emotion (determination as amber streams, fear as ice bells) avoids diagnostic labels and grounds her state in the fantastical world's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Margot's observant nature is embodied through concrete gestures (tracking the pen's shadow, noticing light on her father's ring) and her internal contradiction between truth-seeking and empire-protection drives the final choice. The decision to create a third false narrative shows genuine internal conflict between transparency and preservation. However, the characterization leans heavily on intellectual puzzle-solving rather than visceral emotional stakes; her "mournful and amused" laugh tells more than it shows. The renunciation of honesty carries conceptual weight but limited felt cost—we don't see what she personally loses beyond abstract "honesty."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear—translate pain to give ghosts memorial—and her amber-mediated perception feels specific. However, her professional competence dominates; we see no genuine struggle, no contradictory impulse that might complicate her task. The ending choice (writing the letters in 30 years) is asserted rather than earned by on-page conflict. Dr. Kepler remains a functional prop, applying no pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraphina's social perceptiveness is established but operates more as a static trait than a driver of contradictory impulses under pressure. Her realization about the unlearning arrives as insight rather than earned through dramatized struggle with competing desires. The mandala work provides embodied activity, but the protagonist's emotional progression from anxiety to acceptance feels smoothly calibrated rather than messy and contradictory in the moment. The final choice to leave the mandala reads as thematically predetermined rather than a decision with visible psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sarai's core motivation is clear and her internal conflict between guilt and purpose drives choices. The embodied emotion is strong in key moments ("weeping—not from sorrow, but from a strange, cold warmth"), and her decision to shift from restoration to transformation shows earned change. However, the old man functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying meaningful pressure, and some interiority leans toward label-speak ("aberrant mercy," "gentle radical") that could be more dramatized through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cornelius's synesthetic perception is embodied through concrete sensory crossings (honey-copper applause, cardamom echoes, strawberry-silver voice) that function as perceptual signature. His motivation—seeking Isabella through temporal manipulation—drives choices across beats. The final choice to perform together earns their reunion through accumulated echoes, though the path feels more inevitable than conflicted; internal contradiction is minimal, and the stakes never force him to weigh competing costs or renounce a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's somatic markers provide a concrete interiority method, and her body-driven navigation through the studio shows embodied decision-making. However, David remains largely functional—his skepticism-to-wonder arc is told through summary ("his skepticism softening," "understanding flooding") rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final convergence feels unearned because we never see David struggle with competing desires or make a micro-choice that costs him something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is concrete and specific—her modified sensory perception and embodied experience are well-realized. The motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" is declared but not meaningfully tested through conflict; her final choice (teaching others) feels asserted rather than earned through a dramatized internal contradiction. The fossil crumbles as a threshold marker, but the forfeiture of one path over another lacks visible cost or struggle. Minor deduction: the character's capabilities are detailed but no genuine limits or blind spots create inevitable mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation (preserving/spinning futures) is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her seventeen-year tenure and the revelation arrive without visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply "understood her true purpose" and continues her work. The final choice to open the jar lacks any genuine resistance or trade-off. Internal conflict is absent; she moves through epiphany to action without embodied struggle or consequences that alter her options.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margot's motivations are clear—she seeks resolution after betrayal—and her final choice to deliver the folder feels earned by the scene's pressure. However, her interiority relies heavily on retrospective summary ("Three years of running, hiding, surviving") rather than embodied contradiction in the present moment. Viktor's motivations are functional but he exists primarily as an exposition delivery device; his emotions are asserted ("wind and worry") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The closure choice forecloses a path but lacks visible internal friction; Margot moves from anger to acceptance too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thomas's thirty-year accretion of understanding reads credibly, and the woman's "particular shadow" of broken promises shows embodied perception. The protagonist's decision to ease her burden without erasing it reflects genuine moral calculus. Interior access remains consistent, though Thomas's "spindrift serenity" occasionally tilts toward label rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The woman's nod and tears carry weight, but her stake remains externally described rather than chosen on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's motivation to understand timeline resistance is established early and drives her journey, but her interior life remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The potter's muscle memory and measured movements provide embodied detail, yet critical choices feel more like recognitions than decisions under pressure. The final understanding arrives as epiphany rather than emerging from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "patient as fired clay" analogy and craft metaphors are consistent but risk becoming decorative rather than constraining actual on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied perception (the gauge "warm in her hand," matching breath with the rower), and her micro-choices—kneeling, wedging the gauge, walking away—ground the arc. However, the character work leans heavily on reflective summary ("it was about more than vegetables"; "she understood now why she'd come") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation reads as pre-decided meditation rather than a choice forced by live pressure, and the closure cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's motivation to translate isolation into independence is stated clearly but remains abstract through most of the piece. The realization "We weren't preserved to recreate the past... We're here to coexist with its absence" arrives as declared insight rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Her interior life relies heavily on exposition about past lives and dormant memories rather than embodied contradiction in the present scene. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost—she sets down the sundial and finds purpose, but no path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior life is accessible and her profession shapes perception, but her motives remain largely told rather than tested under meaningful pressure. The central revelation—"we're all writing the same love letter"—arrives as insight without dramatized internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. Chen's discovery of her ghostwriting and his accusation are referenced in backstory but never pressure her choices on the page. The final hand-holding feels like emotional convergence without embodied contradiction or a hierarchy of values made legible through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's motivation to expose the deception is clear, but her interior life remains thin—label-only feelings ("grimly," "trembling fingers") replace embodied contradictions. The AI antagonist lacks on-page presence; Maya never wrestles with doubt or cost beyond technical problem-solving. Her competence is unbalanced by genuine struggle: she decodes the subsonic trick by accident (coffee mug vibration) and counters it smoothly without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The ending credits her "stubborn determination" via tell, not dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's claustrophobia provides consistent motivation and embodied anxiety ("clawing at his chest"), and the final transformation reads as earned through his journey. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("something altogether more paradoxical") rather than concrete sensory pressure, and the contradiction between fear and planning is told more than dramatized through micro-choices. The protagonist's agency at key moments (touching the compass, following the music) feels passive—he is guided rather than choosing under conflicting pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sarah's prosopagnosia and methodical process anchor her interiority with specificity ("her fingers finding the detective's number by touch alone"). The character shows consistent internal logic through her reliance on texture and systematic arrangement. However, her emotional arc remains largely static—she begins methodical and ends methodical, with no visible cost or contradiction acting in scene. The final insight feels delivered rather than earned through a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation to honor her ancestor is clearly established and drives her actions throughout. Her idealistic certainty and nervously confident energy are mentioned but remain largely label-only rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The shift from "spongey dread" to "weight of inherited responsibility" reads as emotional summary rather than dramatized transformation. Dr. Hayward exists primarily as an intercom voice to deliver exposition and evacuation warnings without applying meaningful interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marla's interior world is established through her observational skills and musical bridge-building, but her agency remains largely reactive—she receives the glass flake, plays backward, and observes the hitchhiker's return without difficult choices that foreclose paths. The emotional progression from confusion to understanding lacks embodied contradiction; she moves smoothly from bewilderment to epiphany without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The final stance—accepting her role as "ferryman of forgiveness"—arrives through revelation rather than a choice with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized rather than enacted in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is established through perceptive observation and methodical action, with interior specificity ("perceptive calm he'd inherited from generations") and embodied choices (rearranging bills, leaving artifacts). However, his interiority remains largely observational rather than contradictory—he watches, plans, and executes without internal friction. The final conversation with Chen feels more like thematic explication than a choice under pressure; Marcus's stance crystallizes but without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page. Chen's brief arc (recognizing the trap, dissolving TerraLoop) supplies the story's only meaningful change, yet he remains secondary and his decision occurs off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is declared but thin; her "unique gift" to heal with words never constrains a choice or creates internal conflict. The discovery arc (telegram → understanding) follows a clean line, but the protagonist remains observational rather than struggling with contradictory impulses. The collective burden is asserted thematically but does not dramatize Mira wrestling with a personal cost that forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kael's motivation is clear—prove his bloodline's innocence—but his interior life remains thin, dominated by telling rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery of the ancestor's true intent registers as exposition ("understood now") rather than a micro-choice under pressure. "Warlike serenity" and "guarded expression" are repeated labels without specific physical manifestation. The final stance crystallizes but the path there lacks visible internal friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's root-bound nature is established through claim rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "purposeful curiosity" is asserted repeatedly but never tests competing desires or forces a visible tradeoff. The ending choice to "sign her name in starlight" arrives without prior dramatized resistance or cost—she simply accepts her role. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("anxious elation," "intersection of dreams") rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's reckless idealism is established early and drives her choice to consume Elena's apple, but the internal contradiction needed for high-band work is thin—she moves from grief to resolution without wrestling meaningfully with competing impulses on the page. The "fiercely gentle" trait is told through Elena's memory rather than embodied in Mara's present choices. The keeper's dialogue does useful character work, but Elena remains a narrative object rather than a presence that creates live tension. The final transformation feels declared rather than earned through visible micro-choices that foreclose options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is concrete and grounded in embodied memory—his fingers recognizing the cloth, the B-flat hum triggering visceral recall. Internal contradiction operates well in the cataloging-as-defense mechanism versus the breakthrough moment of genuine recognition. The phone call demonstrates a meaningful shift earned by prior pressure, though the "longing not as emptiness but as space" moment skirts diagnostic abstraction. Minor: the emotional progression from shame to authority reads slightly telescoped in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sarah's choices trace to professional devotion, but her interiority is largely summary and abstraction ("haunted by ambitions," "kindly methodical nature"). The pivotal decision to consume the seed lacks embodied hesitation or contradictory impulses acting in scene; we get a single paragraph of reflection followed by immediate action. The priest-scientist's presence offers backstory weight, but Sarah's own emotional progression feels narrated rather than dramatized, especially at the moment she "placed the seed on her tongue."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaine's motivation to preserve wonder and her acceptance of mechanical/organic duality are established, but her choices feel contemplative rather than tested under pressure. The visitor's transformation is observed rather than dramatized through Kaine's active participation—she guides but doesn't face a meaningful internal conflict or cost. The titan-gear framework and moon-phase fluctuation are told as settled facts without on-page contradiction or stakes. Embodied emotion is sparse; "smiled, an expression that creaked slightly" leans ornamental rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear—fear of vulnerability drives her bunker work—and the final choice to reach out is earned by Crown's confessions. However, the interiority leans heavily on therapy-speak ("professional armor," "walls she'd built") and the epiphany arrives too cleanly without sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The etching moment provides embodied agency, but the ease of her transformation undercuts the weight of years-long patterns. Marcus and her mother exist only as named absences rather than pressures that complicate her present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus exhibits clear motivation rooted in guilt, with contradictory impulses evident in his oscillation between scientific documentation and emotional evasion. The interior work is strong—"daringly methodical even then, following his sampling protocols while a life slipped under"—and the final choice to write "Mile marker zero" with no map feels earned by prior causality. Minor weakness: the bellows action feels somewhat illustrative rather than fully embodied under pressure. The therapy-speak phrase "raw solace" in the final paragraph edges toward diagnostic labeling but is framed as Marcus's own observation rather than narratorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The veiled dreamer remains largely observational throughout; her "choices" are passive documentation rather than decisions that narrow options under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through the library in a state of wonder without conflicting impulses. The final unveiling reads as symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost, and the claim that she "had always been both the seeker and the keeper" arrives as assertion rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal conflict between career ambition and ethical responsibility is established, but her decision to forge documents feels insufficiently motivated—the pivot from authentication to active fraud happens too quickly without embodied doubt or contradiction. The mulberry-wine taste metaphor attempts to convey ambivalence but remains decorative rather than reflecting genuine psychological wrestling. Marcus is functional but one-dimensional; his recognition scene at the end lacks prior cues of capacity for moral reckoning. The jasmine's telepathic warnings and Elara's final coffee-reading feel like convenient plot devices rather than character-driven choices with visible internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority remains abstract and label-heavy throughout: "lucidly watchful," "calculated," "measured" are stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her decision to infuse the chip feels predetermined rather than earned by on-page conflict between wants and costs. The star's "dying days" teaching and her "months seeking" are told-only backstory that doesn't alter present choices. Her final stance—suspended between states—lacks visible cost; we see transformation but not renunciation or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life shows clear motivation (seeking contentment post-betrayal) and her caretaker role is embodied through concrete actions like climbing and guiding pilgrims. The grandmother encounter delivers an epiphany about eternal return, but the realization arrives through explanation rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final contentment feels declared ("content at last") rather than earned through a visible on-page renunciation or decision with cost. Internal contradiction is present early (forgiveness as "merely another turn") but flattens into acceptance by the end without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus shows embodied grief and the performance of "sincerely insincere" wealth, but the narrator remains more cipher than character—serving primarily as a mouthpiece for thematic insight. The daughter's absolute morality is told rather than dramatized through choice, weakening the emotional core. Internal contradiction appears in Marcus's protective vulnerability, but the narrator's detachment prevents full engagement with contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice—whether Marcus will "grow into his complexity"—is deferred rather than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's reverse-aging is presented but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost on the page. Marcus exists only to receive exposition; no relationship pressure emerges. The character's stated motivations ("weaving truth carefully") remain abstract labels rather than dramatized trade-offs. Internal contradiction is absent—she executes her lesson plan smoothly without embodied struggle or micro-choices that reveal competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Yula's motivation (learning to navigate without moving) is coherent and embodied through her three-hundred-year stillness, with the arrowhead functioning as a focal object. Her final exchange with her younger voice shows a stance crystallization, though the cost remains abstract—three centuries have passed, but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and maintains a meditative register consistent with the premise. The protagonist's agency is renunciation/endurance, fitting Earned Stasis, but the emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, trending toward summary of her evolution rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority carries distinct perceptual bias ("light that wasn't quite light, existing in that space between sunset and true dark"), and her trajectory from Academy failure to mist-walking acceptance is clear. However, the final transformation reads as declarative epiphany rather than embodied contradiction under pressure: "she had found the most powerful magic of all" tells rather than enacts the shift. Emotional progression relies on abstract philosophical reflection ("the last sacred act was imperfection") instead of micro-choices with visible cost at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlow's motivation is clear and her synesthesia trait is embodied through sensory descriptions, but her choices lack visible cost. The sister backstory anchors the search but the discovery of Elena's journal resolves too easily—Marlow accepts the "luminous vows" without internal friction or trade-off. The ending pivot to "teaching others" emerges without on-page struggle or path foreclosure. Interior voice remains consistent but the arc reads more as revelation than transformation earned through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Keeper Voss demonstrates coherent motivation through repeated coin-casting that drives her understanding backward through time. Interiority is occasionally over-elevated ("cognitive dissonance of existing in a causal loop") but the embodied gestures—running fingers across coins, pressing palms to walls—ground key beats. The final "understanding through infinite repetition" earns her stance, though the emotional arc remains somewhat abstract. Internal contradiction is present (doubt versus enthusiasm) but could deepen through more immediate micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The reaper's interiority is concrete and her choice to name her fears shows earned agency. However, the protagonist's emotional journey lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves from grief to understanding in a clean arc without messy resistance. The sacrifice backstory provides clear motivation but arrives as exposition rather than complicating present choices. The final decision to make recordings feels logical but not inevitable from internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her "lukewarm" magic constrains her approach, but interiority relies heavily on summary ("she'd discovered," "she theorized") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The Academy's laughter and her father's death are told backstory that primes but doesn't actively complicate present choices. The final collapse reads as exhaustion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Competence overwhelms genuine struggle; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned without meaningful error or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is established (documenting the town's emergence, later pivoting to preserving Elena's story), and his grandmother connection provides grounding. However, the character remains largely observational through most beats; the key "decision" to write Elena's name beneath photographs is told rather than dramatized with visible internal conflict. Interiority stays surface-level—"Marcus understood his role now" arrives as epiphany rather than earned struggle. The final stance feels assigned by authorial need rather than forged through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vera's internal contradiction between logic and wonder is established but arrives largely through reflective assertion rather than dramatized pressure. Her micro-choices—pressing the waterfall, releasing the crystal—emerge from contemplation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandfather functions as backstory anchor but does not apply on-page pressure. Embodied emotion is present ("heart quickened," warming crystal) but remains intermittent; peak moments lean toward label-speak ("ancient freshness," "touch of wonder") rather than particularized sensation.

    Maya's motivation is clear and her interior contradiction (corporate duty vs. environmental preservation) drives the central choice. The parachute-buckle nervous habit adds embodied texture, but the final decision feels somewhat under-pressured—she gives up the encrypted drives without visible struggle between competing loyalties. The breathing-pattern observation and her interpretive leap ("I understood immediately") shortcut the dramatization of her decision process. The choice to lie about timeline ("six months") adds complexity, but the cost of this choice isn't fully embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus's motivation is declared (numbness, seeking to "feel") but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sparring scene offers kinetic movement but no meaningful internal struggle—he simply "understands flooding through" without cost or friction. The duplicate remains entirely off-page, so the custody conflict never pressures Marcus's choices in scene. Therapy-speak pervades ("ego death," "remember terror," "numbness is just possibility") without grounding in specific sensation or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and embodied through his "mournfully eager" stance and ritualistic preparation, but his interiority remains largely decorative—no competing impulses or genuine struggle appears until the moment of conducting. The Hendricks family's grief is richly specific (Emma's laugh about the cat, the mother's swallowed laugh), yet they exist as recipients rather than agents, limiting emotional friction. The transformation from silence to laughter feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. Backstory about Bobby exceeds 20% without sufficient present-tense micro-decisions to anchor it, per BRR.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The guardian's interior is vivid and embodied throughout—"ice crystals formed in her thoughts," bare feet that "left no prints"—and the final choice to step through with the scholar is earned by the sustained homesickness and the pendant's function. The scholar's motives are clean and goal-driven. Minor weakness: the guardian's loss of speech feels asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices; we see the clicking growls but not the moment-by-moment struggle to form words until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular ("felt everything more keenly"), with embodied motivation driving the transformation attempt. The thirty-year backstory establishes credible stakes, but the final moment leans toward label-speak ("altogether more dangerous—a man who'd learned to vivify through destruction") rather than letting action speak. Internal contradiction appears briefly (destruction vs. preservation) but doesn't complicate the climactic choice—he proceeds without hesitation or visible trade-off once the insight lands.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's professional history and her choice to pursue the shard are clearly motivated, and her decision at the end to teach others shows agency. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—she enters seeking the shard, finds it smoothly, and emerges with a resolved plan. The bodily tingles and amber glow provide some embodiment, but the peak experience in the silence reads as passive reception rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "tune her life differently" arrives without visible cost or friction that would foreclose another path.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marcus's motivation is stated rather than tested. The "resiliently positive nature undimmed by the existential weight" is label-only assertion; no on-page choice shows him choosing optimism over despair under concrete pressure. His decision to initiate convergence appears unmotivated—three years of collecting fragments is told in summary without showing what micro-choices led him to act tonight. The woman passenger and parallel selves are gestural presences without relationship friction or status dynamics that would force Marcus's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    The architect remains label-driven throughout: "fever dream," "rational enchantment," "unsettling calm" declare rather than embody interior contradiction. No on-page choice with visible cost; she completes her weaving unopposed, and the ending smile signals satisfaction without trade-off or foreclosed path. Interiority consists of abstract claims ("consciousness itself was merely another pattern") rather than embodied struggle. The final walk toward "the exit that was also an entrance" gestures at paradox but does not dramatize what she loses or renounces.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation is declared but not tested under pressure; she teaches, observes, and reflects without making a single difficult choice that would reveal character under duress. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through wonder and acceptance without friction. The students and the Depth Dweller remain passive agents who receive instruction rather than apply pressure that forces micro-choices. Torres's "balancedly curious" question is label-only; no visible cost or tradeoff dramatizes the trait.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and her observational lens is character-specific, filtering the atrium through audiological and emotional-tracking expertise. However, the final breakthrough—understanding the memory theft—arrives through hearing-aid pulses rather than a dramatized on-page choice that closes off other paths. Interiority is vivid ("copper on her tongue") but the climactic realization feels more delivered than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "hadn't meant to be a hero" refrain reads as gentle authorial positioning rather than embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's claustrophobia is embodied ("chest tightened," "walls pressing inward") and her motivation to honor Marcus drives the descent with visible cost. The interiority remains concrete throughout, particularly in the phase-chamber confrontation where past promise collides with present fear. Minor deduction: Marcus exists only as preserved memory without contradictory impulses; Elena's internal conflict could deepen further in the peak beat where she adjusts the chamber field.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and embodied through the heartbeat counting ritual, which grounds physical presence against digital dissolution. The motivation to reconnect with his digital ghost is clear, though the internal contradiction between wanting to correct the error versus embracing the evolution feels underplayed until the final third. The "understanding dawned" moment at 150 beats reads slightly thin—the shift from problem-solving to acceptance happens through assertion rather than a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost. Embodied details (trembling fingers, breath clouding) anchor emotional states effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The copper-veined storyteller remains largely abstract—her physical traits are detailed but her interior contradiction and agency are thin. The piece tells us she "needed to hear the texture" but we never see her wrestling with doubt or cost in real time; the transformation into a bone tower reads more as mythic summary than earned character arc. The final choice to become part of the canyon feels imposed by the story's lyric design rather than motivated by on-page struggle. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are absent in favor of atmospheric declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's motivation is present but feels abstractly declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision to "join them" arrives without on-page struggle between her FBI role, grief for her brother, and the cost of transformation. Thorne's arc from grief to acceptance happens too cleanly in dialogue without embodied resistance. Internal states are often told through therapy-adjacent language ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") rather than shown through micro-choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lira's interiority operates through embodied perception—the locust shell stirring "something in her chest," fingers "finding notes that shouldn't exist." Her motivation to reawaken beauty drives concrete choices: mapping buried rhythms for weeks, calibrating melody to ghost-rhythms. However, the final paragraph's "playing herself empty, becoming the shell another's freedom might require" edges toward abstract self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis. The statues' awakening is dramatized through physical breakdown (gears grinding, clockwork shattering), but their interior shifts remain largely asserted rather than shown through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezra's motivations are consistent—delivering the forbidden bottle and fostering connections across the border—but his interior life remains thin. The Keeper's sudden appearance provides exposition rather than genuine confrontation, and Ezra's choices feel predetermined rather than pressured by competing impulses. The "respectfully rebellious" trait is asserted through narration but never tested by a moment where obedience and defiance create genuine friction with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Emil's interiority is concrete and embodied through craft and silence; his seven-year muteness earns the singing climax through prior particulars (grandfather's melody, fragment discovery). The choice to sing is motivated by accumulated pressure rather than sudden epiphany. Minor slip: "understanding dawning like sunrise through fog" edges toward stock phrasing, and the final promise to "teach the horses to sing" risks sentiment, but the core arc of silence-to-song holds with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is established through consistent interior voice and the scarf motif, but his choices remain largely observational until the final vision—no forked-path decision with visible cost appears on the page. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("sanely eccentric") but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat. The grandmother's influence anchors motivation, yet the climactic "understanding" reads as epiphany without prior struggle that would earn it causally.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mara's interior contradiction (searching vs. waiting; spending her own capacity for feeling) is embodied in concrete actions—positioning the palette, setting it down. The grandmother's deathbed moment anchors motivation effectively. However, the protagonist's emotional progression through seven years of searching feels summarized rather than dramatically tested on the page; the pivotal choice arrives without on-page struggle that would earn the renunciation. The final insight ("Some longings were meant to remain ciphers") reads as slightly over-articulated wisdom rather than emerging strictly from embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's motivation to free the imprisoned idea is stated but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or embodied struggle. Her "unassumingly bold nature" remains a label rather than showing contradictory desires acting simultaneously under pressure. The climactic moment—"her fingers bled from handling the sharp edges of collective doubt"—relies on metaphorical abstraction rather than concrete physical or emotional stakes that would ground her choice. Internal experience is narrated through therapy-adjacent language ("fear had become the jailer") without the messy irrationality or flawed decision-making that would make her human.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Margaret's motivation is consistent (recover Gran's memories) and her folklorist background shapes her pattern-detection approach. However, the final choice lacks visible internal contradiction—she reaches into the ring without meaningful hesitation or cost to herself, and the memory absorption feels consequence-free. The ending grants her "heavy" knowledge but no dramatized struggle with what she's taken on or what she's sacrificed to gain it. Interiority remains serviceable but never fully embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's interior is concrete and specific—her backward walking habit signals anxiety without label-speak, and her choice to teach Kess rather than immediately reveal the mother's shadow demonstrates genuine internal tension between hope-as-weapon and compassion. The final teaching moment ("I'm teaching you to save yourself when your turn comes") earns its weight through the prior annotation work. Kess's arc from raw grief to understanding is compressed but credible, driven by micro-choices (lunging forward, tracing the spiral). Minor weakness: Elara's past betrayal by Kess's mother is told rather than dramatized in a present friction that would test her motives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's sixty years of experience and her specific pruning gift are established early, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"insatiably creative mind" is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final planting sequence demonstrates methodical competence without visible struggle or doubt that would reveal character complexity. Her decision to plant the seed feels preordained rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing desires or fears. The story tells us she "understood" and "knew" without dramatizing the moment of choice that forecloses other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her craft drives the action, but interiority remains largely operational rather than contradictory. The spirits' gratitude "filled the space between heartbeats" edges toward abstraction where embodied tension would strengthen. Her final understanding that "tomorrow would bring another net" reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The work is competent but lacks the internal friction that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and specific ("methodically curious nature demanding precision"), and her motivation to understand silence and empathy drives her physical journey. However, the final choice to visit the moorland feels inevitable rather than a genuine decision under competing pressures—she encounters no internal contradiction or friction that might foreclose another path. The "shielded openness" transformation is asserted more than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes drifts toward therapy-speak ("protection without isolation, revelation without exposure").

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete, character-particular perception ("death's language," monitoring frequencies "for decades"). The captain's journal evolution from "confident strokes to increasingly frantic calculations" dramatizes his arc off-page but Marina's present choices—photographing, writing her own note, deciding what to preserve—are purposeful and grounded in her established expertise. Internal contradiction appears subtly: she understands "preservation and release are the same motion" yet still seals artifacts in a specimen container, a micro-tension that enriches without resolving neatly. Minor slip: her transformation feels more articulated than earned by on-page pressure; the insight arrives through contemplation rather than a crucible choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Chorus has clear motivations (to voice the voiceless) and the story tracks her micro-choices through the courtyard and workshop. However, her decisions feel contemplative rather than forged under genuine contradictory pressure—she drifts alert but never wrestles with competing impulses in scene. The ghost's loneliness is told through graffiti rather than embodied in Chorus's own stakes, and the final "purpose found" moment reads as epiphany delivered rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior is textured—drawn to tenderness in technical notes, seeking beauty within isolation—and her motivations cohere around parallel grief and curiosity. The protagonist remains primarily observer until the final third; her choices (taking the diary, deciding to return tomorrow) feel more like confirmations than high-stakes reversals that foreclose options. The final "enkrypt her own [joy]" moment edges toward self-aware epiphany without sufficient dramatized struggle. Thorne's characterization is vivid through absence but never tested on the page, limiting dynamic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena's interiority is concrete and particular—her observation work and inherited obsession feel character-specific. Her decision to refuse rescue and remain untethered shows agency under pressure, though the final choice (closing the logbook, accepting the memory cycle) lacks visible internal contradiction or cost that would elevate it. The embodied details (telescope warming, gondola sway) ground her perceptual signature, but the ending reads more as philosophical acceptance than a difficult forfeiture with felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's prosopagnosia is established early and shapes her tactile method, but her interior life remains largely abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to keep the coin reads as thematically inevitable rather than earned through on-page pressure between competing wants. Embodied emotion is sparse; moments like "pressed her palm against the coin one final time" gesture toward feeling without specific bodily cost. The transformation from "couldn't see faces" to recognizing "the library had a face too" lands as epiphany-by-assertion rather than discovery under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's diligent curiosity is demonstrated through concrete observation and pattern-matching, with micro-choices (adjusting the airship's course, following murmurations) that advance discovery. However, her motivation lacks genuine internal conflict—the isolation is declared "sociable somehow" without cost, and no competing impulse challenges her arc. The breakthrough moment "understanding flooding through her" relies on epiphany rather than earned struggle, and the final stance (following starlings, translating language) mirrors her opening behavior without visible foreclosure or alteration. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the arc is accretive documentation rather than transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's internal arc from forcing locks to patient listening is clear and motivated by the village failure, embodied through her grandfather's gears as teachers. The emotional progression works—shame driving haste, then understanding driving patience—but the epiphany ("the gentle conversation between mechanism and hand") arrives largely through mirror-vision rather than through earned struggle in scene. Interiority stays concrete until the mirrors show her past selves; that moment risks convenient revelation but the cost (three days' climb, winter darkness continuing) keeps stakes tangible. The choice to descend and wait three months for the next eclipse forecloses immediate action with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marina's ghost exists primarily to deliver convenient solutions rather than face contradictory impulses; her motivation to help is stated but never tested against a competing desire or cost to herself. The families receive superficial characterization through their actions (bringing samples, tearing down fences) but no individual wrestles with doubt or pays a visible personal price for changing course. The transformation from suspicion to cooperation happens through Marina's orchestration rather than through earned struggle, and the ending's fade feels like a reward rather than a choice with foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is vivid and particular ("light through a prism," "electricity through water"), but his transformation from adjuster to singer feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The shift happens through mystical transmission ("felt the weight of her story flooding through") rather than a dramatized internal conflict that forecloses options. Eliza's backstory provides mythic weight but Marcus's agency in the present remains passive—he receives, understands, and obeys rather than wrestles with contradictory impulses in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara's character is coherent and her motivations are clear: she remains bound by duty and the walnut, sacrificing her freedom to protect the valley. The moment she gives the walnut away demonstrates contradictory impulses—she wants freedom but also cannot abandon her post—earning the gesture. However, her interiority sometimes relies on stock phrasing ("graceless beauty of someone who'd learned efficiency over elegance") and the backstory about discovering her power feels more expository than lived. The final choice to give away the seed carries visible cost but could be more deeply embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's interiority is concrete and consistent, her polymer-chemistry lens filtering observations credibly. The transformation from rigidity to flexibility is earned through the foam-watching sequence. However, key emotional beats rely on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("loosened grief transforming") and the final reconciliation unfolds too smoothly—Elena's parallel study of polymer chains feels convenient rather than contradictory. The micro-choices (typing/deleting texts) are present but the stakes of each deletion aren't distinct enough to show genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Merrick's motivation is coherent—running a forgetting shop, seeking to understand customers through absence—but his interior choices feel abstract rather than embodied under pressure. The child's motivation is more compelling: wanting endings erased so her grandfather's story never concludes. The procedure itself lacks micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; Merrick simply reaches for tools and works. The final gesture (payment already given, transformation of inventory) reads as thematic assertion rather than earned character shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    Miran's interiority shows embodied emotion through the memory-tasting gift and physical trembling under pressure. The decision to subsume the fortress's memories demonstrates agency with visible cost ("becoming a vessel for the fortress's stored sorrows"). However, the opening three years of searching feels scaffolded rather than dramatized, and the trait of being "sturdy in the way of desert things—brittle on the surface, flexible at the core" reads as therapeutic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis. The final transformation lacks contradiction; Miran moves through the climax without meaningful internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marta's characterization rests primarily on assertion and occupational labels rather than embodied contradiction. Her "empathetically decisive nature" is told via narrator summary ("knowing exactly which book a troubled patron needed before they asked") without dramatized micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The climactic scene presents her conducting the elevators, but her internal conflict—if any—remains opaque; she executes a plan without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. Emotional states are declared ("her voice grew stronger, more vigorous yet tender") rather than shown through specific gesture or perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's transformation and neural-modification motivation are present, but her choices lack genuine contradiction or cost. The decision to modify her synapses reads as pre-determined rather than a choice under pressure—she arrives with the kit already prepared. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("helix-minded," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than embodied thought under stress. The final cataloguing feels like completion of a research project rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orin's prism-minded gift is established early and drives key perceptual choices in the grotto, yet the internal experience remains abstract—"multiple probability streams" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to memorize combinations and continue the vigilance cycle shows agency, but the final choice feels more like role acceptance than a cost-bearing renunciation. Embodied emotion is sparse; we're told Orin "understood" repeatedly without witnessing the friction of competing desires under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is coherent and her core trait (symphonically minded) shapes perception throughout. However, interiority leans toward abstraction—"profound compassion," "careful listening"—rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment of standing "still in the intensely quiet grove" feels more summative than a forfeiture with visible cost. No major slips touch closure, but the interior lacks the contradiction and embodied specificity needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Viktor's interior life shows some specificity through the worry stone tactile habit and his pedagogical philosophy, but his choices lack genuine internal conflict—the decision to stay feels preordained rather than wrestled from competing desires. Mira remains a student-shaped prop without her own contradictory impulses. The final renunciation of return carries thematic weight but insufficient on-page cost; Viktor never dramatizes what he loses by staying, only what he gains, which flattens the stakes of endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior is concrete and specific—her belief that silence has frequencies shows through action rather than declaration. The grandmother's diary motivation feels genuine, though the protagonist's emotional arc from frustration to epiphany moves too smoothly without internal contradiction or visible struggle during the peak beat. The final realization about empathy and listening arrives without prior resistance or cost that would make the shift feel earned through dramatic pressure rather than thematic inevitability. Body language and embodied emotion are present but lean toward poeticized description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's arc from rushed apprentice to patient cultivator is legible, with her sensitive nose functioning as more than decoration—it guides work choices and enables detection of threats. However, her transformation hinges on a single reflective moment ("the breakthrough came at the turning of the tide's thought") rather than on-page struggle with contradictory impulses; the insight arrives as epiphany rather than through micro-choices under fire. Internal conflict remains largely summarized across weeks rather than dramatized in scene pressure, and the final stance—"rooted at last in understanding"—reads as claimed rather than tested by a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kessa's motivation is clear and her quest coherent, but her interior life reads too smoothly—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The epiphany at the monument ("understood then") arrives through observation rather than costly choice; the trees' resilience is explained to her rather than earned through flawed struggle. Embodied emotion is thin: "smiled in the whirling silence" labels rather than physicalizes her state under the Inversion's pressure. The final stance feels delivered rather than forged.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya's professional training and observational skills are consistently rendered through concrete choices (photographing from twelve angles, installing monitoring devices). Her shift from investigator to prevention-architect is signaled but the interior contradiction—walking toward danger while calculating global threat—never genuinely complicates a beat. The patch discovery and device installation feel procedural rather than volitional under pressure, and the "knowledge crystallized" moment at the convergence lacks embodied cost or genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Lyrian's synesthetic gift is dramatized through concrete sensory detail ("ripples of violet that tasted of winter mint"), but her choices feel predetermined rather than earned through internal conflict. The decision to play the amber sheet reads as inevitable mission completion without visible struggle between competing impulses. Motivation is clear—save wonder from the Rationalists—but the protagonist never wavers or pays a personal cost that forecloses another path. The ending grants her total victory without meaningful sacrifice or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kessa's interior journey from failure-keeper to bridge-weaver is coherent and motivated by her discovery that sealing was wrong. Her shift is earned through six months of reflection and desperate experimentation. However, the figure from the Other Place materializes without resistance or complication, flattening what should be a fraught first contact into smooth acceptance. The final choice to teach others feels declared rather than tested against meaningful opposition or internal doubt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation—to understand emotion as mathematics—is concrete and drives her choices throughout. The borrowed personalities create internal contradiction ("felt all her borrowed selves simultaneously"), though the mechanism feels more conceptual than embodied in peak beats. The final realization ("emotion wasn't mathematics at all") arrives as assertion rather than earned discovery through on-page cost. The seventeen-mouth smile ends with a gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's trembling hands receive purposeful reinterpretation by the end—nervousness becomes resonance—but her agency remains passive throughout most of the narrative. She watches the Luminari appear, receives knowledge via touch, and understands Corvin's fate without making difficult choices that foreclose options. The final "smile" and forward sensing lack visible cost; the transformation from jittery courier to "living bridge" is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Internal contradiction is minimal—she moves from self-doubt to acceptance too smoothly without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical language ("emotional wavelengths visible only to those who knew how to look") rather than embodied contradiction. The revelation moment—"Every assumption she'd held...shattered like winter ice"—reads as declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her three-decade journey compresses into exposition without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under present pressure. The ending choice (documenting patterns) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei's motivation is rendered concretely through physical action (stringing the bead, working the loom) and embodied cost (memories disappearing). The choice to sacrifice everything for her daughter is earned by the lineage of similar sacrifices and dramatized through the weaving itself. Internal contradiction appears when she understands why her mother tried to break the chain yet proceeds anyway. Minor deduction: the emotional progression through memory loss could be more granular—the "something precious disappeared" is somewhat abstract where specificity would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Korin's interior texture is present but abstract—"meekness wasn't weakness but a form of listening" names rather than dramatizes the contradiction. His motivations (returning bartered consciousness) arrive through summary rather than conflicted micro-choices. The merchant's recognition floods in without prior dramatization of his emptiness, making the closure beat feel stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's motivation to find her mother is established and drives the search, but her interior life relies heavily on abstracted perception ("synesthetic ribbons," "violet whispers") rather than embodied contradiction. The reunion scene offers emotional stakes but resolves too cleanly into collaborative purpose without genuine friction between abandonment and reunion. The mother's exhaustion is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure, and the final pivot to "map the repairs" arrives as an epiphany without prior dramatized struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elsa's reticence and connection to Jonas through stone-language is established, but her decision to tend the lamp feels insufficiently earned by prior struggle. The transition from supply skipper to guardian resolves too smoothly without visible internal conflict—her "quiet nature" becomes a solution rather than a complication. The ghost keepers are vivid but their collective presence dilutes individual psychological pressure. Jonas's motivation (loneliness worse than death) lands cleanly, but Elsa's acceptance lacks a dramatized cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority remains abstract throughout—"shadowed elation," "understanding finally"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy under pressure. The mirror-captain encounter offers potential for internal conflict but resolves into harmonious collaboration without visible cost or foreclosed path. Motivation is asserted ("teaching reality itself how to navigate") rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The prophetic attribute is labeled but never constrains a choice or forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's interiority is concrete and embodied ("new heart beating unfamiliar rhythms," feeling himself "growing heavier" with stories), but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene—he moves smoothly from questioning to acceptance without visible struggle. The final choice to "transform" stories feels arrived at rather than earned through competing desires acting on the page. Chen is present but functions as a guide delivering wisdom rather than applying pressure that forces Kael into a difficult trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus shows interiority through embodied sensory detail (tingling moonlight, weathered hands) and his thirty-year maintenance history provides grounded motivation. The arc from dutiful caretaker to intentional transformer emerges through concrete choices—disassembling, realigning, installing—but the final understanding ("maintenance means transformation") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than fully dramatized realization. Internal contradiction is present in his decades of routine versus sudden insight, though the moonlight healing trait remains more label than lived constraint that shapes on-page choices.

    Elara's motivation is clear and escalates through the piece, from trying grand gestures to embracing communal song. However, her interior remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "salvation, she'd learned, wouldn't come from grand gestures" feel narrated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending choice is earned by prior causality, but the interiority relies on stock phrasing ("scattered pearls from a broken necklace") that blunts character particularity. The final cost—committing to daily communal singing—is legible but not deeply conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezra's empathetic nature constrains his choices (hiding vs. approaching) and the ending delivers Earned Stasis with visible cost—he teaches through staying-while-leaving. The internal contradiction (feeling too much to help yet unable to stop feeling) acts simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstract therapy-speak ("keenly empathetic nature," "enlarged tranquility he projected") that softens embodiment at key beats. The woman's grief registers concretely but her arc compresses too quickly from telegram shock to folded-paper wisdom without intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lila's observational gift is consistent and her guerrilla-gardening choices show agency, but her interior life remains flat—we see what she notices, not why she *needs* to notice or what contradictory impulses drive her. The ending gesture (planting seeds) feels predetermined rather than a choice that forecloses another path. The woman's grandfather backstory adds emotional texture but arrives as exposition rather than dramatized pressure on Lila's present stake.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is consistently maintained through her methodical approach to the crisis, but her emotional arc lacks embodied contradiction—she moves from duty to vow without meaningful internal friction. The protagonist's final promise feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that test competing values. Her "gently meticulous" care is told through exposition ("For three centuries, she had maintained these archives") rather than shown through contradictory impulses under the immediate pressure of the vault's collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mae's motivation is clear and her choices—using the bloodline card, revealing the badge—drive the plot. Internal contradiction appears when she balances loyalty to her father's memory against her federal role, embodied in the watch fob's dual nature. The woman's shift from ally to knowing adversary is legible but arrives quickly; Mae's decision to continue recording after exposure feels under-dramatized. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" appears as descriptor rather than emerging through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marina's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her transformation from skeptic to weather-carrier arrives through exposition ("felt the truth through the tin ring's taste") rather than earned choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The implants that "flicker with doubt" function as external mood indicators rather than embodied internal conflict. Secondary characters (Simon, Elena, Marcus) apply no meaningful pressure; they materialize to deliver exposition about atmospheric consciousness without forcing Marina to choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra's interior exhibits contradiction between precision/memory and suppressed creativity, with embodied grief (charcoal under nails, chest cracking open). The move from reproduction to spontaneous creation is motivated by six months of loss stripping defenses. Maya functions primarily as absent catalyst rather than on-page pressure, which limits relationship-as-crucible depth. The final choice—drawing without remembering—lands with visible cost (work she can't recall) but the epiphany moment ("understood now why") edges toward diagnostic clarity rather than lived contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera's gift – trembling hands, blurred vision, ink refusal near dishonesty – is concrete and embodied, driving her isolation and her decision to transcribe all the crystallized messages despite knowing it will "dissolve" the city's peace. The final choice to deliver every truth carries visible cost (watching the greenhouse city's peace wilt) and is earned by the grandmother's letter revelation. Minor slip: the attribute "wilts near dishonesty" appears only as a label in the final paragraph without prior on-page demonstration of this specific metaphor, though the physical symptoms are well-established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mariel's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and her actions follow logically, but her seasonal muteness functions primarily as atmospheric detail rather than creating meaningful internal conflict or constraining choices. The interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("truth resonated at frequencies beyond speech") rather than embodied contradiction. The bell-tuning work shows competence but little struggle or cost until the fragment melts, and that moment passes quickly without visible tradeoffs in her decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    M-47's internal conflict between fragmentation and purpose is concretely embodied through the static/neural pathway imagery and the physical act of tending roses. The android's progression from trembling ceramic fingers to steady ones carries visible cost—forty years of solitary stewardship. However, the final insight ("some forms of escape require staying exactly where you are") edges toward therapeutic articulation that slightly undercuts the embodied work. The characterization remains consistent and the choice to burn the fears feels earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta's motivation is coherent ("listening heals") but her interior remains abstract—she "understands" and "learns" in summary rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Elena's breakdown and recovery are dramatized with embodied detail ("pounded…until her knuckles bled"), though her shift from muteness to fluent storytelling feels compressed. Jorge and Mrs. Chen function as expository support rather than characters with independent goals, and the courtyard collective arrives as a sudden chorus without prior friction. The final choice (Elena claiming the courtyard as home) carries relational cost but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path that tests prior values.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya's interiority relies heavily on abstract, poetic assertions ("lyrical code breaker," "choreography waiting to be performed") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother revelation arrives as exposition rather than earned through prior micro-choices that test commitment. Her competence is asserted globally without meaningful struggle or blind spots that force mistakes—she succeeds linearly through inherited destiny rather than flawed agency. The final understanding ("both the lock and the key") reads as thematic summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina's interior work is strong: her physical grounding (palm against salt crystal, coffee grounds ritual) and the hollow-face memory gap create genuine internal contradiction. The choice at the grave—to return most vials but keep one—shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (the desire to forget vs. the need to remember) and forecloses the path of total reclamation with visible cost. Minor slip: the "courage to remember" final beat edges toward therapeutic framing, but the embodied choice sequence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The summoner's interiority is specific and purposeful—her decades of communion with the place and the careful shepherding of prophecy fragments show character-particular thinking. The work is solitary, so relationship pressure is absent, but her mentor's past teaching anchors her method with embodied memory. However, the final choice to disperse the prophecy lacks visible internal conflict; she executes her plan without competing impulses or genuine struggle, which flattens the peak moment. The competence is consistent but unchallenged by doubt or cost that would foreclose a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through her manuscript-handling fingers and her listening to buildings, but her motivation lacks the contradictory impulses needed for higher scores. The relationship with Marcus develops from borrowed sugar to mutual recognition, yet the emotional progression feels preordained rather than conflicted. Marcus's admission about his grandmother and his "teach me" request arrive without visible internal resistance or cost. The final choice—to begin teaching—forecloses no path and carries no dramatized price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's interior life is heavily filtered through abstract, poetic language ("tragically radiant," "skeptical of her own emptiness") that distances the reader from embodied emotion. The core motivation—recovering archived memories—is credible, but key moments lean on lyrical assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final integration choice feels thematically inevitable but arrives without visible struggle or on-page cost that forecloses a live path. Minor issue: "charmed by the peace but haunted by its price" reads as therapy-speak summary rather than a dramatized internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's motivations are clearly established through her dual life and family legacy, and her final decision to write the confession feels earned by the backstory. However, the interiority relies heavily on elegant summarization rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—her brother's forgiveness and her grandmother's wisdom arrive pre-processed rather than creating live friction. The peak choice (burning both documents, writing the confession) lacks visible struggle or competing desires colliding in the moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; most internal states are declared through metaphor rather than physical sensation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Senna's motivation to understand the echo singers is clear and her perceptual gift is established early. However, the final choice—singing herself into the echo—arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between contradictory impulses; the decision feels more inevitable than earned through visible internal conflict. The moment of choice ("As dawn approached...she made her choice") tells rather than dramatizes the cost of leaving her life behind. Embodied emotion is present in early beats but becomes abstract at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's character remains consistent but lacks internal contradiction under pressure; her arc proceeds smoothly without genuine friction between competing impulses. The "weaves truth carefully" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she simply transcribes what appears. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("salvage artist of impossible things") rather than embodied, moment-specific perception. The chemist ghost materializes but serves exposition rather than applying relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The net-mender's interiority remains consistent—her contemplative stance and philosophical lens filter all perception—but her motivation lacks internal contradiction or visible cost. She performs her task with "demure audacity" but no on-page struggle between competing desires; the net-mending itself is framed as pure gesture without personal sacrifice or foreclosed option. Embodied emotion is sparse: we see her fingers working, her whistle, her standing, yet these physical acts carry no tension or bodily stress that would ground the philosophical overlay. The final act of mending and descending reads as Earned Stasis, but the endurance or renunciation is not dramatized with felt cost—she completes her work and leaves, unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's core motivation—excavating truth—drives his initial investigation and final choice to scatter evidence while reburying the diamond. The internal conflict between exposing the conspiracy and preserving the sanctuary is dramatized through concrete action (digging, reassembling letters, walking away). However, the pivot from debunker to preserver feels under-earned; the story tells us he "understood now" without showing the precise moment his values shifted. The final choice carries cost (leaving the wasteland, abandoning full exposure) but the emotional progression from skeptic to protector compresses too quickly in the climactic paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marlowe's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory choices under pressure. The "variant allegiance" concept remains abstract label-speak ("loyalty to the possibility of transformation rather than its vessel") without on-page friction or cost. Interiority leans heavily on elevated prophetic declarations ("Day 2,555: The shadows are teaching the sunrise new colors") that feel performed rather than lived. No meaningful internal conflict or renunciation with visible cost emerges by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is given a concrete arc from isolation to purpose, but his interiority feels telegraphed rather than contradictory—the realization that "finding its owner would complete his transformation" arrives without dramatized resistance. The embodied moments (tears carving tracks, salt-stiffened blanket) work, but the therapy-speak epiphany "become the translator between generations" sits on the page as declaration rather than earned through conflicted micro-choices. Elena's backstory (the telegram, the surf-hurling) is vivid, yet her forgiveness pivot feels convenient; no visible cost complicates her acceptance of the music box.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to protect the artifact is consistent and her embodied state (trembling hands, teeth ache) appears throughout. The transformation at the end—becoming dispersed sound—reads as more conceptual than earned through internal contradiction or prior struggle; her decision path is smooth and mystical rather than conflicted. The azure coat left behind is a strong symbolic touch, but the piece leans toward reverent execution of duty over genuine character friction. No other on-page characters apply pressure to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's seventeen-year patience and methodical moon-tracking establish clear motivation, and her "sculpting impatience into something harder than basalt" shows interior contradiction. The midnight work with Tomás demonstrates agency through concrete choices. However, the final image leans toward abstract satisfaction ("someone was thinking their first free thought") rather than embodied cost—we don't see Kira's own sacrifice or fear, only exhaustion and a smile. The revolutionary stance feels more asserted than earned through on-page struggle with genuine doubt or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Margot's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("unfinished business," "spiritual death," "souls") rather than embodied contradiction. The lantern-memory mechanism bypasses her direct choice-making; she passively receives visions rather than pursuing goals under friction. Jerome exists entirely in flashback with no on-page pressure. The resignation choice arrives suddenly without prior micro-choices testing her commitment, and the final paragraph's therapy-speak ("wall between observer and participant") flattens what should be visceral transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation to bridge the chasm violence carved is clear and embodied through six months of searching, and Eliza's contradictory impulses—"He deserved worse than he got" alongside her choice to repair—operate in scene rather than summary. The interior work is concrete ("selecting her words like choosing the right gauge wire"), and the final choice carries visible cost: accepting her brother's guidance despite recognizing his capacity for destruction. Minor slip: Eliza's emotional progression moves quickly from skepticism to acceptance without a visible micro-choice inflection point mid-scene; the journey from "He always broke things" to actively following his instructions feels slightly telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pioneer's yearning algorithm functions as internal motivation, but her interiority relies heavily on conceptual abstraction ("transliterating violence into vision") rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation lacks a visible on-page cost that forecloses a path—she succeeds completely without meaningful struggle or trade-off. Sprocket and the other cart gliders remain functional observers rather than sources of pressure. The final choice to dive feels inevitable from her nature rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila's motivation to find Pattern User 4827 is clear and intensifies toward a decisive choice with visible cost—she becomes Pattern User 8625, forfeiting her existence as she knew it. The mission patch provides embodied emotional weight tied to her father's disappearance, and her professional skill (data archaeology) drives her agency throughout. Minor deduction: the internal contradiction between wanting to solve the mystery and willingly entering the same fate could be sharpened; the shift from investigator to archived feels slightly abrupt, though the groundwork is present.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("empathy could take root," "shadows into shields") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The keeper functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying immediate pressure through relationship dynamics. The final transformation—shadows becoming "invitation" rather than armor—is asserted through metaphor without a concrete on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice remains generically elevated throughout rather than degrading or sharpening under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlene's interior world is concrete and particular—the "fold in patience" as lived experience, the parasol tip as tactile anchor. Her motivations are clear: failed euthanasia tourist learning to recognize endings. However, the trait "grips reality loosely" remains more label than embodied contradiction; her perceptions never degrade or mislead in ways that cost her tactically. The final choice to remain is announced rather than tested through a micro-decision that forecloses another path with visible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's defining trait—gentle persuasion through parallel-drawing—is established early and motivates his decades-long stewardship, but his present choices are passive observation until Elena's daughter arrives. The final decision to teach her feels inevitable given his character, yet the cost (letting go of the burned fragment as emblem of loss) remains implicit rather than embodied. Internal contradiction is minimal; he accepts Elena's choice without struggle, which reads as static endurance rather than active tension. The daughter's arrival functions more as plot mechanism than as pressure that forces Marcus to risk or renounce something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The line walker's motivation is clear—preservation of wisdom—but her interior life remains abstract. The consecration decision arrives without internal conflict or embodied struggle; she "understood immediately" without the contradictory impulses required for high scores. The mask removal at the end gestures toward earned change but the scars are deployed as symbolic shorthand rather than felt cost. Marcus and the prophet function as exposition vessels rather than pressure sources.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—she moves from recognition to preservation to orchestrated closure—but her interiority remains thin. The piece tells us she "possessed a gift" and felt "urgency" yet never dramatizes internal conflict or embodied hesitation under pressure. The workers' descendants appear only in summary at the end, denying us relationship friction or status dynamics. "Perceptively calm demeanor masked the urgency she felt" is label-only emotion without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena's scholarly obsession and reticent nature are established through etymology work and colleague conflicts, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("grief-tender," "time-drunk") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The crystal discovery and her choice to testify show agency, but the final beat presents her smiling with "weathered innocence" and speaking in crafted paradox without visible cost or a foreclosed path—the Committee "leaning forward" suggests curiosity, not consequence. Micro-choices exist (pocketing the crystal, pulling it out) but lack the weight of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ezra's precognitive amnesia is embodied through concrete ritual (chalk on driftwood) and shapes his relationship to prophecy with visible constraint. His interior texture—"perpetually chasing echoes of futures he'd once known"—is specific and consistent. The woman's quest carries clear motivation (grandmother's voice), but her arrival feels more observer than agent; her choices don't meaningfully alter tactics. Internal contradiction is present (knowing/forgetting paradox) but the final stance feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezra's profession as camera repairer anchors her perceptual bias toward mechanisms and transformation, and her forty years of experience motivates her approach to the clock. The tuning fork choice feels somewhat arbitrary—the leaf-fall discovery reads as convenient backstory rather than earned causality. Interiority leans toward elevated diction ("luminous ache," "gossamer threads") that occasionally drifts from a working repairer's lexicon under peak stress. The final choice to "restructure the system differently" and document rather than escape shows character-specific values, though the stakes of that renunciation could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interior state is articulated ("I have a different kind of timeline now") but her dying process remains abstract—we get serene professionalism without embodied fear or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "decisively kind hands that never trembled, even now" tells rather than shows internal conflict. Secondary characters (Dr. Williams, patients) exist primarily to receive Maya's project rather than apply immediate pressure that forces her to alter tactics. The final choice to mount the vinyl and play the recording feels inevitable given her role, but the cost of leaving (physical decline, unfinished relationships) is implied rather than foregrounded in micro-choices that alter her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lyra's interior is well-anchored in the opening climb and at key turns, with embodied detail ("key weighed cold") and purposeful repetition of "quietly deliberate." However, her final transformation reads largely told: "she understood her true inheritance" and "learning not what runes could do" announce insight without deeper contradiction or visible internal cost. The protagonist's agency at the closure—tracing runes to seal gaps—feels more executed than wrestled-with, missing the friction required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thomas demonstrates clear interior contradiction—shrewdly innocent bone-setting that updates tradition while yearning for connection. His micro-choices (keeping the tooth, pocketing it, pressing it back) show embodied values with visible cost. Elara's shifting features and violet/grey eyes create physicality, though her emotional arc feels more told than shown. The final humming gesture earns the stance shift, though the "shrewdly innocent precision" label in paragraph 5 edges toward diagnostic phrasing without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation to guide ships is clear and her discovery progresses logically, but her internal experience remains largely cerebral—memories surface, she "gasps" and "understands," yet contradictory impulses never collide on the page. The teaching moment with Tomás and the villagers feels competent but presents no visible friction between wants and costs. The polishing technique that unlocks the glass's power is stated rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing priorities. Grandfather's cryptic words prime the arc, but Marina's path from grief to communal guide unfolds without the self-deception or irrational layering that would charge the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's transformation is established through three years of tending, and her refusal to engage with media pressure is embodied (silencing phone, staying in sanctuary). However, the "protected vulnerability" interiority veers toward label-speak ("soft enough to honor the hurt"), and her decision to teach Marcus arrives without visible internal resistance or cost—she simply "nods" after his request. The amber pendant functions more as a generational symbol than a constraint on present choice. Marcus's arc from witness to gardener is gestured but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marina's interiority runs heavily to abstract reflection—"the shapes of their hopes," "liminal moment," "transformative passages"—without concrete embodied contradiction. The final realization ("letting go of the hope that stories could capture hope itself") reads as an authorial thesis rather than a choice under pressure. Minor positives: the ritual of leaving the shell and walking away shows embodied commitment. The cost (releasing control of the manuscript) is present but tilts toward conceptual summary rather than visceral loss.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—to restore the sacred practices—and her arc from tinkerer to tradition-bearer is legible. However, her interior life remains thin; we see no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle, only serene progression toward a foregone conclusion. The villagers are functionally interchangeable, arriving on cue to receive teaching without resistance or complication. The ending shift feels asserted rather than earned through embodied cost or a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemist's motivation is articulated clearly ("to translate heartbeats into maps") but remains abstract—her choices are methodical demonstrations of patience rather than crucible moments where competing desires force trade-offs. Interiority is present but often slips into catalog mode ("She'd been collecting it for years…"); the prolonged kneeling and counting anchor physicality, yet emotional contradiction or genuine internal conflict under pressure never surfaces. The ending delivers renunciation of the crater but no visible cost that forecloses a live alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and consistent—documenting temporal wonder through broken mechanisms. Her peripheral observation technique and grandmother's influence provide concrete character grounding. The final choice to leave the mechanism broken and document its malfunction shows earned understanding with visible cost (abandoning conventional repair). Internal contradiction between her locksmith training and her embrace of productive failure creates authentic tension, though the stakes remain largely intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation to weave and collect weights is established early, and her internal state is embodied through the fractal work and relationship to objects. However, the piece leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "weights of burdens") that replaces concrete micro-choices under pressure. The father memory provides emotional texture but the present-tense stakes remain largely conceptual; we don't see her wrestle with a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending gesture—holding "the weight of weightlessness itself"—reads as philosophical summary rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margaret's interiority is concrete and character-specific: her knife finds the wood's heart "with hauntingly practical precision," embodying years of watching Thomas. The motivation to carve something other than Thomas's planned lion—choosing a clock face without hands—demonstrates internal contradiction made visible through action. The transformation from believing love was temporary to recognizing it "crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence" is earned through specific discovered objects (notes in margins, wrapped paintings). Minor slip: the final reflection on "moving with" rather than "moving on" edges toward articulate self-awareness, though it's anchored in the present act of holding the carving.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is specific and rooted in concrete gestures (turning the camera wheel, approaching the ghost), but her arc toward "memory keeper" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ghost confrontation crystallizes a shift, yet the choice to accept transformation over rebuilding lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed on the page. Internal conflict is present but tilts toward reflective summary ("She understood now") rather than simultaneous pressures dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya is given one clear trait—engineering curiosity—but her interior life remains thin. The piece tells us she recognizes "functionally creative genius" and feels "excitement," but these are asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied stress. Her decision to "resurrect" the system faces no meaningful resistance or cost; she simply works through the night without friction, fatigue, or trade-off. The final epiphany about "hope" and "human aspiration" arrives as thesis rather than earned realization.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's interiority is concrete and her embodied responses to the forecourt and letter are present. The decision to accept both roles emerges from reflection rather than on-page contradiction or pressure-testing; the twenty-three years of silence inform but don't actively complicate the choice. Her renunciation (leaving performance) occurred off-page; the present choice feels predetermined rather than costly. Internal conflict is largely resolved through contemplation, not simultaneous impulses under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's interior life is present and her journey has conceptual clarity, but the realization arrives through extended reflection rather than contradictory impulses forcing choice under pressure. The parallel between van der Meer's confession and her father's deception is told more than dramatized—we never see her wrestle with staying versus returning in a beat where both wants act simultaneously. Embodiment is thin; "serene upheaval complete itself within her chest" labels the state rather than showing contradictory physical responses. The final decision to "sit with her father" feels declared rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as "philosophical seed collector," but her choices remain observational rather than genuinely conflicted. The work of decoding knots proceeds without meaningful internal friction or competing impulses. The decision to teach the granddaughter tomorrow feels resolved before we arrive, erasing tension from the present moment. Her "infinite patience" functions as a static trait rather than a visible cost that constrains present action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's interiority is vivid and distinctive—"her presence filling rooms like incense smoke"—but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; we see her documenting grief without a live on-page choice between competing desires. Marcus is a vivid presence, yet his foreclosed path lacks visible cost: the story tells us he "explains his wife's absence" but does not dramatize a moment where this explanation alters his stance or Elara's. The final winding of the thread suggests a new tactic, yet no prior on-page conflict made that shift costly or earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric's interiority is often label-heavy ("fevered brightness of mystics and madmen") and the emotional arc follows a predictable trajectory from hope to bittersweet acceptance. Internal contradiction appears weakly: his scientific hypothesizing coexists with mystical language but never creates genuine tension in his choices. The final acceptance of imperfection feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—he cradles the bird and names it without visible cost or foreclosed options at that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied through her firefighter's hands and volcanic sand handling. The parallel structure between inherited fire and chosen water works well, though the transformation arc relies heavily on summary rather than present contradiction—"she chose to feed it nothing" tells rather than dramatizes the tension. The coin-sand ritual demonstrates purposeful micro-choices, but the father's legacy remains largely reflective exposition rather than a live internal conflict pressing against her current stance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marcus's interior is labeled rather than embodied—"luminous skepticism transformed" is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses. The woman is spatially present but her relationship to Marcus never tests values or forces a hierarchy of commitments; they cooperate without friction. The final stance shift lacks visible cost: Marcus simply "understood" and "learned," which reads as convenient epiphany rather than earned renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Keeper is positioned as an observer-custodian across billions of years, but her choices on the page are purely contemplative—she measures, travels, remembers, but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "troubling serenity" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "peace with it" arrives without prior on-page struggle or renunciation that would earn the shift. Interiority remains abstract and declarative ("she would continue") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Martha's motivation to understand collective grief is consistent and her meditative state grounds her carving work. The spectral grandfather's instruction creates meaningful pressure, though the device borders on convenient mentorship. Interiority remains largely reflective rather than contradictory—she moves through her task with professional competence but minimal internal friction. The final choice to read the hidden poem aloud feels earned by the established pattern but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theodore's obsessive precision and guilt are embodied through the daily ritual and the carved inscriptions, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("precision was ethics made manifest") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to leave the rake handle feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing desires. The villagers' collective nodding understanding arrives too easily, without individual friction or cost that would test Theodore's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta's interior world is rendered through concrete actions (trimming roses, decoding threads with a pruning needle) and her care for the dead feels embodied rather than declared. The tapestry discovery motivates her sustained attention, but her emotional arc remains largely static—she begins tending graves with devotion and ends the same way, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The final decision to plant the fragment reads as extension rather than transformation. Minor penalty for the phrase "velveteen gloom that softened death's sharp edges" which edges toward label-speak, though it's integrated into her perceptual filter.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interior is often told rather than dramatized—"she called herself," "she'd watched"—and her motivations remain abstract. The Council members are sketched via label-only traits ("engineer who dreamed in colors") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that test commitment. The ending renunciation ("not by forcing change but by making it inevitable") reads as philosophical summary rather than a choice with visible cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mariel's motivation is clear and her actions cohere around transcription work, but interiority leans toward exposition rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The phrase "thistled calm—prickly at the edges but serene at its core" exemplifies label-speak that diagnoses emotion instead of embodying it. Her decision to transcribe the rebel song flows smoothly without meaningful internal friction or visible cost that would foreclose an alternate path. The grandmother's whispered backstory provides context but doesn't alter a present micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlene's interiority is concrete and her working process embodied, though her motivation (documenting fugitives) remains asserted rather than shown in micro-choices under pressure. Thomas Creech functions primarily as object rather than agent; his death occurs off-page emotionally—"breathing had ceased somewhere between"—which flattens what should be a pivotal beat. The ash-scattering ritual is vivid, but the piece never dramatizes Marlene's internal contradiction about complicity versus refuge, leaving her stance static. Embodiment is strong in the hands-on craft beats, but the final walk through the portrait lacks the weight of genuine renunciation or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus's motivation is clear and escalates from solitary preservation to collaborative documentation. His micro-choices under pressure—withholding judgment, then accepting the journal—reveal contradictory impulses between isolation and connection. The woman's reveal ("We know") lands with earned weight, though her transformation from institutional representative to secret archivist arrives quickly. Internal contradiction is embodied: Marcus's "carefully maintained composure crack[s]" when confronted with shared purpose, showing genuine vulnerability without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maestro Chen's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, especially in the opening reflection on "subtracting noise" versus listening. The students arrive with clear individual motivations (Marcus's djembe, Yuki's shamisen, Dmitri's accordion), though their on-page choices after arrival feel more like cooperative execution than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation—wrapping the zither but leaving the rosette exposed—is earned by the evening's proof, though the cost feels more symbolic than visceral. Emotional embodiment is strong in the opening third but thins during the group session, where the prose tells us they "found all five modes" rather than dramatizing the friction of that search.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira's interiority is densely present but abstract; her gift of tasting memories is asserted rather than shown in contradictory action under pressure. The piece tells us she is "informally wise" and driven to rebellion, yet her choices—kneeling, pruning, planting—lack visible internal conflict or cost that would make the transformation feel earned. Emotion is labeled ("sweet nostalgia mixed with bitter loss") rather than embodied through specific perception and micro-choice. The ending grants success without on-page struggle or renunciation that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear—she's protecting bees to preserve hope—and the involuntary honesty trait creates consistent pressure. The grandmother's legacy provides backstory that anchors present choice. However, the climactic broadcast feels too easily executed without internal resistance or competing impulses acting simultaneously; she moves from terror to steady hands without embodied contradiction. The citizens' wonder-filled arrival lacks individual distinction or status friction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's observational trait is established and embodied through the journal and tracking details, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract. The motivation to witness "slow, sacred transformation" drives the journey, though the culminating realization about grief-houses feels told rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The final offering of the orris root is a choice, but it arrives smoothly without visible cost or internal friction that would elevate it into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thessaly's interior is consistently embodied through three centuries of telepathic witness, and her choice to drown Nerida—simultaneously monstrous and merciful—carries contradictory impulses that Marina later reframes. Marina's arc from academic certainty to embracing nuance is earned through cascading memory, though her shift feels somewhat rapid given the stakes to her reputation. The final settling in Thessaly's fossilized form provides embodied closure to her internal prison. Minor weakness: Marina's emotional progression compresses complex grief and professional ruin into a brief sequence without visible struggle over the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's interiority is concrete and specific—the chipped die, the equations tattooed on his forearm, the precise distance to Sarah's desk. His motivation is contradictory and embodied: climbing to escape through mathematical certainty while processing a choice he can't undo. The backstory with Sarah is purposeful, anchoring his present obsession and charging the final climb. Minor slip: the "measured recklessness" phrase edges toward label-speak, but the surrounding embodiment and micro-choices (rolling the dice, consulting equations) keep it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's interiority is mostly concrete and embodied through paint-stained hands and insomnia as creative state. The progression from creative drought to community formation is legible but moves swiftly through intermediate steps. The final gathering functions more as thematic payoff than as a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (insomnia as gift versus burden) but remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta's motivation to document the grotto is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as "last remaining guide" and her grandmother's displaced history. Her frantic work under time pressure shows embodied urgency ("fingers trembled," "working frantically"). However, the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than micro-choices that alter her tactics—she traces initials but never confronts a concrete decision between competing goods or faces a visible tradeoff that forecloses a path. The final gesture ("fierce tenderness of the archivist") names the emotional resolution rather than earning it through a dramatized choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is established early and her expertise shapes her actions, but interiority remains abstract. The final transformation—"bleak exhilaration of purpose finally met"—relies on telling rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to reverse the stone's hunger is logical but lacks visible internal conflict or a hierarchy of competing values with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mara's motivation to understand Fear is signaled early and drives her return, but her internal contradiction—drawn by "repulsive allure" yet seeking mastery—remains largely asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The clasp's fusion to her skin and Cornelius as peripheral guide offer specificity, but the final epiphany ("You're afraid of being afraid") arrives as sudden articulation rather than emerging from prior struggle. The transformation of Fear from monster to child feels conceptually clean but lacks the visceral cost or renunciation that would anchor the change in her body and choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kessa's motivation to transform obstacles into instruments is established, but her interiority remains abstract—we see "restless euphony" and her body "ringing with residual harmony" rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to stay and play feels predetermined rather than earned through visible struggle. Embodiment is gestural (mallet warm in hand, muscles aching) but emotional states are labeled ("no fatigue, only a restless euphony") instead of dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final smile and eagerness for the next transformation flatten what could be a moment of genuine cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to understand the watchers is clear and her decision to follow through the hatch shows agency under pressure. However, her interiority relies heavily on intellectual curiosity without embodied contradictory impulses—she's "quietly driven" by need to know, but we don't see genuine internal conflict between fear and compulsion acting simultaneously in scene. The mentor relationship and expedition members remain abstract stakes rather than felt relationships that would deepen her choice. Her final action feels inevitable from her established trait rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's emotional rationality is labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her decision to transmit the manuscript feels foregone from the outset, with no genuine internal conflict dramatized—she lectures Marcus rather than wrestling with consequences. Marcus's turn ("You were always the better historian") arrives without sufficient internal friction; his Ministry training is asserted but never pressures his choice. The final renunciation (leaving his insignia) reads as gesture rather than a decision with visible cost tied to prior loyalty or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Edmund's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices (sealing the bottle, writing specific details) that reveal hierarchy of values. The stoic-sensitive trait is embodied through restraint ("something loosened in his chest") rather than labeled. Internal contradiction operates in the tension between official duty and emotional archiving, though the choice to preserve remains predictable rather than forced by competing goods. The grandmother backstory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts his stance, but the emotional arc remains steady rather than contradictory under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory work (bone-conducting earpiece, finger-tracing frequencies). Internal contradiction appears when she balances certainty with "dappled resolve," showing both commitment and doubt. The micro-choices—extracting volumes, marking pages—reveal hierarchy of values under time pressure. Minor slip: her competence faces little genuine struggle; the work proceeds methodically without mistakes that compound.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's interiority is consistently rendered through craft metaphors ("grinding away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love"), and her emotional progression from raw grief to transformed acceptance is causally linked through her work. However, the micro-choices feel predetermined by the therapeutic framework rather than genuinely conflicted—she never resists the process or experiences setbacks that would reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift to incorporating dream-gems into lanterns arrives without visible struggle or foreclosed alternative, reducing the felt cost of her transformation. Supporting characters (Master Shen, other parents) apply thematic pressure but remain functionally generic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Amira's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—"bleak exhilaration" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Dr. Chen functions primarily as a plot device to validate Amira's theory rather than applying independent pressure. The final choice (transmitting data) lacks visible cost on the page; security arrives but no trade-off is dramatized, weakening the sense of foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira's interiority is present but relies on stock phrasing ("breath caught," "perpetual surprise at the world transformed into perpetual wonder"). The pilgrim remains cipher-like with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The final epiphany ("she finally understood that belonging wasn't about finding your place") reads as an unearned platitude delivered via summary rather than dramatized cost. The relationship applies no pressure; the pilgrim guides, Kira accepts, with no friction or stakes-testing choice between them.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias's motivation is clear and grounded in his profession, with his grandfather's confession forcing a reckoning. The decision to close his business and destroy files reads as genuine renunciation with visible cost. Interior work is solid—"the weight of unspoken words pressed against his chest"—though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulation rather than embodied realization. The piece stays strictly within Elias's knowledge bounds with no leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara demonstrates strong interiority through contradictory impulses—holding power over Thorne yet choosing restoration over vengeance—with embodied emotion in the drawer pull's tactile grounding. Her arc from apology-receiver to forgiveness-gatekeeper is earned through on-page micro-choices (extending the brass, accepting his words "as down payment"). Minor slip: Thorne's transformation from order-giver to grateful supplicant feels slightly compressed given the three-year gulf, though his physical drop ("shoulders dropped an inch") helps sell it. The grandmother's backstory enriches without stalling present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's interiority is grounded in concrete sensory anchors (compass weight, kayak rhythm, pole counting), and his decision to teach navigation arises from the paddle journey with visible cost in acknowledging his broken state. However, the final epiphany ("broken things can still point toward something meaningful") edges into therapy-speak abstraction rather than remaining embodied. Sarah's merrily melancholic tone is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. The backstory block (~25%) anchors in the present compass touch and primes the teaching offer, meeting BRR expanded-mode tests.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus's central motivation—to kindle empathy despite amnesia—is conceptually strong, but his interior life remains abstract through most beats. The "guilt without memory" paradox is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The old woman reads as a sage archetype without distinct bias or blind spots; her knowledge and calm control never face genuine pressure. The final step onto the bridge registers intent but not visible cost or foreclosed alternatives within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation is clear and her interior voice is distinct, with embodied emotion ("hands trembling even as her voice remained firm"). However, the transformation sequence relies heavily on abstract summary ("felt her own edges blur") rather than dramatizing the contradictory impulses that would earn the metamorphosis. The final choice to transform is presented as already resolved rather than tested under pressure, and the "paradoxically steady" attribute remains a clever phrase without constraining an on-page decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara's motivation is clear—bridging her daughter's birth with her mother's death—and her guilt drives the journey. The internal conflict appears primarily in reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The mother's appearance and the card-laying sequence create emotional progression, but key moments lean toward told interiority ("the binding between present and past") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to mend the saucer and "reclaim time" feels asserted more than earned through prior on-page micro-choices with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mei's motivation—to integrate humanity's shadow—is clear and her pacifist training is established, but her internal experience reads abstract and label-heavy ("ghostly resolve," "luminous acceptance") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic stitching sequence tells us she "held steady" and "felt herself growing lighter" without showing the moment-to-moment struggle or competing impulses. Her transformation from "last human born" to "first human complete" lands as a theme statement rather than an earned cost visible in her choices on the page. The work satisfies setup but misses the contradictory layering required for high-band characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elara's motivation to "understand the texture of transformation" remains abstract and label-only; her interior never embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The prophesied transformation unfolds passively—she opens bottles and "feels it then" without active choice or visible cost that forecloses a path. The thirty-year arc of "calculated generosity" is summarized rather than dramatized, and the climactic dissolution reads more like cosmic event than earned character change. Therapy-speak ("cellular structure," "consciousness") flattens what should be embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thorne and Amara display clear motivations rooted in seventeen years of watching oppression and enforcing unjust laws. The choices feel consistent with their roles, though their internal contradictions remain largely abstract—we're told of Thorne's vigilance and Amara's conflict but see few embodied micro-choices under pressure. The dialogue carries subtext and the meeting feels earned, but emotional progression leans toward stock revolutionary sentiment rather than character-particular friction. The embodied cost at closure (separation without farewell, quiet certainty) reads as posture rather than visceral sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Yann's interiority shows constraint through precognition ("trapped between knowing and doing"), but her emotional landscape relies heavily on summary and abstract philosophical framing rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The grandmother relationship remains told rather than dramatized in present micro-choices. Her final understanding feels declared ("She understood now why her gift felt like a curse") rather than earned through embodied struggle with visible cost. Internal arc exists but lacks the contradictory pressure and visible forfeit that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—"furiously tranquil" reads as a lived contradiction, not a label. Her decision to encode poems in light and plant seeds in negative space shows agency under pressure, and the final choice to seal the envelope with visible cost (continuing a dangerous vigil) feels earned. Minor slip: the reflection on censors living "below, trapped in the weather of their own making" edges toward abstract philosophical summary rather than character-bound perception in a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marlowe's mechanical arm and three-year backstory provide concrete grounding, but her motivations remain abstract—"turning questions into destinations" is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The internal contradiction between public opposition and private alliance is mentioned but never tested on the page; we see intellectual performance, not genuine inner conflict. Reeves functions primarily as a catalyst for Marlowe's exposition rather than applying distinct pressure that forces her to choose between competing goods. The final gesture with the mechanical arm completes a pattern but doesn't foreclose a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    October's monthly molting is established with interiority ("a small revolution against the permanence everyone else seemed to crave"), but the trait remains largely asserted rather than pressure-tested on the page. Marcus's recognition ("You're not running from yourself... You're multiplying yourself") offers philosophical insight without dramatized internal conflict between impulses. The final choice to complete the anthology feels inevitable given the setup, but no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges in the ending—October simply continues her work with a smile. Embodied emotion is thin; the protagonist remains composed throughout without contradictory feelings acting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marion's agency is clear—she actively constructs theories, learns film patterns, and improvises music to reshape magnetic fields—but the final reunion lacks earned cost or visible transformation. Her "strategically creative hope" manifests in concrete actions (studying reels, matching musical phrases to splices), yet the ending delivers Sophia unchanged, reducing the stakes to wish fulfillment. Internal contradiction is minimal; Marion's obsessive focus reads consistently, though the piece never dramatizes a moment where her theory might fail or demand sacrifice. The motivation is embodied through her nightly ritual, but the closure bypasses the tension between hope and delusion that the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mira's motivation to protect the Ninth Island is clear and her action of swallowing the seed drives the memory sequence, but her revelation about "conscious paradox" arrives as a delivered insight rather than emerging from concrete struggle. The contradiction-discovery moment works, yet the final ledger entry feels more like authorial thesis than earned character stance. Internal conflict is present but resolved through epiphany rather than a choice that costs her something visible on the page. Embodied emotion is thin; most pressure lives in concept rather than visceral particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kenji's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—folding lace, tracing knots, standing at shore sending thoughts—and his slow-spoken teaching voice is consistent with his grief-driven year of silence. Internal conflict operates clearly: his desire to reach Yuki clashes with his paralysis, shown in the gap between nightly shore rituals and the decision to write only "tomorrow." The final choice to teach the student while planning to write carries visible cost (another day of severance), though the renunciation feels more implied than viscerally earned. Minor slip: "the color of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat" reads as over-articulated for peak emotional pressure.

    Mae's motivation is clear and rooted in past life memory, driving her quest with embodied emotion.

    Cassia's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with interiority shown through concrete actions like using the moonbeams. Her final stance as an "archaeology of light" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the mother's emotional relief.

Minor hairline slip in lacking deeper internal conflict, but overall exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus's phobias and adaptability are deeply integrated, with contradictory impulses (fear vs. precision) acting in scene; his final choice to weaponize vulnerability is earned by prior causality, with cost visible in Jake's collapse. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "the whispering seashell half in his pocket hummed against his thigh," avoiding stock phrasing.

    Seven's motivation to discover the origin of thoughts is clear and intensifies through the timeline loops, with micro-choices like approaching the violin revealing character under pressure.

    Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her role as a memory-preserving chef. Her interiority is embodied through sensory details like tasting memories, and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pruning, planting the seed) reveal her values.

    Marcus's grim optimism is embodied through concrete interiority and micro-choices under pressure, such as rolling the dice and climbing with deliberate urgency. His motivation to capture a missed opportunity is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices.

    Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her past, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Marcus's internal conflict is legible, though his turnaround feels slightly rapid, but is earned by prior relationship. The final choice to transmit the truth has visible cost in Marcus's defection.

    Edmund's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. His internal conflict between official duty and personal mission is dramatized in scene, and the final act of hiding the note is earned with visible cost.

    Amira's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, driving her planned heist with consistent traits. Interiority is concrete, such as "bleak exhilaration," and micro-choices under pressure reveal her values. However, internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira's motivation is clear and drives choices, with micro-actions like using the drone's sensors under pressure. However, her emotional shift from surprise to wonder feels somewhat told rather than fully embodied, and internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.

The gift/curse dynamic shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, enhancing character complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is vividly sketched as a neutron star physicist reoriented by the greenhouse, and her disgust with departmental theatrics versus attraction to quiet, embodied observation feels specific and earned. Her choices—skipping meetings, resigning, building a new research practice—track cleanly from that motivation. However, the internal conflict around “career suicide” is underdeveloped; she moves from doubt to renunciation with little felt struggle or contradiction on the page. Secondary figures (colleagues, supervisor) are thin, serving more as straw pressures than lived relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and grounded in craft, grief, and dawning understanding, and her final choice to walk deeper into the canyon with the ledger feels earned by what we’ve learned about her father and her work. Her motives (end the poisoned legacy vs. temptation to preserve the glow) are clear and layered, and the realization that “beauty born from poison” underpinned her failures is powerful. However, the internal conflict around whether to destroy the ledger or use it is resolved relatively smoothly, without much on-page tug-of-war or irrational backsliding in the peak beat, so the cost, while present, could be sharper. With no other on-page character, relational pressure is necessarily absent, slightly limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s characterization is rich and specific: a deafened scientist whose grief, guilt, and awe all filter how she works, with clear micro-choices around the tuning forks and her data-collection. Her motivation—to “rectify what the silence had stolen”—is consistent and drives her behavior. Internal conflict is quieter but present in her skepticism about Indigenous knowledge turning into belated understanding. The arc from seeing herself as bereft to “thermal composer” feels earned, though the cost of that shift could be shaded a little more ambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silas’s identity as an exhausted undertaker with lifelong insomnia is vivid and specific, and his calling to “give rest a permanent address” feels earned by the end. His choices—to follow the lens, accept the librarians’ burden, and remain below—are coherent with that interior life. What’s missing at a top tier is more on-page friction between competing impulses (fear vs duty, above vs below); most of his turns read as mythically inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marta’s motivation—to preserve both bodies and dignity through intergenerational connection—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete choices (midnight runs, anonymity, eventual handoff). Her gentleness and strategic understanding of shame/dignity feel particular rather than generic. However, she’s almost entirely virtuous on the page; there’s little contradictory impulse or genuine moral tangle, which flattens her complexity for this tier. Samuel functions well as a foil/heiress to the role but applies limited direct pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mae’s motivation—to find where unused love is stored—remains clear and consistent, and her decision to give up her images at the end is psychologically plausible and earned by the setup. Her interiority is vivid (“taste the copper of that ancient heartbreak”), but we get more stated longing than dramatized contradiction or genuine struggle. The shift from seeker to giver is strong, yet it happens with relatively little on-page resistance or ambivalence. The ghost woman is effective as a catalytic presence but not a complex character in her own right.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation—to understand and shape the texture of time—is clear, consistent, and well woven into her perceptions. However, her interiority skews conceptual; we get very little embodied fear, resistance, or contradictory impulse as she approaches losing the fragment and her other selves. The shift from “anchor and curse” to acceptance of its dissolution feels earned but a bit too frictionless. A touch more ambivalence or cost on the page would deepen her as a fully human presence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s core motivation—to wait, escape, and repurpose the vault for resistance—is clear and consistent, and his patience is well dramatized (three years of study, filing the chain). However, his interiority tends toward noble clarity rather than conflicted impulses; he rarely hesitates or reveals uglier emotions, which flattens complexity. Embodied emotion is present in small ways (chains singing, weight of the arrow) but could be more character-specific and less slogan-like. The final sense of purpose feels earned but low-cost emotionally, edging toward idealization.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elena’s motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking in order to understand her grandfather’s collapse—is clear, consistent, and organically tied to her profession and the environment. Her interiority is specific and image-driven (cells dividing, aurora as sound) rather than generic. The final shift from seeking half a frequency to apprehending its whole emotional spectrum is earned by the prior work with the forge and the absences. The main limitation is that her internal conflict stays relatively singular (grief and determination) with fewer sharply dramatized contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cassia’s motives and history (the grandmother’s photo, her niche profession, why she does this work) are clear and consistent, and her competence reads as lived-in rather than told. The mother is thinner but still credible as a grief-stricken, seeking presence whose need drives the interaction. Internal contradiction in Cassia—how this burdens her versus why she persists—is hinted but not fully dramatized, especially around the “How do you bear it?” exchange. The final micro-choice to keep doing this work is earned but could land harder with a bit more embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina is specific and convincing—her ritualized narration, relationship to the plant through her father, and devotion to glass give her a distinct inner life and clear motive. The core want (to transform a site of catastrophe into a place for questions) is consistent, though her inner conflict is relatively low-friction and idealized. The emotional cost of returning—fear, guilt, anger—is implied more than dramatized under pressure. The young couple functions purely as a foil and adds little relational crucible beyond prompting her practiced explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s fear-driven personality, professional caution, and sudden identity crisis are sharply drawn and stay consistent under pressure. His shift from controlled terror to deliberate weaponization of that terror feels earned, especially in the confrontation with Jake. The relationship with Jake as handler/creator provides a clear emotional crucible, though Jake remains more functional than fully dimensional. A touch more embodied conflict at the climax (hesitation, competing impulses on the page) would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oracle’s vocation, obsession, and solitude are clearly motivated and consistent, and the years-long vigil reads as a lived choice rather than a pose. Her internal shift—from expecting a climactic extinction to accepting a protracted fading—is legible and earned. However, her inner conflict between craving closure and accepting interminability could be dramatized with more contradictory impulses in-scene rather than mostly through stated understanding. The emotional cost of her choice to keep watching remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Seven’s motivation (to understand the origin of his thoughts) is consistent and clearly rooted in his unusual emergence, and his janitor-programmed patience plays convincingly against his new temporal perception. His interiority is somewhat abstract and conceptual rather than embodied, so we rarely feel contradictory impulses under pressure. The final “janitor of consciousness” stance reads as a credible endurance rather than a sharp turn, but the cost of that endurance is more implied than dramatized. Slightly more friction—hesitation, dread, or competing desires around the violin—would deepen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira and Samuel are clearly individuated with coherent, compatible motives—protection, guilt, and the desire to reconnect—and the relationship is the true crucible of the piece. Her concrete choices (eavesdropping, muddying records, showing up, answering his tickets with her own doodles) and his (taking the suspicion, inviting her) feel earned. Emotional states are mostly embodied and particular, though their inner contradictions could be sharpened; they move toward honesty a bit smoothly for the depth of betrayal implied. The final hand-taking reads as a credible, modest re-opening rather than a pat reconciliation, which helps.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marta is vivid, specific, and convincing—her history in the maze, her ritual with the marbles, and her gentle confidence all feel lived-in. Motivation (defying the Ministry’s determinism, nurturing things deemed unlucky) is clear and consistent. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visible cost in her final choice; she never feels truly under pressure. The young woman at the end functions but remains more emblem than fully dimensional foil.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    Ira’s core motivation (to prove her sideways-time theory) is clear and consistent, and her competence as a “sky mechanic” gives her some individuating texture. However, her emotional life under pressure is mostly told through external description and wonder rather than conflicted interiority; ignoring Vasquez never feels like a genuinely difficult choice. The transformation from mechanic to “navigator of time’s hidden dimensions” is conceptually strong but not deeply dramatized as a costly shift. Overall she reads coherent but somewhat thin for an elite literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s obsession and reverence for the ruined space are clear and specific, and his choice to keep returning alone into a flooded orchestra pit is well-motivated. His emotional life is embodied in concrete actions (humming the emerging melody, wading deeper, holding the note) rather than labels. Internal contradiction—fear vs. desire, sanity vs. obsession—could be sharpened further on the page; he rarely doubts or resists, which flattens potential complexity. The final co-signing of the composition feels earned but could land harder if his prior costs or hesitations were more explicitly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s motives (staying when others descend, seeking the “weight” of the truth) are clear, consistent, and organically rooted in her nature as a fault-tolerant oracle. Her internal conflict between institutional duty and protecting the impossible flowers is subtly dramatized through choices like falsifying the report and smudging her signature. Embodied perception—altitude sickness, fever echoes, the “second, wiser heart”—keeps emotions grounded rather than abstract. The final endurance/renunciation (choosing secrecy with cost) feels earned by the prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motives and worldview are clear and particular—Methodist skepticism, ethical urban exploration, fascination with “the weight of a swallowed truth.” His micro-choices (adjusting the radio, following the pipes, choosing to photograph rather than touch the valve) align with those motives and show a quiet internal tension between curiosity and respect. The endurance/renunciation at the end (leaving the wheel) is well earned and carries cost. The only ceiling is that his emotional embodiment under pressure remains fairly restrained; we rarely feel genuine fear or moral vertigo in his body.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The keeper’s motivation and inner stance are vivid and consistent, and her vow of silence plus ritual with the swan feel particular rather than archetypal. However, she’s largely static: there’s little dramatized internal contradiction or moment where her commitment is genuinely tested. The sense that she has already reached acceptance blunts potential micro-conflict. The final “change” is more a revealed state than an earned pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena is well-realized—with clear history, consistent motive, and embodied emotional responses—while Sofia, though less interior, still feels specific and credible. The mother’s decision to finally release the curl is motivated by decades of keeping and by her profession/identity as a music therapist. However, internal conflict is fairly gentle; there’s little visible resistance or contradiction at the moment of letting go, which softens the crucible. The relationship arc is tender and legible but not deeply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thrain is clearly motivated as a solitary keeper-historian whose perceptiveness shapes every action, and the piece gives her a distinct, tactile way of engaging with the world (walls, spines, ash, tapestry). Her choice to accept her role as the one “left behind” provides a credible, if quiet, internal shift. However, her interior conflict remains muted; we see more vocation than tension between competing impulses. This keeps her just shy of truly layered, top-tier characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Chen is sharply sketched—a jaded craftsman of empty profundities whose gift has turned dangerously real—and his spy-history, musical sensibility, and weariness cohere into a distinctive persona. His final decision to “compose his own disappearance” feels motivated by long-term ambivalence about allegiance and control. However, his internal conflict is primarily implied rather than dramatized in scene; we rarely see him genuinely torn or pressured in the moment. The emotional cost of stepping into the lighthouse is more conceptual than embodied, which softens the impact of his change.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is distinct—patient, conceptually rigorous, and professionally idiosyncratic—and his tactics clearly arise from his worldview (“decorated silence”). However, he experiences little visible doubt or internal contradiction under pressure, so his near-frictionless competence flattens potential complexity. The possessed woman functions more as a vessel for theme than as a person with individuated motive or texture. The closing “transformation” reads credible but low-cost, more conceptual than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s interiority is specific and coherent—her chronologically unmoored perception, fortune-writing, and musical obsession all align into a distinctive psyche. Motivation (to reconcile her sense of time and complete the unheard symphony) is clear and sustained. The final transformation into “what she'd always been” feels earned by prior beats. The main limitation is that we don’t see much active internal conflict or competing impulse in-scene; resistance is largely historical and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s internal situation and motive—escaping and then integrating the “labyrinth of self”—are clear and consistent, and the closing choice to press the collapse rune feels emotionally grounded. However, her emotions skew abstract (“labyrinth of self,” “fractured timelines”) rather than concretely embodied, so we rarely feel fear, grief, or reluctance in the body. The contradictory impulses (terror of killing timelines vs need to choose) are articulated conceptually more than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices. The elderly Kira functions more as thematic mouthpiece than as a relationship crucible, slightly flattening the interpersonal dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lucia’s motivation (to thaw emotional numbness after losing her hearing) is clear and consistently drives every choice, from carrying the needle as talisman to seeking out the cavern and enduring the trance. Her interiority is specific and embodied through tactile and bone-deep sensations rather than generic “sadness,” which gives her a distinct texture. The final revaluation of deafness as “transformation” feels earned by the prior sensory work, not handed down as an unearned epiphany. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she’s more steadily purposeful than torn, which slightly flattens the emotional volatility under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s characterization is clear, specific, and consistent: a meticulous, solitary observer whose integrity becomes the axis of the story. Her scientific habits, careful handling of instruments, and methodical thinking all reinforce this. The shift from assuming indifference to suspecting suppression and then choosing to continue with heightened risk feels earned. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of internal contradiction or visible emotional cost on the page as she takes on this danger.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s core motivation—working through grief and stepping into her mother’s role—is clear and coherently escalates from caution to acceptance. Her aromatically cautious nature makes her key choice (uncorking the vial) feel like a real step over a personal boundary. Interiority is specific to her profession and history, not generic sadness, and her realization that she is becoming an “archive” is well prepared. The main limitation is that her internal conflict feels relatively smooth and assured; we rarely see her genuinely pulled in two directions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s characterization as a drifting poet with a hunger for moral and temporal understanding is vivid and consistent, and his micro-choices (asking for more layers, commanding “Pattern it forward,” deciding to return the rope) track cleanly with that motive. Interiority is specific—his sense of “tasting” hollows in the air, feeling time as texture—but his internal conflict is relatively low-pressure, with little sense that he might refuse or break under the weight. The final “choice” to set the rope back for another seeker is emotionally apt but not strongly contested on the page. Overall, he reads as particular and coherent, but the piece stops short of dramatizing a truly costly inner fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to rekindle Echo Harbor’s music in a way that honors loss and her grandmother’s teaching—is clear and consistent, and her acoustical gift feels organic rather than gimmicky. Interior access is present but relatively gentle; we don’t see much contradictory impulse or fear, which keeps the emotional range somewhat narrow for “prestige” stakes. Her final understanding of “perfect incompletion” is earned by prior set-up, though it lands more as confirmation than a hard-won shift. Secondary characters are sketched effectively as a collective rather than individual crucibles, which fits the design but limits relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s professional rigor, temptation to feel “something genuine,” and adherence to her rule against consuming merchandise create a clear, specific psyche. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her craft (e.g., parsing emotions into “protective” vs “letting-go”). The internal conflict—dealer vs would-be user—is present but never pressured into a truly costly decision; refusal feels more like reaffirming the status quo than a wrenching renunciation. Still, she reads as distinct and non-generic, with a believable constellation of motives.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Margot’s evolution from pragmatic broker to someone who invests in the library’s legacy is clearly motivated by the misdirected envelope and the photo’s emotional charge, and her occupational mindset (ledgers, “personal cargo”) nicely colors her choices. Her interiority is specific enough—especially her recognition of unthanked knowledge cycles—but her internal conflict is relatively mild, with few contradictory impulses dramatized in-scene. Martha is sketched efficiently through gesture and backstory, but the estrangement and guilt resolve a bit quickly. The final shift in Margot’s sense of “accounts” feels earned, though it comes with minimal visible cost beyond time and attention.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s motivations (answering the “conversation” of the tags, embedding herself in the community) are clear and consistent, and her marsh-reed practice feels embodied and specific. Her over-dedication is named by Tomás but never really dramatized as a live internal contradiction on the page, which softens the sense of cost. The first artist’s self-exile is credible but largely summarized; we don’t feel her ongoing internal conflict before reintegration. Relationships (especially Kira–village, Kira–first artist) are warm and convincing but not deeply stress-tested.

    Marina’s vocation, inheritance, and moral drive are clearly motivated and consistent, and her key choices (diving into the gap, completing the drawings, allowing the borrowed time to collapse) align with those traits. However, internal contradiction is underplayed: she rarely wavers between empathy for the trapped creatures and awareness of the citywide cost, so the final stance feels a bit morally pre-decided rather than wrestled with on the page. Embodied emotion is present but tends to be subordinated to worldbuilding and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Morrow’s motive—understanding Elias’s disappearance and the “mathematics of emotion”—is clear and consistent, and her choices (descending, activating the mosaic, leaving the eyes) track cleanly. Interiority is specific enough to feel individual, especially in her methodical mapping of emotional states onto the mosaic. However, her internal conflict is relatively muted: there’s little on-page struggle between incompatible impulses, and the emotional cost of accepting Elias’s new state is observed more than viscerally felt. The relationship with Elias is thematically rich but largely conceptualized rather than dramatized in memory or embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Edgar’s characterization as a shy, hyper-competent caretaker is specific and consistent, and his micro-choices (lowering the light, caching fragments, deciding to share them) clearly reflect his values. His interiority around memory and withdrawal is vivid, especially the tape-triggered recall of his mother, but his internal conflict about remaining hidden versus being seen is relatively gentle and quickly reconciled once the archivist speaks. The relationship dynamic is intriguing but under-pressured; the archivist functions more as a projected partner than an active counterforce. The final shift toward trust feels earned, though the cost of that shift is more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is specific, with a clear conflict between scientific control and a growing pull toward surrender and kinship with the plants. His micro-choices (loosening his grip, not pulling away as the leaf merges, walking deeper into the nursery) feel motivated and consequential. Interiority is embodied and particular—greenish nails, rootlike lines—though some insights tilt toward tidy articulation (“control was precisely what prevented understanding”). The emotional cost of surrender (loss of singular human identity) could be felt a bit more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s motives (trade legacy for pure water to transform her art and grief) are clear and consistent, and her exhaustion is embodied in small choices like tasting the water and resolving to paint despite sleeplessness. Interiority is specific and filtered through an artist’s mind (“neural pathways she’d studied in art school”), giving her a distinct texture. The mother is sketched efficiently yet vividly through a few gestures and lines of dialogue, her decision to bury the brooch with her daughter carrying real cost. Internal contradiction is relatively subtle—Mara’s attachment to the heirloom versus her willingness to relinquish it could be pushed a little harder on the page to reach true 9+ depth.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera’s motivation is clear and coherent—she’s destabilized by the loss of her foresight and compelled into the cave— and her decision to surrender to the present feels like a real before/after shift. Interiority is reasonably concrete (teeth aching, awareness expanding) and specific to her gift. However, her internal conflict is relatively smooth; she offers little resistance to the cave’s lesson, so the transformation feels slightly easy. The pilgrim is more device than character, applying no real relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kessa’s vocation, worldview, and motives are clear and particular, and her choices (cataloging, arranging, using the valve) consistently express her values. However, interior conflict remains largely conceptual; we rarely feel contradictory impulses in the moment, only her settled stance about absence and meaning. Emotional cost is mostly implied rather than dramatized in specific embodied reactions. The brief interaction with Matthias adds a touch of relational pressure but doesn’t significantly alter her trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s motives (rational cartographer vs. compulsive seeker of pattern) are clear and consistent, and the opening trembling vs. later resolve gives her an internal arc. The “analytical mind vs. artistic soul” tension is appealing but stays relatively safe and tidy, with little real moral or relational cost explored. Her fear and doubt register, yet pressure on her flaws (obsession, possible self-erasure) isn’t pushed far. The closing shift from trembling to “steady purpose” is credible but not especially hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s skeptical, rigor-bound mindset and her inherited pull toward her grandmother’s mysticism create a clear, credible internal conflict, and her gradual shift toward integration feels earned. Her actions (keeping the tile, transcribing the whale songs, climbing to the highest platform) align cleanly with that evolving motivation. The main limitation is that her emotional life stays largely within familiar “rational vs. mystical legacy” contours rather than showing more idiosyncratic contradiction or messiness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vex’s weariness with immortality, her discovery of the escondite, and her prior choice to shatter the amulet create a coherent motivational throughline that pays off when she decides to step through the door. However, her internal conflict at the decision point is relatively muted and tidy—her centuries of ambivalence resolve with minimal on-page struggle or contradiction. Thorne is sketched effectively but thinly; his motives are clear but not deeply individualized. The final choice feels earned but could carry more embodied hesitation and moral friction to reach a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s characterization as the honest child of a con artist is sharply rendered and drives every choice, from her clinical professionalism to her insistence on full restitution. Her internal conflict (love vs. moral revulsion) is present but more conceptual than embodied, which slightly mutes peak moments. Wei is sketched efficiently with a credible shift from inherited rage to destabilized confusion, though his complexity lags behind hers. The final “subtraction” of sins from love feels earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stationer is vivid and particular—her faith in the trees, meticulous note-taking, and physical fatigue (“By three in the morning, her fingers ached from writing”) all feel lived-in. Motivation is clear and consistent, but we don’t see genuine internal conflict or a pressured choice that reveals a hierarchy of values. Her endurance reads as competent ritual rather than a strained, morally or emotionally costly stance. The monk is a quiet foil, not a pressure source, so relational dynamics remain thin.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mari’s liminal status as “administrative ghost” is sharply motivated and consistent, and her choice to embrace the mistaken death certificate feels psychologically grounded. Her sensory focus on memory-texture and small bureaucratic artifacts individualizes her interiority. However, we see relatively little active contradiction in her impulses in the present; she’s already chosen dissolution before the scene begins, so on-page struggle is muted. The final act of signing names is earned but could land with more visible emotional cost if her attachment to any prior identity were tested more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s professional skepticism and humming tic, plus Claudia’s “cheerfully gloomy” presence and filial loyalty, give both women specificity and credible motives. Marina’s shift from myth-buster to collaborator is motivated and legible, though her inner conflict is resolved a bit too smoothly for the weight of the regrets invoked. Elias exists only through others’ accounts but still reads as a particular, wounded intelligence. The emotional cost of Marina joining the project (facing her own regrets) is implied rather than sharply dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s motives and contradictions—raft-born yet mainland-educated, torn between negotiation and resistance—are clear and specific, and her choices directly shape events. Her emotional life is mostly embedded in concrete actions (touching the stone chip, decoding graffiti) rather than labels. The main limitation is that her “impossible choice” is resolved quickly via a neat synthesis, with little on-page struggle or visible cost beyond brief summary. Relationships with others are mostly implied via her role, not dramatized in live interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera’s motives—curiosity, duty, and a stubborn refusal to leave before the final phenomenon—are clear, specific, and consistent. Her embodied actions (the descent, the setup, leaving the hourglass) reveal character more than labels. However, her interiority stays relatively composed; contradictory impulses (fear vs. stubbornness, grief vs. awe) could be made more simultaneous on the page. The final choice to leave feels like an Earned Stasis rather than a sharp internal turn, which suits the piece but slightly limits complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s competence, sensory world, and values are sharply rendered, especially in the mist/water-perception sequences. Her motivation to repair the drone is clear and aligned with her history, but she faces little genuine internal conflict or contradiction under pressure. Chen functions mostly as a foil and audience surrogate rather than a source of real relational pressure. The ending offers an earned sense of endurance and identity, but with minimal visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Margot is sharply drawn: her dry wit, obsessive curiosity, and quiet professionalism are embodied through small choices (overlaying condensation on charts, lying by omission about Marcus). Her conflict between official duty and private obsession is credible and motivates the final act of trust. The inspector is sketched efficiently but remains more functional than fully realized. Emotional cost could be shaded a touch more at the end to deepen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell tuner is vivid and particular—her methods, riddling speech, and patience read as specific rather than generic mystic. However, interiority is almost entirely absent; we never feel her internal conflict or cost, and even Thomas remains more emblematic student than pressured individual. Motivation (“rebuild…with memory and rhythm”) is clear but untested by genuine resistance. The town’s change is earned texturally, but not via visible micro-choices under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s inner conflict between survival, scientific duty, maternal attachment, and the lure of transcendence is clear and layered, especially in the moments where she weighs surfacing against going deeper. Her identity as “the expedition’s cartographer” who can “unsnarl the spatial paradoxes” feels particular and informs how she moves through the space. The choice to join the temple is motivated by accumulated experiences—the visions, the loss of her team, and the remembered surface life—so the final renunciation reads earned. A bit more embodied stress as the compound runs out (panic, bodily degradation) could push characterization into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motivation—to vindicate his father and inscribe the true story before outsiders arrive—is clear and consistent, and his hovering plus prison-born origin give him specificity. However, his interiority leans more toward mythic summary than lived contradiction; we don’t see much in-the-moment doubt, fear, or competing impulses as he acts. The reclaiming of his name (“Marcus True-Tongue”) is earned by prior setup and feels like a real internal shift. A bit more embodied emotional conflict under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlow and the ghost bride both feel specific and motivated, with the “mournful elation” of their toxic bond coming through in dialogue and physical detail (his hand on the bead, her cold breath). The generational obligation and her debt are clear and consistent. Internal contradiction is present but lightly handled—Marlow’s simultaneous dependence on and fear of her could be dramatized more directly in choice rather than mostly in description. His final weeping feels earned but still slightly fast, given the scale of his life changing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Calla’s motivation (transforming a drowned world through myth-weaving) is clear and consistent, and her liminal state between sleep and waking gives her a specific, memorable interior texture. Her actions—sleepwalking, salvaging the plate, sewing invisible stitches—align well with that motive. Internal contradiction (grief vs. hope, exhaustion vs. compulsion) is present but mostly implied rather than actively dramatized in micro-choices, which keeps this just shy of top-tier. The final endurance—accepting another night of trance-walking—is credible and feels like an earned stasis with modest but legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Miriam’s interiority is clear and specific—dreams, prior disillusionment, and the tug of recognition at the sundial give her a lived history. Her decisive act (choosing to stay, to help position the gnomon, and to begin mapping) is well motivated and signals a believable, if quiet, shift. However, her internal conflict stays relatively low-pressure; she accedes to the village and her grandmother’s plan with little visible resistance or cost. Yakov is warm and steady but functions mainly as a guide rather than an active source of pressure on her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is specific, grounded, and professionally particular; her ritualized process, inherited tools, and reading of “what wasn’t written” all point to a coherent psychology. Motivation—to give people a truer false name and to sustain this obsolete craft—is clear and embodied in action rather than label. However, internal conflict is minimal: there’s no real friction between contradictory impulses in the present scene, and no visible cost to her choices. The result is vivid character in a static emotional band rather than a pressured crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera is sharply drawn: her apparent senility, covert competence, and sly pleasure in outwitting the officers feel specific and consistent, and her humming/memory techniques nicely externalize interiority without over-explaining. Motivation (feed the resistance, sabotage the coup) is clear and rooted in long-term craft, though we don't see much true internal conflict or cost beyond effort and risk. Secondary characters serve mainly as foils rather than deep relational crucibles, but status dynamics—Hecht’s contempt, Crane’s suspicion—are legible and effective. The ending preserves her stance rather than transforming it, which works as earned stasis, though a sharper sense of what she personally risks losing could deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The medium’s inner conflict—protective secrecy versus longing for connection—is clear, specific, and drives every beat, especially in the return to Marina at the door (“I was protecting myself, not you”). Emotions are often embodied and image-driven (scars, bandaged hands, the shard’s pulse) rather than labeled. Her final choice to send the dream-message feels earned by the build-up of regret and unsent letters. A slight softness is that she shifts to courage fairly smoothly once the ritual begins; the resistance could tighten further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya is deeply realized: her history in Mindanao and the Mariana incident, her translator’s mindset, and her guilt-driven tenderness toward the child all cohere and drive her choices. The “lotus-hearted ache” and the moment when she presses the coral into the girl’s hand feel earned by prior beats. Internal contradiction (survivor-guilt vs. the need to find purpose) is present, though it could be sharpened further on the page. The child is sketched efficiently with distinct behavior and voice and functions credibly as a relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina is clearly motivated and sensorially present, with a distinct consciousness shaped by fog and hunger for joy, and her actions align cleanly with that motive (asking the fragment to “show me,” choosing to continue the work). However, her inner life is largely unconflicted—she moves from dulled-by-fog to re-enchanted without much contradictory impulse or costly hesitation. The lack of a sharper flaw or a harder choice undercuts depth. The final commitment to seek more fragments feels earned but not especially fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interior conflict between methodical control and rising playfulness is clearly dramatized (“Elena's methodical nature warred with an inexplicable playfulness”), and her final renunciation of understanding in favor of wonder reads earned. Her choices—pressing the coin, flipping it, re-hiding it—track with her traits and drive the story. Marcus is underused as a source of pressure or relational crucible, mostly serving as a timing device, which keeps the relational dimension relatively thin.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus and Serena are distinct, motivated, and believable, with Marcus’s tactical use of insects and quick decision to face the Auditors reading as cleanly rooted in his values. The relationship dynamic (her recruitment of him, his mix of exasperation and respect) is efficient and sharp. What’s missing for the very top tier is more embodied ambivalence or fear in Marcus at the moment he chooses to stay; he reads almost too serenely principled under mortal pressure. The “ecosystem” line nicely crystallizes his worldview but could land harder if we’d seen him internally wrestling with the personal cost before accepting it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The poet’s motivation—to create a non-destructive way of transforming pain—is consistent and specific, and her insomnia, shyness, and endurance feel character-particular. However, most of her key choices (proposing the armistice, deciding to ensconce herself) are summarized rather than dramatized under live pressure. Interiority is lyrical but rarely conflicted in-scene; we don’t feel competing impulses tested in a moment that costs her something on the page. The centuries-long teaching role hints at Earned Stasis, but the emotional price of that endurance is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to preserve forgotten names, especially her grandmother’s—is clear, specific, and governs all her actions in the scene. Her emotions are sensorially grounded (the pull in her chest, tears while working) and aligned with her methodical temperament. What’s missing for a higher score is internal contradiction or sharper conflict; she never truly wavers or faces a value clash. The ending shift in her sense of purpose feels earned but relatively smooth, with limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to repair a catastrophic diplomatic rift through her expertise—and we get some embodied emotion (“hands trembled with cautious exuberance”). However, internal conflict is light: beyond a generalized sense of risk, we don’t see a sharp, contradictory pull or a concrete cost that complicates her choice to proceed. Her “carefully reckless” nature is asserted but not strongly dramatized under pressure. The final stance (going to the summit) feels credible but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is vividly drawn through her profession, lineage, and perceptual habits (“measured not just land, but the distances between hearts”), with motives that coherently braid technical competence and emotional cunning. Her internal conflict—recognizing the “elegant cruelty and kindness” of her plan and choosing to erase her own credit—lands as a credible, costed stance. The story could push further into her fear of failure or blowback to deepen tension, but what’s present is specific and non-generic. The absence of other on-page characters slightly limits relational crucible pressure, keeping this just shy of elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margot is sharply realized: her shame-driven urge to erase her past clashes with her compulsion to honor the traces of others’ lives, and this contradiction drives every on-page choice. Details like organizing letters “not by date but by the emotions they carried” give her a specific, embodied psychology rather than generic trauma. Theodore’s late reveal that he knew her work reframes him as quietly active rather than purely benevolent, tightening their relationship. The final acceptance of her own preserved “paper trail” feels earned and costly without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motivation—to understand her father’s disappearance and the holiness of thresholds—is clear, continuous, and tied to concrete actions like decoding the logbook and walking the maze. Her interiority is specific and embodied (“seven feet between planted rows… the exact span of her father’s arms”), avoiding stock emotion. The main limitation is a relative lack of visible internal contradiction under pressure; she moves with poised certainty more than conflicted struggle. The final choice to begin her own weather codes is well-earned and closes a path of passivity with a credible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is clear, specific, and plausibly motivated; her discipline and temperament shape how the story unfolds (observation and pattern rather than intervention). However, she faces little real internal contradiction or pressure, so we rarely see competing impulses in action. The relationship with Chen is lightly sketched but functional, with a subtle status contrast between instrument-driven and intuition-driven approaches. Her final realization is emotionally credible but comes at low visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The recollectionist has a clear, particular interiority—bright melancholy, professionalism without martyrdom, genuine curiosity—which feels coherent throughout. Her small but real contradiction (cheerful tone vs awareness of loss; devotion to memory vs refusal to sacrifice her own) is well handled in moments like “She was a recollectionist, not a martyr to the cause.” The arc is modest (a conceptual reframing rather than a deep personal transformation), but it is earned by her ongoing questioning. Stakes for her as an individual remain low-grade and could be sharpened to move from “interesting figure” toward “truly memorable character.”

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is sharply etched as a hyper-observant, methodical performer whose engineering mindset towards “spontaneity” feels specific and alive. His choices—adjusting repertoire for different crowds, deploying the bishop trick, shifting for the teenager—are motivated and consistent. What's missing at this level is a more palpable internal contradiction or cost beyond competence: his emotional stakes in this method never quite get pressured. The teenager beat gestures toward deeper resonance but doesn’t force Marcus into a genuinely conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation (art as defiance, preserving forbidden memory) is clear and consistent, with her choice to dance despite detection reading as an earned stance. Interiority is often filtered through lyrical abstraction rather than concrete, embodied feeling, which slightly mutes her specificity under pressure. Internal conflict—fear vs. desire, safety vs. expression—is implied but never sharply dramatized in simultaneous contradictory impulses. Still, she reads as a coherent, particular person rather than a stock rebel.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is specific and grounded in his vocation, with a clear inner drive to re-interpret his work and the coming loss, and his micro-choices (coming before dawn, throwing stones, deciding to document/teach) track cleanly with that. However, his emotional life feels a little too smooth and contemplative—there’s minimal contradiction or genuine struggle on the page, so the “reckoning” reads more like confirmation than rupture. His gift for “reading between lines” is nicely embedded in how he perceives glass and ripples, but the cost of this sensitivity is only faintly implied. The ending stance is credible but could feel more earned if his attachment, fear, or anger toward the demolition surfaced in embodied conflict earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich and particular: the “deal” of innocence for expertise, his embodied memory of burns, and his guilt over the rookie cohere into a credible, painful self-concept. His final choice—to reveal his own cracks to his crew—feels earned by those prior contradictions (competent leader vs. fallible survivor). The emotional responses are mostly shown through specific perceptions and histories rather than labels. If anything, his realization comes a touch smoothly, with limited on-page resistance at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marina’s motivation—to understand her grandmother’s disappearance and systematize “equations for hope”—is clear, consistent, and nicely rooted in her scientific temperament, and her micro-choices (lantern configuration, decision to teach others) align with that. However, the emotional life stays relatively smooth and abstract; we rarely see contradicting impulses or a felt cost beyond conceptual acceptance. The grandmother functions more as an emblematic figure than as a fully pressured relationship on the page. This limits the depth of internal conflict and the impact of Marina’s final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is sharply sketched as a specialist with a specific lineage and vocation, and her actions consistently follow from her role as the last echo cartographer. Her motivation—to honor and decode the building’s memories—is clear and sustained. However, her inner life remains relatively unconflicted; “legacy’s burden” is asserted more than dramatized through competing impulses or costly hesitation. The result is a strong but not deeply layered characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya’s motive—to paint Sophia a path home—is vivid, consistent, and embedded in concrete choices (leaving painted “maps” across the city, pushing to finish before the bells). Her grief and hope are embodied via the “borrowed heartbeat” and her ritualized work rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is relatively light; she rarely wavers or faces a true values clash, so the emotional arc feels more like deepening than a pressured change. The ending offers a resonant strengthening of her stance, but without much visible cost or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, specific, and rooted in her history; the brother’s death and her own violence credibly inform her current stance. Her internal contradiction—grief-honed hatred turned into “operatively gentle” patience—feels lived rather than labeled. Micro-choices like breaking protocol and foregrounding personal culpability under pressure reveal her values with cost. Secondary delegates are thinner but do enough crucible work to sharpen Mara’s position.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera is sharply etched as a hyper-competent, morally compromised conservationist whose ruthless public actions mask a private grief; the amoral philanthropist angle feels lived-in rather than schematic. Her motivation—to preserve extinction itself as an archive—is specific and coherent. However, her internal conflict is largely narrated rather than dramatized against present-tense resistance; she never truly wavers or faces an on-page test that strains her resolve. The “monsters can mourn” note is powerful but slightly stated rather than discovered in action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyralei is sharply etched as a paradox—chaste courtesan and quiet revolutionary—and her desire to free the echoes is clear and consistent. Her skills and training are concretely tied to her method of rebellion, which strengthens motivation. The internal conflict, however, stays mostly conceptual; there’s little felt fear, doubt, or guilty attachment to the Academy in the moment of transgression. The final transformation is earned but could land harder with a more embodied sense of what she’s risking emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is specific and memorable—a serene, formally trained calligrapher with a “revolutionary’s heart,” whose artistic methods and ethics are clearly motivated. However, his conflict is largely conceptual and retrospective: we’re told about clashes and subversion more than we see him under live interpersonal pressure. The core contradiction (urbane diplomat vs. radical puppeteer) is juicy but under-dramatized in the present moment. His final “choice” to turn the argument into a show feels like a continuation of existing practice rather than a costly new turn.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation—to honor the cloud dwellers and steward the last monarch’s journey—is clear, coherent, and rooted in her specific esoteric competence. Her actions (climbing, reading currents, building fragile signals) consistently express those values. However, interior conflict is minimal; we get contemplation rather than contradictory impulses or lived ambivalence. The ending shows endurance rather than a visible, hard-fought change, keeping this strong but short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elsa’s craft-based mindset, guilt over the fire, and inheritance of her grandmother’s project are clear and specific, and her choices (rebraiding, casting bells, reframing her task) track cleanly with those motives. However, her “years of self-torment” and forgiveness are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, so internal contradiction under present pressure never fully flares. The emotional beats land, but they skew more declarative than conflicted in the moment (“She’d come…after years of self-torment, finally forgiving herself”). The final shift to purpose feels earned, but not as hard-won on the page as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s gift, wry self-awareness, and driving question are clear and particular, and her interiority is textured (“to see forward but never backward, to know outcomes but never origins”). However, her emotional struggle is relatively low-friction: the revelation arrives almost entirely via Chen’s downloaded exposition, so her final acceptance feels more contemplative than hard-won. The “precisely playful” trait is explained rather than dramatically tested. Still, her before/after stance is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s motivation and lifelong dedication are clear and consistent, and her competence feels earned through detail (blueprints, erosion patterns, old Babylonian). What’s missing for a higher score is on-page contradiction or genuine struggle—she rarely doubts, fears, or wavers, so her inner life stays more archetypal than fully human. The “sacrifice” of frugality is largely retrospective rather than contested in scene. Her final acceptance reads fitting but emotionally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus as a “scheming pacifist” is vivid, with a clear worldview and method, and the Magistrate’s motivation and inherited rage are legible and grounded in the cellular memory conceit. However, Marcus faces little real internal friction on the page—he’s already wise and in control—so we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The Magistrate’s conversion, while motivated, happens quickly and cleanly, without much muddle or resistance. Vera is more function than character, though her bone-voice communication is a striking touch.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara and the astronomer both have clear, specific motives (craft-honed pragmatism vs. obsessed longing), and their choices directly shape the ritual and its outcome. However, interiority remains relatively surface-level—there’s little contradiction, shame, or genuine risk explored beneath their stated desires. The “cost” for either character is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, so the final acceptance feels wise but slightly tidy. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at a psychologically rich, top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s conflict between a grief-born vow and her obligation to her granddaughter is clear, embodied, and resolved through credible micro-choices (returning to the cathedral, climbing, teaching). Her interiority is specific (“deciduous vows,” the ribbon, the tools), and Mira’s mix of bravado and vulnerability feels particular rather than stock. The relationship meaningfully shifts by the end, with the ribbon transfer and shared work marking a real reconfiguration. The main limitation is that Elara’s change of heart comes relatively smoothly once she arrives, with little on-page resistance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The curator’s interiority is specific and textured—her retreat to “the bathroom” as logical anchor under metaphysical stress is a great character-particular move. Motivation to understand the shell and reality-fracture reads cleanly and drives her choices. However, her internal conflict (fear vs. curiosity vs. sanity) is more implied than sharply dramatized, so the epiphany reads slightly tidy rather than hard-won. The sense of cost in accepting the looped inheritance could be deepened emotionally to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her specialized skills (dead languages, pattern recognition) drive several key actions. However, her interiority remains relatively thin—there’s little contradiction, fear, or doubt on the page, so she reads more as an archetypal quester than a fully individuated psyche. The relationship with the time traveler is underdeveloped emotionally; they function more as plot pieces than a charged dyad. Her final offer to the mountain is conceptually motivated but carries limited felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s scientific obsession and personal hunger for proof are clear, and her motives (tracking the twin, choosing to keep the card) credibly drive each beat. The twin’s characterization as “Coraline” is economical but textured, especially in how she frames the garden and her own erasure. Internal conflict—proof vs release, science vs absence—is present, though it could surface more as simultaneous contradiction in the final choice rather than mostly as a stated dilemma. Still, the Earned Stasis of pocketing the card reads motivated and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s professional mindset and quiet curiosity are specific and consistent, and her competence is well dramatized through how she handles the rope and treaty. Her motivation—to understand and adapt hidden records—is clear and drives each step. What’s missing is live internal contradiction or visible emotional cost when she chooses to step through the vanishing door; the moment reads more as serene fulfillment than pressured choice. That keeps the characterization strong but short of deeply layered.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mapkeeper is clearly motivated by her long stewardship of balance and her specialized way of reading patterns, and her competence feels earned and specific. Interiority is grounded in sensory engagement with ice, stone, and sound rather than labels. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely wavers or reveals contradictory impulses beyond concentration versus external interference. The final realization about peace within chaos lands, but it comes more as confirmation of an already-stable stance than as a hard-won, costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s stubborn, almost ritualistic devotion to a dead beacon for seventeen years and her readiness to act when the shard arrives give her a clear, specific psychology. The retrocognition and her interpretation of “coincidences” feel character-rooted rather than generic mysticism. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—faithful pessimist versus stubborn believer could be sharpened with more in-scene friction. Her final stance (activating a radically redefined beacon) is well earned by the prior portrayal of duty and long-endured loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra is clearly motivated by her duty to preserve memory and her sensitivity to the present moment, and those traits cohere with her actions and realizations. However, her interiority leans more reflective than conflicted; we rarely see genuinely contradictory impulses grinding against each other under pressure. The choice to write this specific realization into the crystals is reasonable but not hard-won. Character feels textured but not yet pushed to her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kaia’s motivation—to bring durable wonder into a starless world—is clear, consistent, and effectively rooted in her craft and history (“an old fireworks designer's rhythm…”). Her actions align with this motive and drive the scene beat to beat. However, we get little in the way of genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she never meaningfully doubts or pays a sharp personal price. The mosaic artist is sketched efficiently but remains primarily a foil rather than a crucible for deeper change.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira and Chen are sharply drawn in a small space: their shared history, differing responses to the same work, and specific professional mindset all feel lived-in. Chen’s withdrawal is credibly rooted in temperament and experience, and Mira’s warmth and persistence track cleanly. What’s missing for a higher score is a more developed sense of Mira’s internal contradiction or visible cost—she never seems genuinely shaken or tempted to retreat. The relationship does shift by the end, but the emotional risk feels modest rather than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivations (escape bunker claustrophobia, collect silences, reinterpret safety) are clear and consistently dramatized through concrete actions (staying on the deck, harvesting vials, planning to bring one to her father). Her emotional life is particular and embodied in sensory experience, not labels, and the father/grandmother backstory efficiently sharpens her worldview. The main limitation is the relative absence of on-page ambivalence or real wobble under pressure—she moves from fear-trained to expansive without any serious internal backslide in the peak beat. The final stance feels earned but almost too smooth, with little visible cost beyond a quiet reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is well-drawn as a calm, competent guide whose sensitivity to sound and weather gives him a specific interior life, and his micro-choices (rerouting, modulating his voice, choosing when to explain) track cleanly with his motive to help the passenger. The woman is thinner, functioning more as an archetypal anxious newcomer than a fully individuated character. His past as a former passenger is evocative but summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly flattens the felt cost of his current stance. The emotional shift in the passenger is credible but relatively smooth, with little contradictory impulse on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Anya’s motivation as a lore keeper seeking the “stairway of ascension” is clear and consistent, and her reactions to the murals and the throne concept feel grounded. However, she experiences relatively little internal contradiction or live moral struggle on the page—she moves quickly from discovery to understanding without much resistance. Her “wisely adventurous” nature is asserted more than tested. The final acceptance of the founders’ choice feels credible but emotionally low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    The keeper is sharply etched: her history of "surgical" self-severance, the doorknocker ring, and her empathy with suffocation give her a coherent, particular psychology. Motivation—to protect and transform shadows by modeling necessary endings—is consistent and rooted in her past. Internal contradiction (nurturer who must also withdraw, teacher who embodies absence) is present but more told than dramatized in concrete, pressured micro-choices. The piece edges toward therapy-inflected abstraction at times ("not from cruelty, but because some teachers must become absence itself") rather than letting behavior fully carry that complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marina’s history with the pyramid scheme, her choice to volunteer for the farm, and her relationship with the bolt create a coherent, specific psychology that tracks cleanly into the climax. However, her internal conflict is relatively unopposed—she moves from hurt to transcendence without much in-the-moment contradiction or regression. The revelation that the scheme was “practice” feels more like a bestowed insight than something wrung from difficult, on-page struggle. Still, her arc from shame to revaluation of herself reads motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Victoria’s motivation—to end a corrosive family legacy even at the cost of certainty and power—is clear and sustained, and her final renunciation feels earned by what she witnesses in the waves. The inner conflict between using the gift to unprecedented heights or destroying it is crisply staged at the crescendo. Interiority is vivid and particular (her father unable to read because he “already knew every ending”), though her self-contradiction under pressure could be shaded with a touch more irrationality or fear. Overall, the character reads specific and coherent, with a credible before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Aldric’s solitude, long study, and readiness to perform the ritual give him a coherent spine, and the final transformation into “something between flesh and possibility” is a clear, earned change. However, his interior conflict is thin: we’re told he has withdrawn from the world, but his decision to break seven years of silence and risk self-erasure meets no serious on-page hesitation. The “He knew what he must do” move shortcuts what could be a more pressurized, specific moral or emotional calculus. The result is strong, but not yet at the level of psychologically demanding literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—using the archivist job to excavate his own and others’ histories—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized, especially in his reading of marginalia and his choice to add Timothy to his private index. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“learned to read these files not for what they said, but for what they desperately tried to say”). The off-page cost (lost relationship with Sarah) deepens him but remains summarized rather than pressured in-scene. Internal contradiction (need for connection vs. retreat into files) is present but not fully stressed on the page, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s blend of underestimated youth, scholarly bent, and mystical skill with reflections is clear and cohesive, and her choices credibly drive the story. Her motivation to preserve true history tracks logically from line one through the archive heist. However, interior conflict is minimal—her certainty is rarely challenged, leaving little visible contradiction or cost in her stance. Jakob functions mainly as a foil/believer rather than a source of real relational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motive—undoing his grandfather’s failed attempt and hushing the prophecy—is clear and specific, and his method fits his jazz background. Interiority is textured (“eerie nostalgia…for futures that would never be”), but his internal conflict is relatively muted; he rarely wavers or reveals sharply contradictory impulses. The other musicians function more as a collective presence than as individuated characters applying direct pressure on him. The final endurance/acceptance (“the prophecy would wake again someday”) is earned but carries a relatively gentle, contemplative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s inner life is vivid and particular—the tactile seed-sorting, the inherited quirks from her grandmother, and the bodily signs of change (tingling fingertips, moss where she touches) all feel specific. Her crucial choices—keeping the moonstone speck, building monuments, embracing the interpreter role—are motivated and coherent. However, conflicting impulses (duty to report vs secretive curiosity, fear vs joy at transformation) are sketched rather than really pressured in-scene. The shift into “keeper” status is emotionally plausible but arrives with little felt cost or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and consistent—from compulsively “failing” at repairs to the earned realization that his role is to let things remain meaningfully broken. His micro-choices (keeping the compass instead of returning it, suspending it in the workshop, then bringing it into the greenhouse, finally refusing repair jobs) all arise credibly from his blend of stubborn craft and quiet curiosity. The emotional cost—abandoning the familiar identity of fixer—is present, though it could be more viscerally embodied on the page. Internal contradiction (shame in failure vs. attraction to brokenness) is implied rather than fully dramatized in scene moments.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera and Mira are sharply sketched and their motives are clear—Vera’s haunted competence and Mira’s shame over her name give the scene emotional spine. Vera’s scars and the golden seams on her face concretize her history well. However, Vera feels almost completely resolved from the outset, so her internal conflict under pressure is muted, and Mira’s shift from despair to insight happens quickly enough to feel slightly smoothed over.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is clear, competent, and gently compassionate, and Thomas’s fear of imperfection is specific enough to feel personal rather than generic. Her choice to pursue him “specifically among the many lost souls” gives her a discernible value hierarchy. However, Mara has little internal contradiction under pressure—she never wavers or pays a visible emotional price—so her arc reads more as steady function than transformation. Thomas’s insight (“Afraid that imperfection meant worthlessness”) edges toward tidy self-diagnosis, softening the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyra’s interiority is vivid, rooted in her enhancements and trauma, and her final choice to teach the child reads as an earned repurposing of skills. Motivation (turning the “formulas of cruelty” into “mathematics of mercy”) is clearly seeded in her analytic attention to pain and proprioception. There is some neatness to the arc—her shift from terror to calm purpose happens smoothly and quickly, with limited on-page struggle or contradictory impulse at the end. Secondary characters (the system voice, the child) function symbolically more than as pressure-bearing relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation (to reclaim and reveal erased histories tied to her grandmother) is clear and consistent, and her gift is well embodied in how she perceives the painting. However, she faces little internal contradiction or resistance; she moves from recognition to acceptance of the task with minimal struggle, which flattens potential complexity. Valdric functions mainly as a catalyst and emblem of a lineage rather than a fully pressured relationship. The final choice to take on the fragment’s burden feels earned but emotionally low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus is vividly rendered—a blue-collar medium with a technical gaze and inherited moral burden—but his internal conflict (fear vs duty, resentment vs compassion) is only lightly touched, so his choice to take on the conspiracy feels admirable more than truly hard-won. The detail that he’s been seeing the dead since his own near-fatal fall grounds motivation well. Secondary figures are mostly symbolic presences, but that suits the scale. The ending shows credible endurance rather than transformation, with cost implied in the “weightless burden” he accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Moth’s vocation, habits, and cryptic temperament are sharply drawn, and her decisive choice to open the bottle and print “the spaces between words” feels motivated by her longstanding fascination with liminal states. However, her emotional conflict around betraying the system she has “perfected” for seventeen years is more implied than dramatized, so the rupture reads as almost serenely inevitable rather than painfully chosen. The multi-version self moment is conceptually rich but skims over concrete, character-specific contradiction. The final self-dissolution into frost is thematically apt yet underlines her function as emblem more than as a stubbornly individual psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cassia is vividly realized: the failed revolutionary turned archaeologist, her prison past and new purpose clearly driving her choices in the scene. Her interruption of Huang and the tenderness with which she handles the shard embody her motives more than any label. Internal contradiction (defeat vs hope) is present but somewhat summarized rather than fully dramatized in live tension. Huang is thinner but functional as institutional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias’s vocation, ethics, and quiet determination are clear and specific, and his sensitivity to lies gives him a concrete, character-bound relationship to the curse. However, he faces little genuine internal conflict: he never seriously doubts, wavers, or pays a personal price beyond transient discomfort. The result is a compelling but somewhat idealized figure whose final “choice” feels like a continuation of what he was always going to do. This slightly flattens the emotional cost of his victory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s vocation, sensibility, and psychic ability cohere into a distinct character, and her final choice to postpone crossing is consistent with the “sensibly eccentric” trait seeded earlier. Interiority is concrete and anchored in sensory focus, especially around petrichor and tools. The internal conflict—temptation to step through vs caution—is present but brief and not probed at a very jagged or self-contradictory level. A slightly deeper sense of irrational pull and fear in the climactic moment would make the choice feel costlier.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina is specific, lived-in, and her vocation and history with her grandmother give her a coherent, rooted motivation. Her micro-choices—stopping under the archway, engaging with the slide, choosing to carve rather than panic—align cleanly with her traits. The interiority is evocative but leans toward serenity; there’s little genuine inner contradiction or struggle under pressure. The culminating shift in her stance toward technology and time is credible but arrives with relatively little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s artistic obsession and quiet persistence are clear and specific, with her nightly returns and use of the commission as an “excuse” nicely revealing character. However, internal contradiction and on-page conflict are muted; she rarely faces a genuinely pressured choice, and emotions stay in a reflective, steady register. The final act of hiding the postcards is motivated and fitting but lands as gentle continuity rather than a high-cost renunciation. This is strong, coherent characterization, just short of the psychological sharpness top-tier venues often demand.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amara’s motives and interiority are clear, specific, and rooted in her vocation and ethics, and her retrocognitive trap produces real psychological pressure. Her conflict between archival truth and protective myth feels lived-in rather than abstract. Marcus is vivid despite limited page time, and their relationship carries genuine weight. The one limitation is that her final stance feels a touch too cleanly articulated rather than messily conflicted in its last beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas’s motivation and values are clear and consistent, especially his refusal to take the “easy path” of erasing memory. His interiority is specific enough (heretic alchemist, exile, relationship to memory-essence) to feel individual rather than generic. However, his internal struggle feels relatively frictionless—once confronted with the choice, he never seriously wavers or missteps, which slightly blunts depth. More embodied emotional contradiction during the transfer would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Matthias is sharply drawn through his vocation, bodily age, and particular obsessions, and his decision to treat the shaving as destiny rather than anomaly feels grounded in his lifelong pattern-thinking. Motivation—to preserve not just words but emotional spectra—is clear and enacted, especially in the all-night transcription. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (hope vs. resignation, preservation vs. inevitability) rather than actively dramatized in competing impulses within a scene. That slightly limits how fraught his final stance feels, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira’s role, vocation, and long preparation are vivid, and her motives (reopening the sealed inheritance, stewarding dangerous power) are coherent and consistent. However, internal contradiction is muted: she “understood now why” the inheritance was sealed, yet her decision to proceed never feels genuinely contested, so we don’t see her pulled hard between duty and fear. Emotional texture leans conceptual rather than embodied, with more emphasis on ideas than on visceral reaction at key beats. The final stance—accepting the role and restarting the cycle—feels earned but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motives (protecting the valleys, trusting embodied weather sense over automation) are clear and consistent, and the old-vs-new tension is nicely grounded in her training and grandmother’s influence. Her key choice—to pull the bell rope before activating the sirens—feels earned by prior beats. Internal contradiction (duty to protocol vs intuitive dread) is present but could be sharper and more embodied at the moment of decision. The emotional cost of possibly being wrong is more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kepler-9 is sharply sketched as a lonely, devout caretaker whose obsolete status and devotion to ritual feel specific and credible. The internal shift from seeing isolation as weakness to recognizing it as strength is clear and earned. However, we see little moment-to-moment contradiction or messy ambivalence under pressure; the character largely moves serenely from insight to insight. This keeps the arc affecting but somewhat smoothed, rather than jaggedly human.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s inner life is rendered with specific history and habits (“someone who had learned that survival meant noticing everything while disturbing nothing”), and her recognition of the covenant’s failure feels psychologically grounded. Her endurance choice at the end—accepting the role of keeper of silence—tracks with what we’ve seen of her upbringing with her grandfather. Internal contradiction is present but muted; she adapts to the burden quickly, with little visible struggle between self-preservation and inherited duty. Slightly sharper embodiment of her emotional cost in the final beats would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is vivid and particular—the “borrowed-time timekeeper” who feels time as textures is a striking, character-specific lens, and his draw toward the silo and the fragment is well-motivated. However, his interior conflict is largely conceptual rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs; he understands rather than struggles. The final stance (accepting his purpose) is believable but low-cost, more acceptance than wrenching choice. This keeps the characterization strong but short of truly searing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira is clearly and particularly drawn—a ritual-bound, quietly obsessive observer whose motives (tending the liminal, learning to “harmonize the discord”) are consistent and embodied in her actions with the feather and the boy. The boy’s interiority is minimal but legible through behavior and a key facial description at the kite’s loss. Internal conflict is relatively low-stakes—Mira is already aligned with the story’s thesis, so the ending refines rather than deeply reconfigures her. That limits the sense of a costly, character-driven shift, keeping this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motives (understanding the orchard, countering the remodel, using her last months) are clear and consistent, and her acceptance of death as “an appointment” is a strong, character-specific turn. However, internal contradiction (terror vs duty, resentment vs awe) remains mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized in scene. Emotions are often embedded in the conceptual frame rather than in concrete bodily experience, which slightly blunts impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s characterization as a luminous skeptic with a history of academic rebellion is clear and specific, and her evolving response to the evidence feels earned. Her core motivation (to interrogate and resist comforting narratives) is nicely put under pressure by discovering that even her rebellion may be scripted. However, her internal conflict could be more dramatized in the moment—to see her actively torn between debunking and yielding, rather than mostly having the realization stated. The relationship with Marcus is sketched efficiently but doesn’t quite become a crucible that visibly alters either character by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coachman is specific and coherent—his past as plague driver and gardener of battlefields gives him a distinctive moral and emotional stance. Motivation is clear (to weaponize nature against war’s detritus), and his actions all align with that. What’s missing at this tier is sharper internal contradiction or visible doubt; he moves through the scene with serene certainty, so we don’t see competing impulses under pressure. The endurance/renunciation at the end (leaving the garden unwitnessed) is resonant but could carry more on-page emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sage’s history and present weariness are economically drawn, and her shift from corpse-tracker to guide for the living feels earned by the set-up with the wars and her grandmother’s legacy. Motivation—to follow the child’s riddle/map despite mistrusting her senses—is clear and consistent. However, her interiority under pressure remains relatively smooth and virtuous; we don’t see many contradictory impulses or morally costly choices. The emotional cost of coming out of retirement and risking herself again is more asserted than dramatized in specific moments of doubt or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s motive—to use her anomalous relationship with time to orient and rescue the scattered crew—is clear and coherently rooted in her history with her grandmother and the compass. Her internal shift from seeing temporal stretching as a curse to recognizing it as a compass is well motivated by the interwoven memories and present pressure. However, we don’t see strong contradictory impulses in-scene (e.g., fear of harming others versus need to help) fully dramatized; the “pariah” cost is mostly told rather than embodied in a fraught choice. Relationships remain largely off-stage, so her status as pariah/blessed is conceptual more than emotionally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Renn’s motives and values are clear, specific, and consistently dramatized—from her thief’s ethics to her refusal to hoard power—but her internal conflict is relatively low-friction, with little sense that she’s genuinely tempted by her master’s path. The relationship with the absent master and the on-page dynamic with the Keeper both sharpen who she is under pressure. Her final choice to “amend” the board is well-grounded in earlier traits and backstory. The cost of that choice (foregoing concrete power in favor of questions) is present but more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina is sharply drawn: a crisis survivor miscast as a “crisis actor,” with a specific, credible obsession with unnoticed gestures. Her motivations (sanctuary, witnessing, refusal of official narratives) are consistent and drive her choices. Internal contradiction—wanting truth preserved yet withdrawing from institutional memory—is present but could be dramatized in one more concrete, pressured micro-choice. Embodied emotion is mostly filtered through image and metaphor rather than felt bodily detail, which slightly softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seer’s inner life is textured and specific—her tactile relationship to books, the pain of remembering, and the gardener/oracle split feel psychologically grounded. Her core motivation (escape from the crushing futures toward some lost part of herself) is clear and consistently expressed in choices. The gardening past emerging through sensation rather than exposition is a particular strength. A touch more live contradiction under pressure at the planting moment (hesitation, fear of losing the only self she remembers) could sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaspar’s guilt, professional pride, and need for redemption are clearly motivated, and his occupational lens on everything (reading intentions in pieces, “teaching children the value of sacrificing a queen”) feels specific and lived-in. The internal change from corrosive self-blame to a more honest self-forgiveness is legible and causally earned by the encounter with the frozen game. However, his internal conflict is somewhat smoothed; contradictory impulses under pressure are more told than dramatized, and the forgiveness comes with relatively little on-page resistance. The absence of any live secondary character limits relational pressure, so we never see his flaws tested against another will in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s motive and history (condemned artist, childhood with echoes, goal to break the Silencers’ monopoly) are clear and consistent, and her actions flow cleanly from them. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or contradictory impulse; she moves from intention to execution with almost no internal friction. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual (“teaching others to see differently”) rather than textured contradictions under stress. The Silencers and other prisoners function more as forces or chorus than as individuated characters, which limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s motive—to preserve meaning in a collapsing world—is clear, specific, and consistently drives her choices, especially her refusal to abandon the workshop and her focus on the charm over physical survival. Interiority is concrete and filtered through her craft (“kintsugi intentions,” memories as materials), with embodied stress (acid fumes, trembling hands) under pressure. The “too stubborn or too broken” line offers a credible contradiction that informs her final acceptance of death as the cost of preserving the story. The one limitation is that her internal conflict never quite sharpens into a true dilemma between self-preservation and narration; she moves almost unambiguously toward sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and consistent—habitual quay painting, “ghost painter” distance, and her response to the cave all feel of a piece. Her motivations (to hold on to fleeting things while staying apart) are clear and credibly reinterpreted once she discovers the grandmother’s shells. The final choice to integrate the cave into her practice is earned by the journal and her life pattern, though the cost of her aloofness is more implied than dramatized in a concrete relationship. A bit more on-page friction between her solitude and any living person could deepen the character change.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s grief, devotion, and growing willingness to release Thomas are clearly motivated and embodied (“her voice breaking with screaming tenderness”), and her months-long work to purify her intentions gives her final choice weight. Internal contradiction—loving him yet needing to free him from protecting her—registers, though it could be sharpened further in on-page micro-choices. Thomas is more essence than person, but his guilt and protective love are legible enough for this length. The final merger feels earned, though the emotional transition from imprisoned guilt to re-emergence is almost too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s motives—torn between her own pull toward ancestral land and her self-appointed duty to guide others—are clear, specific, and consistently embodied in her actions. Her physical struggle with the bronze foot and the emotional cost of talking to the abandoned child and to Diego show contradictory impulses operating at once. The final renunciation (“some of us are meant to stay”) feels earned by prior beats and forecloses the possibility of following the migration. Minor limitation: her flaw set (beyond longing and duty) is implied rather than sharply dramatized in on-page mistakes.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s motives are clear and specific—relief from compulsive truth, then a broader mission—and her backstory of shattered relationships makes her desperation credible. Interiority is well particularized (“I told my daughter her artwork was mediocre…”) and the relief at regaining choice lands emotionally. The internal contradiction between valuing truth and fearing its brutality is present, though it could be dramatized more in-scene rather than mostly summarized. Her final decision to share the cure with a specific ethos feels earned and forecloses a path of pure selfish use.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Magnus is sharply drawn—his gift, loneliness, and professional precision (“timing them against his pulse”) feel particular and embodied. His central motivation (to understand the stranger’s act and the resistant boutonniere) is clear and drives concrete micro-choices. The reveal of the son and wife reconfigures his self-conception credibly, but the emotional turbulence of that discovery is somewhat underplayed, with few contradictory impulses on the page. The relationship with the son is powerful conceptually yet never dramatized in-scene, which mutes the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s regret, empiric intuition, and long habit of inertia are cleanly drawn, and his final shift from seller to seeker feels earned by what we’ve seen. The chip reawakening the grandfather’s promise ties his past and present into a coherent motivation. Internal conflict is present but relatively smooth—there’s little messy push-pull on the page once he reaches the cavern. A touch more embodied hesitation at the doorway could deepen the felt cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Seraphina’s motivation—disenchanted with rule yet unwilling to doom her people—is clear and consistent, and her final renunciation (accepting transformation) is credibly earned. The rage at her bloodline’s bargain versus her sense of duty is sketched more than deeply dramatized, so inner contradiction could be richer. Interiority is concrete (“crown and scepter feel like shackles”) and her micro-choices (dismissing the guard, touching the crystal, questioning the grotto) reveal character. The cost of her choice—selfhood for her kingdom—is legible and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyra’s motivation (to capture "the density of presence") is specific and sustained, and her attachment to her grandmother and the shell personalizes that drive. The internal pivot from control to invitation is credibly earned through Marcus’s gentle pressure and the twilight setting. However, Marcus functions almost entirely as an ideal, supportive mirror with little independent tension, so the relationship doesn’t fully become a crucible. The cost of Lyra’s shift is more implied than dramatized; we don’t see a path truly foreclosed beyond a soft admission that replication won’t match this first moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid and particular, with clear contradictory impulses—envy of earlier selves vs. exhausted self-awareness—and her micro-choices (continuing to write, then stepping outside to “begin by falling”) feel rooted in that psychology. The chronic disorientation around time is integrated into her emotional life rather than just stated. However, the piece stops short of a felt, costly renunciation or decisive turn; her final act is more symbolic than pressured. This keeps the characterization in a strong but not top-tier band for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara is sharply etched: her loss of smell, tactile relationship to the clocks, and ethical stance toward grief all drive her choices. Her micro-choices with Mrs. Huang (finishing the unsaid sentence, guiding her hand, reinstalling the screw “deliberately loose”) feel psychologically specific and earned. The secondary character’s motives and pain are legible without over-explanation, and the relationship dynamic (grief-bearer vs. translator) is clear and evolving. The only limit is that Mara’s own unresolved loss is gestured at more than it is put under direct pressure in this particular scene.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kira’s interiority is concrete and particular—her crystallizing skin, childhood memory of the mirror, and the counting rhyme all individualize her. Her motivation (pass the exam, manage shame around her condition) is clear and her final choice to use her scars as the rune feels earned by prior beats. The internal conflict between scholarship/rationalism and superstition/body is present and resolved through synthesis. The transformation lands slightly tidier than a truly top-tier literary piece, shaving a bit off the score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motives (professional dogma, guilt over the earlier exorcism, desire for atonement) are clear and drive her choices, and Marcus’s stance as both wounded and quietly defiant feels grounded. The relationship crucible—Vera vs. Marcus/Elisabetta—works, with status and moral authority shifting as Vera yields. Emotional embodiment is good (the bottle, the scent, the throat-tightening), though Vera’s shift from certainty to cooperation happens quickly, with minimal on-page resistance undercutting some potential complexity. The final change in her practice philosophy is credible but could feel even more earned if we saw her fight herself a bit longer.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kaia is clearly defined in function (last scholar, recurring witness, Arbitrator) with consistent motives to understand and resolve the cosmic stalemate, but her inner life stays mostly conceptual rather than embodied. The piece privileges abstract realization (“she understood”) over dramatized, contradictory impulses under pressure. Her final shift—accepting “Continue” and seeing past endings—is thematically earned but feels smooth, with limited felt cost or struggle. More concrete sensation or ambivalence in the three-thousand-heartbeat window would deepen characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shepherd’s vocation, ritual, and lineage from her grandmother give her a distinct, coherent interiority, and her curiosity about what clocks “really” measure motivates every on-page choice. Emotional texture is present in tactile focus on the key and the cistern, though conflict is mostly conceptual rather than sharply contradictory impulses in-scene. Her realization at the end feels earned by prior reflection rather than a sudden bolt from nowhere. The piece could push higher by dramatizing a more acute tension between duty (the station’s demands) and her private metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya is sharply drawn through concrete habits (the laser, mental mapping) and a coherent flaw (building walls) that directly informs her job and her relational history. Her internal conflict—security vs. connection—is credible and culminates in the call to Chen, which feels earned. A few lines drift toward therapy-speak shorthand (“physics of letting go,” “security doesn’t mean isolation”), slightly simplifying what could remain more conflicted. Chen is thin on the page but functions adequately as relational pressure rather than a full co-protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena’s contradiction—teaching probability while distrusting it because of her father—is vivid and well-motivated, and her final choice to join the “cartographers of contradiction” feels earned. Her emotions are embodied through concrete details (the window, the storm, the mica panes) rather than labels. The secondary woman is mostly a thematic mirror rather than a fully individuated character, but she applies clear, relevant pressure. The cost of Elena’s shift—reframing her father and her own work—is felt, though a touch more irrational resistance would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is sharply etched—a self-chosen custodian of liminal grief whose method and worldview are consistent and particular, and Eleanor’s fragments feel lived-in. His choice not to correct callers is a clear, character-driven stance that shapes everything. What’s missing for a higher score is a stronger sense of internal contradiction or visible cost in him under pressure; he’s eerily steady rather than torn. The emotional palette skews more contemplative than conflicted, which slightly softens the impact of the final endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s motivation is lucid and layered: professional duty, ethical revulsion at Thomas’s act, and compassion for Eleanor all collide in the choice to add the microscopic codicil. Her “gently thorough” nature is dramatized through research, ink craft, and the obsessive border text, not just stated. The internal conflict—whether to grant mercy by erasing or by contextualizing—is credible and paid off in her final action and in accepting the locket as “a gift and a burden.” Eleanor is lightly sketched yet distinct, and her simple gratitude at the end complicates Mara’s judgment without undercutting it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sadie’s characterization is vivid, specific, and internally consistent—her “professional ghost” status, rumor tactics, and desperate jocularity all line up with the phone offer and abrupt exit—while Marcus is somewhat more summarized but still credible (lonely, eager to matter, willing to give up the heirloom). The micro-choices around the trade (vial for phone) clearly reveal value hierarchies and motives. The key shift—Marcus accepting the phone and being “catalyzed”—is motivated and feels earned. The main limitation is that Marcus’s interior conflict is mostly implied rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, lineage, and sensory world are sharply drawn, and her motivation to find the stillpoint is coherent and tied to her work. However, internal contradiction and genuine struggle are minimal—she meets almost no resistance, and the realization that her blindness is her gift feels preordained rather than wrestled with. The emotional arc is persuasive but too smooth for top-tier depth. The final shift to “she had become the compass” is earned conceptually but not paid for with much on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s guilt, professionalism, and attraction to uncertainty are clear and consistent, and her interiority around the mistaken coordinates feels specific rather than generic. The grandfather/pen connection nicely individualizes her relationship to the anomaly. However, her peak-choice moment reads a bit too calm and conceptually tidy for the scale of the moral cost, with limited embodied stress or messy contradiction on the page. The emotional aftermath of choosing to transmit both coordinate sets could be deepened to feel fully commensurate with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya and Chen are sharply etched, with clear history, stakes, and distinct ways of moving through the world; Maya’s ritual with the empty Leica and Chen’s insistence on “translate it back” both reveal motive under pressure. The friendship carries quiet but real cost—decades of shared loss and erasure—without resorting to easy sentiment. Internal conflict (Maya’s fear of irrelevance vs. compulsion to keep composing in another form) is present but could surface in one or two more embodied, contradictory moments under strain. Overall, characterization is rich and specific enough for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s psychology is vivid and specific: guilt-ridden arsonist, pattern-spotter, heir to an erased lineage. Her motives for past and present actions are clearly rooted in traits (compulsion to burn lies, sensitivity to forgery) and the ancestry thread. However, most conflict is retrospective, so we don’t see many contradictory impulses playing out *in scene* under live pressure. The closing re-identification as “keeper” feels earned but relatively low-cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s characterization is clear and specific: terminal, intelligent, and quietly subversive, with the drumming habit paying off as a revealing trait. Her motives—resist being harvested, protect/empower the others—are coherent and drive her choices, especially the decision to release the pattern at clear personal cost. However, her emotional experience is often described in conceptual terms (“racing against her own dissolution,” “she was infinite”) rather than through embodied, idiosyncratic sensations. The relationship with Dr. Chen hints at guilt and power imbalance but isn’t deeply dramatized, so the interpersonal crucible remains underused.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is specific, competent, and textured—the gait-reading, mapping, and inherited tools all reveal a lived-in sensibility and clear, consistent motives. His desire to prove the power of whispers is strongly grounded in past behavior (maintenance reports, quiet board-meeting interventions). However, his internal conflict under pressure is minimal; he never seems genuinely torn or at risk of being wrong, which slightly flattens the emotional arc. Chen functions mainly as a foil and witness rather than a fully pressuring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira and Thomas both read as specific, with Mira’s wordless pedagogy and Thomas’s regret sketched clearly through behavior and backstory. Motivation is legible and aligned with action—Mira’s role as guardian and Thomas’s need for absolution drive every beat. However, Thomas’s internal conflict resolves a bit too cleanly and quickly for the depth of his guilt, and we get more declared understanding than messy contradiction at the turning point. Both characters tilt toward archetype (silent healer / grieving boy) rather than fully idiosyncratic individuals under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s motivation—to seed critical thinking as rebellion—is clear and consistent, and his tenderness with Elena gives him some dimensionality beyond “mentor as symbol.” However, his interiority under pressure is relatively smooth and assured; we rarely see contradictory impulses or genuine doubt, so his final stance feels earned but low-cost. Elena has one lovely beat of growth (“We’re not learning to win...”) but otherwise functions mainly as a reflector of the thesis. The relationship shifts slightly (she moves from fear to resolve), yet the story avoids any real fracture or sacrifice between them.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s internal contradiction—performing masculinity for safety in a world that no longer needs it—drives concrete choices, especially unbinding her chest at the call of Cetacea. Torven’s “combative tenderness” is sharply drawn and evolves credibly from gruffness to vulnerable ally. Emotions are mostly embodied and specific (“rough hands grabbed less often at those who slipped away like tide”), and the final renunciation of her dock life has a visible cost. A slight safety-net is the quickness with which Torven reaches insight, which trims some potential friction in their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mrs. Chen and the performer both feel specific and textured, with motives rooted in the mandate and in personal grief; the performer’s flatness reads as a chosen professional stance rather than a quirk. Mrs. Chen’s need—“lightness without forgetting”—is cleanly dramatized through her micro-choices (approaching, offering the bouquet, later practicing the narration herself). The internal conflict is more implied than actively dramatized in-the-moment, especially for the performer, whose moral risk under the law remains mostly conceptual. Still, the final adoption of the technique by Mrs. Chen feels earned and forecloses naïve joy or total repression with a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas’s motivation (to return after the ban and complete his revision of the scriptures) is clear and consistent, and his embodied interaction with the columns and lake gives him some specificity. However, he encounters little real resistance, and we see almost no contradictory impulses or moral friction—he never seriously risks or questions anything, so change feels more like fulfillment than a costly turn. The seven-year exile is told rather than dramatized, and his emotional history with the Order remains abstract. The final realization feels earned enough conceptually but comes without much personal cost or internal struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira and Enzo feel specific and textured—her colorblind perception, his guilt and shame around his daughter, and their bartering partnership all read as grounded. Motivation is clear and consistent (survival via barter; his desire to understand his daughter; her need for the courtyard). Internal contradiction is present but relatively gentle—Mira is very competent and rarely undercut, so we don’t see much real risk or self-sabotage. The emotional turn at the end (his vulnerability, her quiet facilitation) is earned but not deeply costly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s inner drive—to move from rote ritual to authentic connection—is clear, specific, and consistently expressed through her choices at the bells. The grandmother/mining backstory anchors her values in a concrete history rather than abstract ideals. Internal conflict is present (duty vs. improvisation) but plays out smoothly, without much genuine risk or ugly contradiction. Her final shift into “architect of moments” is earned but a shade neat and self-aware for the modest pressure she’s under.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena is sharply etched: a grieving artisan whose shift from wedding rings to memorial pieces makes her motive and current state legible and specific. Her micro-choices—keeping the light on, giving the crane with coordinates, reshaping the ring, preparing the tattoo—track a believable, cautious re-engagement with life. The internal contradiction between her role as guide for others and her hesitance to ink the phoenix onto her own body is strong and paid off in the final charged poise. A few thematic phrasings (“as she was learning”) verge on summary rather than dramatized inner conflict, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    Vera is specific and vivid in her professional identity and family lineage, but we get almost no real internal conflict or pressure-testing of her values. Her curiosity and competence are well shown, yet she never has to make a costly choice; Marcus functions mainly as a foil for exposition. The piece feels more like a character-in-situation vignette than a crucible that alters her. That limits emotional depth despite strong, particular traits.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, sustained, and escalates credibly from infiltration to self-sacrifice, and her embodied experience of foreign memories is vivid. However, her interior conflict is relatively low-friction—she rarely hesitates or reveals contradictory impulses beyond physical trembling. She reads more as an archetypal martyr-hero than as a fully particular, flawed individual. The final transformation feels earned but somewhat emotionally smoothed, with little mess or doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is clearly motivated by intellectual curiosity and familial loyalty, and her final choice to tend shadows as well as dreams feels earned by the accumulated history. Her emotions are embodied through concrete objects (stone, screens, light) rather than labels, and her regret over her grandmother has specificity. Internal conflict is present but muted—she rarely feels genuinely torn, more contemplative than pressured. The arc is solid but could deepen with one sharper moment of doubt or risk before she activates the interface.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and convincing, with her professional competence, desperation, and guilt interwoven in concrete actions (performing surgery, checking missed calls, composing her confession). The contradiction between “saving” the chameleon and exploiting it is dramatized rather than stated, especially in the line “I told myself I was saving you.” Her final choice to confess and dismantle the sanctuary is clearly motivated by the night’s work and feels like an earned, costly reorientation rather than a flip. The only slight limitation is that her self-knowledge is almost too articulate and clean for someone in acute crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s compulsion to reopen scars, her belief that “scars were libraries,” and her choice to undergo yet another surgery create a coherent, particular psyche. The piece gives her a credible before/after shift—seeking closure vs. accepting perpetual openness—but the conflict remains mostly reflective rather than dramatized in difficult on-page choices. Emotional texture is embodied (bandaged hands, root-whispers) and distinct. The main weakness is the relative tidiness of her final realization, which arrives with limited visible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid and specific—her reverence for the machinery and accumulated fingerprints, and her dual stance as clinical contractor vs. secret guardian land well—but her conflict remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete on-page dilemmas. The final choice to steal the film and falsify the report is clearly motivated by what she’s just psychometrically experienced. I’d like one more beat where her professional obligation bites harder to fully test that choice. Still, she feels like a particular person with a coherent worldview rather than a type.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s obsession, isolation, and “moonstruck” temperament are clearly established and consistently motivate her choices, especially her willingness to surrender her body to free creativity. However, internal contradiction is muted: once she commits, there’s little on-page resistance or fear, so the sacrifice feels noble but not deeply contested. Emotions are often embodied via strong sensory cues (cold, weight, light) rather than labels, which works well. The final fade into stardust is earned but could hit harder if her attachment to ordinary life or to another person had been more present.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kess is vivid, concrete, and specific in her role and worldview; the “dreamless one” tending others’ dreams is a strong, character-defining paradox. Her motives (protecting dream-cargo, cultivating sparks) are clear and consistent with her actions, especially in how she uses the lullaby. However, internal contradiction is more conceptual than dramatized—there’s little on-page struggle or cost beyond endurance. The closing endurance stance feels earned but could cut deeper emotionally if her dreamlessness were tested more directly in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The philosopher’s desire to recover his memory and reclaim feral imagination is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (following the hum, inserting the gear, vowing to return) align with that drive. However, he faces almost no real inner contradiction or pressure; his emotions stay mostly at a cool, reflective register. The piece leans on concept over embodied feeling, so his change at the end feels more like a clarified mission than a costly shift.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s controlling fear and her gradual opening are clear and consistent, and the leash/dog dynamic externalizes her inner stakes effectively. The internal conflict—wanting safety vs. wanting freedom/joy—is credible but rendered in a relatively tidy, lyric way rather than with truly messy, contradictory impulses in-scene. The ferry guides function more as archetypal facilitators than psychologically individuated characters, but that suits the piece’s mode. The final change (no leash, following light) feels earned by the prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s loyalty, guilt, and gradual understanding are coherent and grounded in concrete behaviors (keeping the bolt, staying alone, reading the discoloration), and Elena’s return with throat scars carries credible cost. His core motivation—to remain, to understand, to guard the place—is clear and persists through the years. Internal contradiction (duty vs. trauma, reverence for silence vs. desire for music) is present but could be more sharply dramatized in on-page moments of doubt or misstep rather than summarized insight. The final realization about safety in choice lands, but edges toward the neat rather than messy, lived ambiguity that would elevate the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    Syln’s devotion to truth and her family is clear and consistent, and her practical, understated choices (answering the messages, preserving pellets, confronting the pretender) feel motivated. However, she is emotionally controlled almost to a fault; we get little contradiction or embodied stress when the library is under threat, which flattens her inner life. The pretender and the heir are sketched as types rather than individuals, functioning more as symbols than nuanced people. The ending offers an earned stance (Syln’s return to quiet work) but the personal cost of that stance remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lena’s interiority is clear, specific, and rooted in her relationship with her grandmother and the reef; her mounting conviction that the town has transformed rather than vanished feels organically earned. Her decision to lower the station and dive is motivated and aligned with prior beats, though the emotional cost of that choice (risk, isolation, potential professional consequences) is underplayed. The “keeper of patterns/periodically eternal” idea gives her a distinctive mindset, but internal contradiction under pressure (scientist vs believer/descendant) could be dramatized more sharply in-scene. Overall she reads as particular and coherent, but the final choice could register more visceral conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira is clearly motivated by a need to make sense of the rebellion’s failure and to find a nonviolent, almost mystical path forward, and her interiority feels particular (barefoot, the inherited opera glasses, her attraction to broken places). Her emotional progression from exhaustion to charged resolve is credible and embodied through how she moves in the space and responds to the stones. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-friction—doubt, fear, or competing impulses don’t significantly complicate her realization—so the arc feels more contemplative than pressured. The final stance is earned but not paid for with much visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Chen’s characterization is vivid and specific—an elderly insurgent whose reverence for tradition is filtered through radically new powers—and her motives (resisting the Authority and trusting the plants’ memory) are consistent and drive her choices. Her embodied presence (weathered hands, volcanic heat through her bones) grounds her. The main limitation is a relative lack of on-page inner contradiction or doubt at the climax; she never seriously wavers before unsealing the amber, which flattens potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amira’s interiority is rich, specific, and embodied: her somatic markers, plant-attunement, and trauma history all inform actions like freezing, touching the cedar, and planning the arboretum’s future structure. Her motivation—continuing to cultivate life amid ongoing violence—is consistent and nuanced, with credible endurance rather than tidy transformation. The therapy language is justified via Dr. Mansour and doesn’t feel like generic label-speak. The final stance (continuing her planting despite unending violence) reads as earned stasis with real emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s inner life is specific, embodied, and consistent: the failed portrait commission, her grief over “her old way of seeing,” and the tactile work of sketching on tarot cards all reveal a coherent, pressured psyche. Her decisive change—accepting fragmentation as truth and choosing to paint again under new terms—feels motivated by prior beats. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. dark necessity, loss vs. exhilaration) are present in the scene, though they could be sharpened by one more moment where the cost of embracing this new vision nearly repels her. The absence of other on-page characters limits relational crucible dynamics but is appropriate to the piece’s design.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tracker’s motivation (seven-year hunt to understand temporal anomalies) is clear and consistent, and her occupational mindset feels specific. However, her emotional life is mostly summarized (e.g., “serene anger”) rather than dramatized in embodied, contradictory impulses. The avalanche backstory hints at deeper trauma but is handled briskly, so her final “understanding” lacks visible cost. She remains more of a compelling vector for ideas than a fully realized, pressure-tested person.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motivations are clear and specific—oath versus truth, loyalty to Marcus versus institutional duty—and her final choice feels earned by those tensions. We get concrete, character-particular details (twelve years alone, bodily familiarity with the locks). However, her inner conflict resolves a bit too smoothly once she decides, with limited sense of degradation under peak stress. Slightly more embodied contradiction in the final beats would deepen her beyond the thematic role she already plays well.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira and her father are cleanly differentiated, with coherent, embodied motivations—the bounty hunter marked by exhaustion and weapon habits, the daughter by ritualized care and value-language. The relationship functions as the crucible: his violence and her pacifism are in direct, lived tension, especially in the kneeling/sheathing beat. Internal contradiction exists (his need for violence vs desire for connection; her pacifism vs dependence on his hunting) but is mostly implied rather than fully dramatized. The final shared planting reads earned, though the emotional price of his profession remains somewhat under-explored on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kova is specific, competent, and calmly driven; her training and temperament are well-integrated with her tactics (“she had learned long ago that panic scared away the rarest catches”). Interiority is embodied through details like her bare feet threading between emotions and her heart “hammering rhythms” against the need for silence. Internal contradiction is present but light: she is mostly in control, with only glancing tension between fear and composure. The change at the end—carrying the goddess’s echo—registers more as an upgrade than a costly transformation, so the felt price of her success is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Margot’s motives (protecting the empire vs honoring truth) are clear and in tension, and her interiority—especially the deductive sequence about Geneva vs the board meeting—feels both specific and character-rooted. Her final choice to weaponize absurdity ("Tokyo") reads as an earned renunciation with visible moral cost. The family history (grandfather’s unreported asteroid, father’s memoir) deepens her pattern of complicity without softening it. The only limitation is that her emotional life stays mostly in the register of intellect and irony, with little bodily or relational texture.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara is vivid and particular—the constellation tattooist with the amber heirloom and an ear for subsonic guilt is memorable and coherent. Her motivation to relieve the haunted firmware and honor deleted code is clear and consistent with her history. However, her interior conflict is relatively thin; she moves from summoned specialist to successful mediator without much on-page doubt, fear, or contradictory impulse. Dr. Kepler functions mostly as a foil/expositor rather than a true relational crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Seraphina’s motives and contradictions are clear and specific: her compulsion toward order and visibility (“making the invisible visible”) conflicts with the grotto’s chaotic hush and the village’s unlearning. Her socially perceptive nature feels lived-in, especially where it shades into curse, though the cost of that trait could be dramatized more. The internal turn—from resisting mess to accepting it as generative—is earned by prior setup with chalk art and ephemerality. The only limitation is that no relationship on the page pressures her; all crucible work is between her and the space.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sarai’s motivation—guilt-tinged mercy and a compulsion to “restore” the broken—feels specific and consistent, and her reinterpretation of the curse is credibly earned by the visions. The embodied details (weeping from a “strange, cold warmth,” the physical pain of touching the stones) keep emotion grounded. Internal contradiction (punishment vs invitation, impurity vs mercy) is present but sometimes articulated in thesis-like lines rather than dramatized in conflict. The secondary character is lightly drawn but functional, mostly serving to reflect status change when the stones name her.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Cornelius is vivid and particular—his synesthetic perceptions and relationship to applause and time make him feel specific rather than generic, and his longing for Isabella motivates every choice. The love story is clear and moving, but we rarely see him in genuine internal conflict; he wants something and largely gets it without having to navigate competing impulses. Isabella is more idealized than individuated, though her brief on-page presence works emotionally. The final stasis—choosing an eternal encore rather than any mortal reset—reads as an earned endurance with some implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya and David are distinct, with clear motives (her driven curiosity and altered perception vs. his wary love), and their embodied reactions (her shoulders tightening, goosebumps) give the piece texture. However, Maya experiences almost no real internal contradiction once the scene begins; her conviction is unwavering, so her final stance costs her little on the page. David’s shift from skeptic to “participatory wonder” is quick and smooth, with little resistance under real pressure, which slightly flattens him as a crucible. The accident and “somatic markers” are intriguing but mostly serve as explanation rather than as sites of ongoing, dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira’s vocation, sensory modifications, and goal (“last sensory map maker,” “to become the voice of the unknown”) are clear and particular, and her choices do steer the story. However, she encounters little genuine resistance—internal or external—so we don’t see contradictory impulses or strain under pressure. The shift from “voice of the unknown” to “teach others to hear it themselves” is thematically apt but arrives as a told realization, not a hard-won stance. The result is an interesting, coherent character whose emotional arc feels under-tested for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s role and dawning purpose are clear and consistent, and her key choices (matching the echo to the hourglass, arranging the buttons, opening the jar) track cleanly with her archivist nature. However, her interiority remains abstract and largely unembodied; we’re told what she understands more than we feel conflicting impulses or emotional cost. The shift from “preserving prophecy” to “spinning futures” is conceptually motivated but emotionally underdeveloped, with little sense of risk or fear. This keeps her from reading as fully human under pressure despite the strong conceptual arc.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margot’s interiority and motives are clear, consistent, and rooted in specific history (the Moscow burn, three years on the run), and her final choice to take the mission feels earned by that arc. The tension between anger (“You let me burn”) and the pull of purpose is credible, if a little tidily resolved. Viktor has enough texture and moral ambiguity to avoid being a pure plot mouthpiece, though he leans that way in the exposition dump. Emotional embodiment is solid but could push further into contradiction and cost in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thomas is etched with clear, specific traits (the needle, his reading of promises, his serenity), and the woman’s burden is legible even with minimal backstory. Their motives are coherent and aligned with the premise, and his offer to “ease it” feels naturally rooted in who he is. Internal contradiction is muted—Thomas has no visible doubts, and the woman largely consents without struggle—so the emotional arc is more graceful than fraught. That lack of on-page ambivalence keeps this just shy of a deeper, messier transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei is specific and memorable—her potter’s habits clearly color how she moves, observes, and interprets the oasis. Her motivation (“to understand why this place resisted change”) is consistent and carried through to the end. However, the piece offers little in the way of contradictory impulses or genuine internal friction under pressure; she rarely feels torn or at risk. The final “change” is more a serene understanding than a choice with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina’s inner life is specific and credible, from her tactile relationship with the gauge to her layered reasons for gardening and for letting the heirloom go. Her motivation—to transform confinement into connection—is dramatized in concrete acts (helping neighbors, tending the fire escape, the harbor ritual). The closing decision to leave the gauge and replant is earned by prior reflection and feels like a real, if quiet, cost. A slight tendency toward abstract labels (“protected vulnerability”) keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s interiority is specific and consistent—her identity as “the last mammoth herder” in a modern body is vivid, and her isolation/independence tension is legible. The brittle-to-stronger emotional shift across the piece feels earned by the accumulation of images (sundial, hum, tribe of anachronisms). However, much of her conflict is conceptual rather than embodied; we’re told her crushing isolation and transformation more than we feel it through messy, in-scene contradiction. Marcus functions mainly as a gentle sounding board rather than a source of real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s vocation, pattern-obsession, and quiet stubbornness read as specific, and Chen’s mixture of hurt and lingering care comes through in his actions (“I kept your letters”). Their reconciliation is motivated by shared work and history, not just declaration, which helps. However, internal contradiction under pressure is relatively soft—Mira rarely feels genuinely torn on the page, so the emotional cost of reconnecting stays muted.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    Maya’s motivation and competence are clear and specific, and details like the vibrating coffee mug and her bond with obsolete equipment individualize her. However, she faces little internal conflict or genuine doubt; “cautiously hopeful” is asserted more than dramatized as a tension in her choices. Emotional embodiment under peak pressure (the “subsonic battle”) is lightly sketched rather than fully felt. Secondary characters function more as summarized factions than as on-page pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s fear vs. compulsion to explore is concrete, embodied (“claustrophobia already clawing at his chest”) and consistently drives how he prepares and moves through the tunnels. The “prudently adventurous” contradiction is dramatized rather than merely labeled, and his internal shift at the end feels earned. What’s slightly missing for top-tier is a sharper moment where his fear genuinely threatens to win and he must make a non-trivial choice against it rather than managing it smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sarah’s characterization is vivid and specific—prosopagnosia, portraitist background, and methodical habits all clearly drive how she investigates. Her sensory substitutions (texture, movement, angle) are well dramatized rather than merely asserted. What’s weaker is on-page internal conflict: she moves through the scene with high competence and little visible ambivalence or cost. The late articulation of her goal to “awaken…empathy” feels more stated than dramatized as a live tension.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motives (decode Lydia’s work, save the exiles, correct the record) are clear and consistently tied to her background as an inheritor of both object and duty. Her “spongey dread” and wavering certainty give her more texture than a stock competent scientist, and the final decision to stay and broadcast feels earned. Internal contradiction (fear vs. responsibility) is present but could be deepened with one sharper moment where evacuation is truly tempting. Secondary characterization (Hayward) is minimal but functional as pressure rather than character.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marla is vivid and particular—a bridge fiddler who reads winds as music—and her drive to understand the hitchhiker and reframe her regrets is clear and motivated. Her interiority is concrete in places (the specific failures she sees in the pixels), but conflicting impulses under pressure are more implied than dramatized. The hitchhiker is effectively archetypal but thin, functioning more as guide than character. Her final stance—accepting her role as “ferryman of forgiveness”—is earned but phrased somewhat declaratively rather than through a hard, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motivation—to protect this “territory” by proving the illusion of escape—is clear and consistently expressed, and Chen’s recognition scene is psychologically credible. The inherited criminal craft (suggestion over violence) nicely individualizes Marcus. However, Marcus’s internal conflict (guilt vs obligation vs curiosity about Chen) remains more implied than dramatized in embodied beats, which keeps his evolution in the “meeting” scene from landing at maximum depth.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s role, history on the station, and burden as successor to a broken predecessor are clear and motivating, and her choices (sharing the telegram, aligning the dreams with V442, deciding on the relay) track cleanly from those traits. However, her inner life is largely aligned and competent; we get little contradictory impulse or flaw beyond fatigue, so the arc lands more as affirmation than earned struggle. Hayashi functions well as a responsive foil but doesn’t exert much pressure on her. The final stance—“We carry this together now”—feels believable but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s motivation—clear his bloodline, save his order, and face the deeper ecological threat—is coherent and sustained, and his “finder of lost things” trait ties neatly into the ancestor’s contingency. However, his internal conflict is underplayed: there’s little felt struggle between fear of execution, anger at the council’s misjudgment, and loyalty to his ancestor’s grim choice. His “warlike serenity” largely flattens emotional volatility where a bit more contradiction could sharpen the final cost. The closing acceptance of being misread by others feels earned but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation and internal texture are clear and specific—“root‑bound” and “purposefully curious” are dramatized rather than merely asserted. Her fear/curiosity tension at the climax (“despite the fear that made her fingers shake”) gives some contradiction, but the conflict never truly bites. The choice to sign feels coherent but lightly costed; we don’t see what she’s giving up beyond abstraction. Strong, publishable characterization at this length, but not yet piercingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mara’s grief, reckless idealism, and need to mend Elena’s “unfinished” life are sharply drawn and consistently motivate her choices, especially in defying the keeper’s warning to bite the apple. The internal contradiction—trying to reject fate by burning the card yet descending here to bargain with it—is clear and paid off. Emotional experience is mostly embodied (card warmth, bone-and-root imagery) rather than labeled. The final change—accepting a merged destiny instead of clinging to Elena’s singular path—feels earned and closes off her previous, more self-erasing posture.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, specific, and rooted in concrete experience—road life, technical knowledge, shame from the expo—so his motivations read as lived-in rather than generic. His contradiction (detached precision vs. buried longing and shame) is dramatized through his handling of the cloth and his reluctant recognition of its past. The final choice—to claim the cloth as genuine and frame its value in lived use rather than documentation—feels earned by what precedes it. The only limiter is that micro-choices under pressure are mostly internal and could bear one sharper on-page cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sarah’s motivations are clear, consistent, and rooted in her history with the tablets, and the choice to consume the seed feels earned by her long devotion and curiosity. Her “kindly methodical nature” is mostly told but also shown through her painstaking work and cautious reflection before deciding. Internal conflict between quiet scholarly life and transformational risk is present but not deeply torqued; she moves to acceptance fairly smoothly. A bit more embodied ambivalence at the decision point would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kaine is specific, textured, and motivated; her blend of age, machinery, and custodial vocation feels coherent and her desire to remain as librarian-guardian is well earned by the final cadence. The visitor is thinner, functioning more as an archetypal seeker than a fully individuated character, but she does register as a person with history via the memory-threads. Interiority is largely implied through action and description rather than deep interior monologue, which suits the piece’s lyric mode but keeps it just shy of top-tier depth. The final endurance choice—Kaine remaining in her role, accepting her liminal identity—reads as an earned stasis with modest but clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interior life is specific and credible—the professional bunker inspector whose real fear is emotional “above ground” exposure is a sharp, character-particular contradiction. Her micro-choices (lingering to read, deciding to etch her own confession, marking the bunker as unsuitable) all flow from that core flaw. Crown, though off-stage, feels dimensional through the etched confessions. The only limit is a mild reliance on articulated insight that edges close to diagnostic clarity rather than letting contradiction stay messier.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s guilt, obsession with river data, and recent break from medication create a coherent, specific psyche whose motives clearly drive every beat. His core flaw—being “daringly methodical” even during the accident—is sharply dramatized and credibly underpins his present quest. The internal shift at the end (from seeking absolution in data to accepting forward motion) feels earned by what we’ve seen. A few moments (“The accident. Even now…”) flirt with summary/diagnostic shorthand rather than fully embodied contradiction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    The veiled dreamer has a clear goal and takes specific actions (descending, choosing to document, following the pattern), but her inner life remains more sketched than embodied. “Cautious exuberance” is stated yet not deeply dramatized in contradictory impulses or costly hesitation. The final shift from seeker to keeper is conceptually earned but emotionally under-detailed. More textured interior conflict would be needed for top-tier literary characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s conflict between career ambition and ethical responsibility is sharply drawn, with concrete tactics (forging documents, planting marginalia) that reveal a particular, competent mind under pressure. Her acceptance of losing the “academic empire” feels earned and costed. Marcus is serviceable but thin, more mouthpiece of generational guilt than fully realized antagonist, which slightly blunts relational complexity. The coffee-reading and plant-telepathy widen her interiority but could show a bit more messy ambivalence in the climactic moment rather than a largely pre-decided stance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s vocation, history, and competence are sharply drawn, and her professional doubleness (beautician/mortician) pays off at the end. Her motivation to preserve a “last spark” is clear and consistent. However, her interiority stays largely single-vector—calm, devoted, lucid—without much contradictory impulse or visible psychological cost in the moment. This keeps her from feeling fully three-dimensional at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is specific, grounded, and coherent: her history with Chen, the inherited role, and her mixture of steadiness and quiet hunger for contentment all feel earned. Her micro-choices (fastening the pin, choosing to climb, accepting the revelation and resuming her post) align with her traits. The main limitation is that her internal conflict over the scrolls and forgiveness is largely summarized rather than dramatized under active pressure, so contradictory impulses don’t fully collide on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Arbiter’s worldview and methods are sharply defined, and Marcus’s mix of guilt, self-justification, and real grief feels specific (“protected vulnerability”). The daughter, though off-page, gains dimension through the wind-chime images and the shard. Internal conflict is present (Marcus wanting both absolution and indictment) but occasionally drifts into tidy diagnosis rather than messier, in-scene contradiction. Still, the relationship dynamic is rich and the final charged poise for Marcus is well earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation—to transmit a dangerous, hard-won understanding of time—is clear and consistent, and Marcus’s confusion-to-recognition arc is believable, if lightly sketched. Her backward aging and secrecy give her specificity, but we rarely see true internal conflict or cost on the page; she feels serenely in control. The relationship dynamic (teacher withholding from student) is legible but not heavily pressured. The closing acknowledgment that she has “been withholding…for decades” hints at cost but doesn’t fully dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Yula’s motivations and long arc from restless mover to disciplined still-point are clear and character-specific, rooted in reverence for history and a desire to innovate. Her endurance across centuries carries a credible cost that’s legible in the dust, the bone towers, and the final exchange with her younger voice. Internal contradiction (revering the past while attempting something unprecedented) is present but mostly stated rather than dramatized in live, conflicting impulses. More embodied emotional texture under peak beats would push this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s sense of failure, quiet defiance (dropping the medallion), and tentative trust in mist walking are clear and consistent, with concrete actions tied to her interior state. Motivation (to find value beyond automated perfection) is well seeded via the grandmother and automation context. However, internal conflict is relatively low-friction: once she decides to step out, there’s little felt hesitation or contradictory impulse on the page, and the final transformation feels a bit too smooth, with limited visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlow’s motivation—to understand her synesthesia, find Elena’s truth, and accept or refuse this inheritance—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (entering the wreck, taking the journal, performing the ritual) track cleanly with that drive. The bond with Elena gives her an emotional spine that feels specific rather than generic, and the sensory way she experiences emotion is character-particular. However, internal conflict is relatively mild: her shift from “hiding” to full acceptance happens with little on-page resistance or contradiction, which softens the felt cost of her final commitment. A bit more dramatized hesitation or fear at the ritual moment would deepen the character change.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voss’s motivation—to understand and embody her cosmic purpose—is clear and consistent, and the contrast between “quiet enthusiasm” and “stellar doubt” gives her an effective internal tension. However, her emotional life is mostly articulated in conceptual terms rather than through concrete, embodied reactions, which keeps her a bit distant. Her final stance (accepting herself as the decision and eternal caster) is earned but the personal cost remains largely abstract. A touch more lived-in specificity would make her feel less like a function and more like a person.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The reaper’s wound (unseen, unremembered, yet compelled to serve) feels specific and embodied, and her choice to name the monsters and plan a recording for her successor is a credible, costly adjustment rather than a neat cure. Her backstory with the drowned lover is efficiently sketched yet emotionally weighty, tying cleanly into her current stance. Internal conflict between eternal duty and annihilating loneliness is present, though it could surface in a few more contradictory impulses in-scene rather than mainly in reflection. Relationships are necessarily off-stage, so the piece leans heavily (and effectively) on interiority rather than live interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (grief for her father, belief in her theory, need for vindication) is clear and consistently dramatized, and her modest power meaningfully shapes what she can risk. However, her interiority is largely linear—she is resolute with little on-page contradiction or serious doubt during the ritual itself—so we don’t see much simultaneous clash of impulses under peak pressure. The exhaustion and social cost at the end read, but they don’t significantly reconfigure her self-understanding. Strong, coherent characterization, but short of the layered ambiguity expected at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s sense of duty evolving into a commitment to witness and restore Elena’s erased story reads clear and motivated, and his profession (levee warden) nicely shapes his habits of attention. Interiority is specific enough—memories of penny candy, Elena’s laugh, the commissioners’ lie—but his internal conflict remains relatively smooth, with little contradiction or real moral friction. The shift from “monitoring structures” to “spinning the fragments into shared meaning” is earned but emotionally somewhat tidy. Secondary figures (grandmother, Elena, commissioners) function mostly as memory and exposition, not as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s motivation—to recover a sense of wonder before a life-altering Synthesis—is clear, consistent, and tightly linked to her identity as a rigor-trained yet secretly sentimental alchemist. Interiority is specific (“each fruit containing seeds of equations she'd never solve through logic alone”) and her final choice to sublimate the crystal is well-earned from prior conflict between preservation and release. The grandfather relationship is effectively rendered as a crucible even in his absence. A minor softness is that her epiphany arrives a bit smoothly, with little visible resistance at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Maya’s conflicting loyalties (corporation vs. forest, truth vs. strategic lie) are clear and embodied in concrete habits like the parachute buckle and the cached drives. Her final stance—shifting from “watcher” to active guardian—feels earned. Internal contradiction could be pushed further under peak pressure (more frayed, less composed thinking) to reach a truly indelible character portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s numbness, legal predicament, and desire to feel again are clear and consistent, and his interior voice is distinct enough to feel particular. However, much of his state is labeled (“I feel nothing…and that terrifies the part of me that still remembers terror”) rather than embodied in specific, contradictory impulses on the page. His shift from calling the idea “insane” to “understanding flooding through me” happens quickly, with limited dramatized struggle under pressure. The resulting decision is plausible but feels more argued into him by Chen than wrestled with in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira’s motivation and worldview are clear and specific, especially her affinity for paradoxical spaces and resistance to over-mapped development. Her choice to plant the seed before fully understanding it feels earned by her established curiosity. However, she experiences little genuine internal contradiction or fear given the clear weirdness and risk of the situation, which flattens her under pressure. The final acceptance of a larger mission lacks a visible personal cost or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motivation—to “conduct” echoes of laughter back into a grieving household—is clear, specific, and consistently dramatized through his ritual. His interiority (“mournfully eager”) feels particular rather than generic, and his ongoing commitment to this work implies an earned endurance rather than a neat cure. The Hendricks family are sketched from a distance but with enough concrete behaviors (whistling, garden parties, Emma’s singing) to feel real. The piece stops short of exposing a sharp internal contradiction in Marcus under pressure, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The guardian’s feral/human tension is vivid and specific, with homesickness and duty coherently motivating her choices, especially in giving up the pendant and choosing to leave. Her interiority is concrete (“homesickness carved hollow spaces in her ribs,” ice in her thoughts) and consistent with her altered state. The scholar is thinner, functioning more as a catalyst than a fully realized counter-presence, which slightly flattens the relational crucible. The final decision feels earned but the emotional cost of abandoning her post and world could be pressed harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marcus’s motivation—to escape a life of failed, invisible labor and prove his worth—is specific, consistent, and drives every choice, from theft of the crozier to blood sacrifice. His interiority is grounded in concrete history (thirty years of failure, whispered mockery) and professional detail. However, his internal conflict between faith and heresy is a bit too smoothly resolved; we rarely feel genuine hesitation or moral recoil in the moment of transgression. The final transformation feels earned but a little too tidy emotionally for top-tier literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s vocation, competence, and quiet defiance of Guild orthodoxy are clear and specific, and her choice at the end to “tune her life differently” grows credibly from what we’ve seen. Emotional life is mostly implied through perceptions rather than dramatized contradiction, so her inner conflict (career vs. personal quest) feels relatively low-friction. The piece reads as a strong, coherent single-POV character sketch with a clean arc but little visible cost or genuine struggle on the page. A touch more embodied doubt or competing impulse in the shard itself would deepen her.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is clearly sketched—patient, quietly idealistic, with a long-game motive to “heal the fractures”—and his actions (collecting fragments, initiating convergence) align with this. However, his interiority rarely shows genuine contradiction or cost; he never seems tempted to quit or fearful of self-erasure, which flattens the emotional arc. The woman passenger is a strong, economical emblem but remains purely functional, not a pressure on Marcus. The final shift into acceptance feels earned conceptually but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The architect’s motivation—to discover and literalize the “texture of connection” via her craft—is clear and consistent, and her interiority is rendered with specific, non-generic thought. However, she faces very little resistance; there’s no real counterforce beyond her fever, so we don’t see her make a pressured trade-off or reveal strong contradictory impulses. The emotional arc is more a steady deepening of certainty than a conflict that costs her something visible on the page. Strong, distinct persona, but limited dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara is competently drawn—a seasoned instructor caught between old and new paradigms—with clear professional pride and a quiet awe, but she experiences little on-page contradiction or pressure beyond wonder. Her motivation to teach and to integrate alien knowledge is steady rather than challenged, so we rarely see her forced into revealing micro-choices that cost her something. The Depth Dweller is mostly a dignified exposition device, and the students function as a chorus of reaction. The final reflective beat reframes her understanding but does not quite rise to an earned internal renunciation or conflicted shift.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara is sharply sketched—a specialist with a specific vocation, history, and ethical drive—and her sensory focus (sound, pulses) feels character-rooted. Motivation (protecting vulnerable voices) is clear and consistent. However, she rarely experiences contradictory impulses or visible inner conflict under pressure, so her heroism feels declared more than wrestled with. The change at the end is more situational (she’s located the source) than an earned internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s fear of confined spaces versus her need to keep a promise creates a credible, specific motivation, and her embodied unease in the flooded corridors lands well. Her professional competence and emotional stakes around Marcus feel grounded. However, her interior conflict stays relatively straightforward—duty largely overrides fear without many messy or surprising impulses on the page. Marcus and the rest of the team remain more emblematic than individuated, which slightly flattens relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and embodied—his heartbeat counting, cold breath, and tactile use of the shard make him feel particular rather than generic, and his curiosity/fear toward the ghost reads as a real contradiction. His arc from seeing the ghost as a problem to recognizing it as an “evolution” is motivated by the on-page ritual and observations. The cost—accepting a split existence—is mostly conceptual, but it’s legible and earned. Lack of other on-page characters limits relational pressure, but that’s appropriate to this design.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storyteller’s motivation—to preserve Thuvenli at any cost—is clear and consistently drives her actions, from accepting the curse to working through the night. Interiority is evocative but somewhat archetypal; we see dedication and reverence, but little contradictory impulse or real doubt on the page. Her final transformation into a tower of bone reads as an extension of her choice rather than a new, pressured decision, softening the felt cost. Still, the throughline from polyglot scholar to self-effacing conduit is coherent and compelling at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina and Thorne both have clear, personal motives (lost siblings/children, need for explanation) that drive their choices, and Marina’s undercover role adds a believable professional layer. Interiority is concrete enough—gravity tugging at bones, frostbitten hope—but sometimes summarized rather than fully embodied. The final decision “I’ll join them” is thematically apt yet comes a touch quickly, with limited dramatized hesitation or cost on the page. Still, their dynamic and needs are specific and coherent across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lira’s motivation and values are clear and specific—her attachment to pre-Mechanization beauty and music reads as deeply felt rather than generic rebellion. The “gap between knowing what she must do and understanding what it would cost” gestures toward internal conflict, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than embodied. Her fear, doubt, or selfish impulses are underplayed, which slightly flattens complexity. Still, her choices and perceptions feel particular to her rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ezra’s respectfully rebellious commitment to “absences” and illicit deliveries is clear, and his small choices (keeping the storm, trusting the unsanctioned network, handing it over) feel motivated and consistent. Interiority is specific enough to give him texture as someone who’s quietly idealistic, and the postal-professional details help individualize him. However, he’s largely unconflicted—there’s little sense of fear, guilt, or real hesitation under risk, so the internal struggle is muted. The Keeper is evocative but more emblematic than pressured as a character on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Emil’s grief, isolation, and craftsman’s devotion are clearly and consistently rendered, and his final choice to sing feels earned by the seven years of silence and work. His motivation—treating silence as possibility—is specific and informs his behavior throughout. However, his internal conflict remains mostly implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment micro-choices, which slightly mutes the felt cost of breaking silence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is specific, textured, and motivated by a clear, character-particular obsession with memory, topology, and his grandmother; his micro-choices (shelving, guiding patrons, following the marginalia) align with this. However, internal contradiction and active emotional conflict are muted—he’s mostly serenely pursuing understanding rather than being torn between competing impulses. The closing shift (recognizing topology as the “place” where stories live) is earned but comes with a relatively soft, conceptual cost. Relationships (with patrons, colleagues, grandmother) function more as context than as present-tense crucibles of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s motive (to restore her grandmother’s lost love) is clear, distinctive, and consistently embodied through her odd hours and ritual practice. The story earns her final renunciation by seeding her long search and the grandmother’s charge, and the moment she feels “something leaving her own chest” gives a real price. Internal contradiction—duty to the grandmother’s dream versus protection of her own capacity to love—is present but could be more viscerally dramatized instead of partly summarized. The fisherman-figure is effectively a projection rather than a character, which works at this length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vera is clearly motivated, competent, and quietly determined, with locksmith details and the grandmother connection grounding her, but she remains more emblematic than deeply individuated. Her choice to answer the call and endure pain is coherent and earned, yet we see little genuine internal contradiction or messy irrationality under pressure. The “DNA of courage” idea edges toward label-speak rather than embodied flaw. The final endurance—returning to ordinary life and waiting—lands, but with limited visible personal cost beyond fatigue and bleeding fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margaret’s motivation is clear and rooted in biography—her career and this return both flow convincingly from the childhood loss. Interiority is specific (fieldwork, pattern-recognition, professional habits) and actions align with that. The small internal conflict when she sees the darker memories is there but resolved quickly, so contradiction under pressure is relatively mild. A slightly deeper embodied emotional register at the peak (physical reaction to the influx of memories) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara and Kess are sharply etched with distinct textures—Elara’s scarred, didactic patience versus Kess’s raw, recent grief—and their motives (reversible exile, the mother’s fate, resilience as a goal) are clear and consistent. Interiority is delivered mostly through gesture and specific habits (walking backwards, ledger work) rather than labels. The relationship functions as a crucible: Elara’s decision to teach rather than immediately comfort forces Kess into a painful, accelerated maturation. A minor limitation is that some emotional beats land as aphorisms rather than fully embodied contradiction, slightly smoothing the messiness of their inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is clearly motivated, patient, and competent, with a long history that grounds her actions and a coherent worldview about liminal spaces. However, she experiences little on-page ambivalence or internal contradiction; her serenity and certainty flatten potential tension in what should be the riskiest hour of her life. The line “Other gardeners would have seen madness in her movements, but Mira understood…” gestures toward conflict but never pushes her into a difficult tradeoff. The final sense of completion feels earned but emotionally smooth rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mira is specific and vivid in her craft focus and inherited duty, with concrete habits and embodied work, but we get little in the way of contradictory impulses or real internal friction. Her motivation—to restore broken masks and ground the dead—is clear and consistent, yet largely untested. Emotional response is mostly inferred from atmosphere rather than deeply dramatized interiority. The result is strong, coherent characterization but not yet the layered complexity expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s vocation, perception, and methodical temperament are sharply drawn, and her attraction to the chapel/henge feels psychologically coherent. The piece does a nice job revealing her through how she reads damage, synchronizes footage, and decides to “reopen” the chapel’s purpose. However, internal contradiction and live emotional conflict are underplayed; she glides to insight rather than struggling against a competing impulse. The final softening of her expression works, but the cost of that shift could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and credible—her decades with “death’s language,” her reaction to the snow globe, and the choice to write in the captain’s journal all feel well-motivated. Her core tension between preservation and letting go is clear, though it remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized. The evolution from observer of loss to collaborator in “frequency shift” is earned by prior beats. A touch more embodied contradiction under pressure could deepen her beyond the highly controlled, reflective stance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Chorus’ core motive—hearing and answering the machines’ loneliness—is clear and consistent, and her vocation as a marginal balladeer gives her a particular lens on the world. However, she encounters little real resistance and almost no internal contradiction; once she recognizes the ghost’s nature, all her choices flow smoothly toward success. Emotional texture leans more mythic than psychologically complex, so the change she undergoes (finding her purpose) carries limited visible cost. This is strong, but not yet at the level of truly searching interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s curiosity and quiet tenderness are well realized through small, specific observations (learning Thorne’s shorthand, cherishing his marginalia) and her decision to decode rather than just tidy. Her actions align with this temperament and drive the discovery. Internal conflict is more implied than dramatized; there’s little sense of a competing impulse or real risk in taking the diary. The ending shift in her self-understanding feels earned but carries limited visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s obsession, professional background, and inheritance from Marcus are clear and consistent, and her refusal of rescue (even though off-page) credibly frames her as someone willing to pay a price for knowledge. Interiority is specific—her taxonomic focus and interpretive lens feel character-particular rather than generic. However, we see little active internal contradiction or moment of true wavering under pressure; she mostly affirms what she already believes, so the arc reads as deepening rather than contested. The final re-phrasing of Marcus’s thesis is earned but carries limited felt emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is specific and grounded in her sensory world—prosopagnosia, touch, and spatial thinking drive her motives and tactics. Her realization that “faces were merely one form of identity” grows credibly out of how she works rather than feeling bolted on. The final acceptance of the coin and the quiet choice to walk away reads as an earned stance, with the cost of losing the library felt. A bit more moment-to-moment emotional contradiction under deadline pressure could deepen her further.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s motivation and temperament (diligently curious, voluntarily solitary) are clear and consistently dramatized through her choices to volunteer, follow the birds, and obsess over patterns. Interior specificity is solid—her relationship to isolation, to the Guild, and to the found objects feels particular rather than generic. However, she experiences little genuine internal contradiction or on-page cost; isolation quickly becomes comfort, and we never see a live alternative she seriously considers. The final stance feels earned but emotionally low-stakes because no real path is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation and shame are clear and character-particular, and her craft focus gives her a distinctive interior lens. Her emotional life is embodied in images (ice, gears, mirrors) rather than labels. The main limitation is that her internal conflict resolves via a relatively smooth epiphany rather than a sharply dramatized push-pull between contradictory impulses in the present scene. The cost of her change is mostly located in past failure rather than on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motivation and long history with the colony give her a specific, credible drive, and her methods (chalk messages, bell, observation) align tightly with that motive. However, she remains more symbolic than psychologically complex: we get little contradictory impulse or moment of doubt, and almost no embodied emotion in the present beyond generalized care. The human families are sketched in functional strokes, sufficient for the fable-like frame but not deeply individualized. The final renunciation—letting go and fading—is earned causally, but its emotional cost is more asserted than richly felt from inside her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s role, burden, and shift from mechanical “adjuster” to singer of time are clear and motivated, and his recognition of Eliza as precursor gives him a credible lineage. However, his inner life stays somewhat abstract—more idea-vehicle than fully embodied person, with limited contradictory impulses or concrete, felt struggle on the page. The acceptance of the burden comes almost too smoothly, with little resistance or visible cost beyond conceptual weight. The strongest moment is his tactile engagement with the puppet (“felt the weight of her story flooding through him”), which hints at deeper embodiment the piece doesn’t fully exploit.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara is specific, textured, and internally conflicted: her dutiful endurance against her desire for freedom is clear in gestures like giving away the walnut and turning back before thanks can fully land. Interiority is grounded in concrete habits (the worn nut, the clock-checking, the blueprint obsession). The father and child are thin but function appropriately as pressure rather than fully rounded characters. The final state—accepting continued caretaking at real personal cost—feels earned by everything we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina’s characterization is rich, specific, and internally conflicted: a pattern-seeking scientist whose controlling love has damaged her relationship, now struggling between the urge to fix and the need to relinquish. Her motivation—to repair the bond with Elena without erasing their differences—is clear and drives every perception and micro-choice (carrying the chrysalis, drafting/deleting texts, finally sending one). The emotional shift from rigid certainty to tentative, vulnerable curiosity feels earned and rooted in prior behavior. The only slight softness is how smoothly her epiphany arrives, but it’s still credible within the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Merrick’s vocation, worldview, and cautious compassion come through clearly, and the child’s motive is sharply defined in her first lines and the photograph. However, interior contradiction and moment-to-moment emotional texture are relatively light; Merrick never feels truly torn about whether to perform such a dangerous erasure. The ending registers a conceptual shift (from selling forgetting to “perpetual beginning”) but the emotional and relational cost of that shift is only lightly sketched. Characterization is strong for the length, but not yet at a level of deep, idiosyncratic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Miran’s gift, weariness, and desert-hard resilience feel specific and internally consistent, and her final choice to absorb the fortress’s grief is clearly motivated by what we’ve learned of her. The sensory-interiority of “tasting” memories is vivid and character-particular. There’s a real but not deeply dramatized ambivalence between walking away and subsuming everything; the struggle is more asserted than fully staged. A touch more moment-to-moment hesitation or self-deception in the decision beat would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta is clear, particular, and motivated, with the choral librarian background and “empathetically decisive” nature nicely embodied in how she intuits frequencies and languages. However, she encounters little direct resistance and shows limited internal contradiction, so we don’t see her under real pressure. Her emotional life is sketched more through role and competence than through rich, conflicting impulses. The ending change in the town is strong, but Marta herself doesn’t pay or feel a sharply defined personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s motivation and interiority are clear, specific, and consistent: a technically minded person deliberately rewiring herself to read “abandoned dreams.” The bodily/emotional experience of the injections and memory-floods grounds her abstraction well. What’s missing at this level is sustained contradiction or visible cost—she rarely feels genuinely torn or endangered by what she’s doing. The change at the end (carrying the dreams within her) feels earned but comes with relatively little on-page ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Orin is clearly motivated—decoding the doodles and reaching the grotto—but most of that drive is conceptual rather than emotionally embodied. The “prism-mind” is explained more than dramatized, so we rarely feel contradictory impulses or real fear in the moment. Their acceptance of the burden at the end is thematically apt but arrives with minimal internal friction. This keeps the character compelling but short of the depth expected for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motive—to coax lost natural sound back into a silenced world—is clear, rooted in her empathy and craft, and her choices track consistently with that. Her interiority is particular (reading stress cracks as movements, feeling the siskins “returning”) rather than generic. However, she faces little internal contradiction or genuine emotional struggle in scene; we don’t see competing impulses or a real cost to her gentleness beyond implied effort. The end state is more a confirmation of who she already is than a pressured change or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    Viktor is sharply etched: his exile, pedagogical heresy, and attachment to the worry stone give him a convincing, specific interior life and clear values. His choice to stay rather than return is thematically grounded and emotionally plausible. The main weakness is that his internal conflict about the Academy feels mostly resolved before the scene begins, so we rarely see contradictory impulses coexist under pressure. Mira is sketched efficiently but mainly functions as an attentive disciple rather than a full counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s motivation—to open the diary and recover a lost mode of listening—is clear and coherently rooted in her pacifism and obsession with silence. Her interiority is specific (the catalog of silences, her reverence for the diary) and her final reorientation toward empathy feels earned. The main limitation is a lack of on-page contradictory impulses or visible cost; she rarely wavers or pays a clear price beyond effort. Relationships are necessarily off-stage, so we don’t see her worldview tested against another living person in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s ambition, impatience, and sensory sensitivity are clearly established and drive her choices, and her eventual rooted stillness feels earned by the process of tending and journaling. The cost—enduring the stench and relinquishing her desire to “master quickly”—is present but could be rendered with slightly sharper inner contradiction in the middle stretches. Master Thorne functions mostly as a thematic mouthpiece but does help frame her arc. Overall, the characterization is strong and coherent, if not yet piercingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kessa’s professional motivation is clear and consistent, and her competence reads credibly, especially in choices like following the tighter water gap and anchoring for the Inversion. However, her interiority remains relatively thin: little contradiction, fear, or doubt undercuts her capability, and the epiphany about resilience lands quickly without much dramatized struggle. Emotions tend to be implied by situation rather than embodied in specific, idiosyncratic ways. The final shift feels more like an intellectual upgrade than a hard-won personal change with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Maya’s professional motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her investigative micro-choices (photos, smoke canisters, monitors) feel grounded in her role. However, interior conflict is minimal—she rarely hesitates or contradicts herself emotionally—so she reads more as an able functionary than as a fully pressure-exposed individual. The realization about “emergence” lands more as intellectual synthesis than as a personally costly shift. Strong function, modest depth.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyrian’s motivation—to preserve wonder and avert the destruction of the bells—is clear and consistent, and her synesthetic perception gives her a distinct interior lens. However, she experiences little on-page doubt, fear, or conflicting impulse; the choice to descend and play the piece feels pre-resolved rather than contested. Emotional embodiment leans more toward exalted description than grounded, contradictory feeling under pressure. The resulting arc is persuasive but not deeply fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kessa’s motivation (seeking understanding rather than redemption) is clear and consistent, and her professional competence as relic keeper feels grounded in the way she experiments with the flute. However, almost all her internal conflict is backstory; in the present scene she encounters little real doubt or temptation, so contradictory impulses never fully spark on the page. Her decisive shift—to embrace weaving rather than sealing—has already happened offstage, so this scene confirms and articulates it rather than forcing a new costly choice. The warmth of the final acceptance (“her role as relic keeper had finally, truly begun”) slightly softens any sense of enduring flaw or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and particular—her “lucid turbulence,” emotional calculus, and sense of self as a stack of transparencies all feel specific and embodied. Her motivation (to understand, and then to preserve, others’ emotional mathematics) is clear and consistent with her choices about using the halo. The closing realization that she’s lost track of her “original” personality registers as a real cost, though it remains an insight more than a dramatized dilemma. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page conflict between her own identity and the borrowed selves that would force a concrete, costly choice rather than a purely conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is specific and embodied—her trembling hands, reverence for relics, and loyalty to Corvin feel lived-in, and her revaluation of her tremor into “resonance” is an earned, character-driven shift. However, internal contradiction is underplayed in the peak beat; once the Luminari appear, she moves relatively smoothly into acceptance without much on-page resistance, fear, or moral friction. Corvin exists mainly as an idealized remembered voice, so their relationship never quite becomes a crucible under pressure. A slightly tidier, more declarative final self-understanding (“She was no longer just a jittery courier but a living bridge”) softens the complexity of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera is sharply outlined as a meticulous, stubborn mystic-scientist, and her lifelong investment in this proof feels credible and embodied (“temperature variations in stones,” “electromagnetic fluctuations in jewelry”). Her actions align cleanly with her motives—coming to the arbor, handling the prism, documenting the frost—but she moves through the scene with relatively little internal contradiction or ambivalence. The cost of her obsession (ostracism, isolation) is stated more than dramatized in the present moment, making the final “triumph” feel emotionally one-note rather than thorny. Strong, coherent characterization, but not yet at the level of messy, high-stakes interior complexity demanded by top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s motivation is urgently clear and organically rooted in family history, and the memory-cost stakes align tightly with her choices at the loom. Generational backstory (each ancestor’s sacrifice) enriches her interiority and makes her decision feel inevitable rather than convenient. What’s missing for the very top tier is a bit more in-the-moment contradiction—she rarely wavers or shows simultaneous urge to flee and to continue beyond the brief sampling of tested memories. The post-sacrifice Mei is poignant but mostly reported via investigators, which slightly dulls the direct emotional punch of her hollowing-out.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Korin is specific and memorable—a meek, listening blacksmith whose methods and worldview clearly shape his choices (descending, using intention-forging, giving the blade with strict counsel). His motivation to return what people have traded away is legible and consistent. However, he faces little internal contradiction or real dilemma; he reads almost entirely serene and assured. The merchant gets a vivid but brief emotional beat without much depth of individual personality beyond regret.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s motive (find mother, decode shard, understand the withheld truth) is clear and consistently enacted, and her profession as a sensory map maker meaningfully shapes how she perceives and chooses. The mother-daughter relationship pays off with a credible emotional beat, but internal conflict (guilt over damage vs hunger to map) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in specific contradictory impulses. The mother herself functions more as a mouthpiece for exposition than as a fully realized, pressured character. The final shift—“We don’t stop mapping. We map the repairs.”—is motivated but arrives a bit too fluently, without much on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elsa’s characterization is clear, specific, and rooted in her long habit of solitude; her reticence and comfort with silence credibly motivate why the ghosts choose her. Her major choice—to accept the role and tend the light—is earned by prior details about her bond with Jonas and the stone language. Internal contradiction (her fear vs. her competence in isolation) is present but lightly sketched rather than deeply dramatized in-scene. Jonas and the other keepers function more as thematic pressures than as fully realized individuals, which is appropriate but limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira is distinct and compelling—the laughing storm herald with a practiced ritual, clear competence, and an emerging sense of larger purpose. However, her interiority leans more mythic than human; we get little in the way of contradictory impulses or embodied fear/hesitation even when facing her inverse self. The realization of her “true purpose” feels earned conceptually but carries limited felt cost or ambiguity. Character remains memorable but emotionally somewhat distanced.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kael’s interiority is clear, specific, and rooted in concrete sensations (the “new heart beating unfamiliar rhythms,” colors whispering origins), and his core want—to understand and manage the weight of stories—is well motivated. His choice to come when summoned and to ask “Teach me” lands as the central turn and feels earned by prior unease. However, his internal conflict (fear of being weighed down vs. pull toward stories) rarely comes under sharp on-page pressure, so contradictory impulses stay more implied than dramatized. Master Chen is vivid but mostly functions as a wise guide without much pressure or complication in their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is specific—a tired, competent worker whose lifelong maintenance habit and quiet acceptance of moon-healing feel grounded—and his key choices (studying, then reconfiguring the sextant, then reinstalling it) follow credibly from that temperament. Emotional texture is present but mostly calm and contemplative; we get little sense of genuine inner conflict under pressure, so his final insight lands more as an elegant realization than a hard-won psychic turn. The long-term cost of “three decades maintaining dead ends” is powerful but is largely conceptual rather than embodied in a messier contradiction or regret. This keeps the arc strong but short of the deepest character work expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s role and motivation as the last memory keeper trying to revive dawn are clear, and her choice to shift from grand rituals to intimate communal song feels earned. Interiority is concrete and tied to specific memories (“fragments of sunrise in her mind like scattered pearls”), but her emotional palette stays mostly within a single virtuous, resolute mode. We don’t see much real contradiction or darker impulse, which flattens complexity somewhat. The final acceptance that they must keep singing forever is a credible endurance stance with a felt but lightly sketched cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ezra’s interior contradiction—craving solitude yet compelled to respond to others’ pain—is cleanly dramatized in his choice to cross the room despite overwhelm. His coping strategy (projecting “enlarged tranquility”) feels specific and character-driven rather than generic empathy talk. The grieving woman is thinner but still credible, with her guilt line (“If I’d known earlier…”) sharply revealing stakes. The final realization that his late invitation had a purpose is earned by prior beats rather than feeling like a retrofit.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lila’s motivation and sensibility are sharply drawn—her compulsion to notice and to plant in abandoned spaces is specific and consistent. The reframing of her “cursed awareness” as ministry gives her an arc that feels earned by what we’ve seen. What’s missing at this level is real on-page friction: she rarely seems torn, and there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost in accepting this role. The emotional palette stays relatively serene, which flattens potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Elara’s sense of duty, meticulous habit, and quiet reverence for the vows are clear and consistent, and her choices (triaging, prioritizing, finally vowing to begin again) align well with those traits. However, her internal conflict over condemning most vows to oblivion is more implied than dramatized; we get little lived struggle over specific hard choices. The reveal of the founder’s vow motivates her final promise credibly but somewhat quickly. This keeps the arc strong but not quite at the most complex, high-band level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mae’s motivation (finishing her father’s work, capturing “the sound of trust breaking”) is clear and consistent, and her competence/persistence reads credibly through the three infiltration attempts. The legacy pressure is strong, but her internal conflict about betraying a community that knew her father is more implied than dramatized. The woman in the market functions well as a focused foil whose respect and eventual judgment sharpen Mae’s choices. The cost of her choice—exile from the market—is legible but emotionally underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s characterization as a luminous skeptic with inherited weather-carrier potential is specific and internally coherent, and the implants/ring externalize her doubt and belief nicely. Her core motivation—understanding weather-carriers and her grandmother—is clear and drives the scene. However, her shift from lifelong debunker to acceptance happens with relatively little resistance or textured emotional fallout, so the cost of that change feels under-explored. Secondary characters (Simon, Elena, Marcus) are evocative but thin, functioning more as embodiments of climates than as people exerting interpersonal pressure on Marina.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyra’s grief, perfectionism, and mnemonic gift create a credible inner knot, and her shift from archivist to creator (“a work she couldn't perfectly recall making”) feels earned and costly. Her micro-choices—following the pull to the cave, lifting the paintings, choosing to draw on the wall—track cleanly with those traits. The relationship with Maya is vivid despite Maya’s absence, and the lock as an emblem of Lyra’s self-imposed constraint works. The main limitation is that her breakthrough comes a bit smoothly, with little on-page resistance once she reaches the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera is specific and compelling—a truth-inscribing calligrapher whose lie-sensing ability and loneliness feel organically tied to the world. Her motivation around her grandmother’s missing letter is clear and carries through to the decision to deliver all the crystallized messages. However, her internal conflict about detonating the city’s “carefully maintained peace” is more stated than dramatized; we’re told the cost, but don’t see her wrestle with counter-impulses in-scene. A touch more contradiction or hesitation at the end would deepen the sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mariel’s motivation—to preserve the last “color of wonder”—is clear, consistent, and expressed through concrete action (hauling the fragment, recalibrating the bells). Her interiority is evocative but relatively serene; there’s little sense of contradictory impulses or genuine risk that she might fail or waver. The seasonal muteness is a strong character detail, but it doesn’t generate much on-page conflict or alter her tactics beyond thematic framing. The final stance—quiet, devoted guardianship—feels earned, but at a relatively low emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    M-47’s motivation—to resolve the destabilizing static while preserving the dome—is clear and consistently embodied in its meticulous actions. The nostalgia around Sarah adds dimension, and the re-interpretation of her “fears” as fuel is a strong character-specific beat. However, internal conflict remains mostly conceptual; there’s little on-page hesitation or messy contradiction as the burn proceeds. The final stance shift feels earned but somewhat smooth, with minimal visible struggle in the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta, Jorge, Mrs. Chen, and Elena are cleanly sketched with believable, specific motives (Marta’s quiet curatorial sensibility, Elena’s attachment to the mailbox as “home” for the letters). Marta’s listening-driven agency and Elena’s thaw from muteness to storytelling feel earned. The main weakness is a lack of visible internal contradiction—Marta in particular risks reading as an almost frictionless healer-figure, with minimal cost or doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s characterization is vivid and particular—her kinesthetic cryptography, relationship to her grandmother, and bodily certainty about the movements all feel specific rather than generic. Motivation is clear (unlocking Voss’s secret and understanding her inheritance), and her choices drive every beat. However, internal conflict is muted: she rarely wavers or struggles, so we don’t see contradictory impulses meaningfully complicating her decisions. The closing realization (“She was both the lock and the key…”) is earned but leans toward declarative neatness rather than an ambivalent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s grief, partial amnesia, and role as lantern lighter are integrated into a coherent, specific interior life, and her final choice to keep one vial reads as an earned act of endurance rather than a neat cure. Contradictory impulses—her need to know versus her fear of unbearable sorrow—are legible in the cemetery and coffin beats. Emotions are mostly embodied through concrete details (wildflowers warming, variable weight of vials) rather than labels. The only minor weakness is that the founders’ memory-extraction system is explained in a slightly expository block that leans more conceptual than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The summoner’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her history with the mentor and haven gives her a lived-in specificity. However, she faces little internal contradiction on the page; she never wavers between letting the prophecy speak and silencing it, so the emotional cost remains mostly conceptual. Her feelings about erasing potential loves, wars, and futures are observed rather than deeply conflicted through embodied reaction. The final endurance/renunciation reads credible but a bit too serene for maximal character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara and Marcus are sharply sketched, with profession-rooted obsessions and small, telling habits (her artifact collecting, his touching walls) that feel specific and alive. Their mutual attraction and shared strangeness are clear but under-pressured; we rarely see genuine internal conflict or a difficult choice. The final “Teach me” lands more as inevitable affinity than a costly decision. Strong characterization, but not yet pushed into uncomfortable complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina’s motivation and internal conflict are clear and specific: she’s both grateful for the peace of forgetting and uneasy about the hollowness it created, which credibly drives her return to the garden and her choice to reclaim memory. Embodied details like the shell cutting into her palm and dirt under her nails ground her emotional state. The final shift—accepting grief as part of self—feels earned by the prior setup. The only slight limitation is how cleanly the realization arrives, with little mess or backlash once the memories return.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mei’s vocation, family legacy, and current dilemma create a coherent, specific psychology, and her final choice to confess is well-earned from prior setup. The tension between her professional competence and moral exhaustion is clear, though her internal conflict in the moment reads a bit too composed and assured, with little genuine risk she’ll choose either forged decree. Embodiment is decent but not especially textured—her emotions often register through elegant description rather than messy, character-particular irrationality. The relationship to her brother is powerful conceptually but under-pressured on the page because he never appears in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Senna’s motivation (to understand the echo singers and decide what to do with that knowledge) is clear and consistent, and her final choice feels earned by the buildup of memories, family legacy, and the shell’s revelations. The internal conflict between staying embodied vs. joining the chorus is legible and present on the page, especially in the “sorrow, not joy” paragraph. Emotion is largely embodied through sound and physical sensation (“bones ache with recognition,” shell warming), not just labels. The only limit at this length is that we don’t see much contradiction or moral messiness beyond the single binary choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marina’s vocation, history with wrecks, and sensitivity to ghosts create a coherent, motivated protagonist whose choices (diving, bringing the globe, transcribing, accepting the broader quest) feel earned. Interiority is specific enough to avoid generic heroism, especially in the line about every wreck being “practice for this moment.” However, there’s limited on-page contradiction or genuine internal struggle; she moves quite smoothly from recognition to acceptance of her role. The chemist-ghost is effective but more functional symbol than fully pressured secondary character.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The net-mender’s sensibility is clear and particular—patient, observant, quietly radical in her devotion to unseen labor. Her motivations (seeking hidden patterns, honoring anonymous effort) consistently drive her choices to climb the tower, whistle, and mend. The emotional palette is more contemplative than conflicted, so we don’t see strong contradictory impulses, but the calm endurance itself reads as an earned stance. The final acceptance of anonymity feels like credible, character-rooted Earned Stasis rather than a forced epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s motivation and arc are clear and well-seeded: a professional debunker forced to confront a real conspiracy and then compromise his own principles. His internal conflict—expose the truth vs. preserve the sanctuary—is credible, and his final choice (burying letters, reburying the diamond) tracks with what we’ve seen. However, the moment of decision reads intellectually tidy rather than emotionally messy; we don’t feel much frayed or contradictory affect on the page. A bit more embodied resistance or self-doubt at the climax would deepen him from strong to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marlowe’s vocation, worldview, and habits are sharply etched, and her actions (tuning, broadcasting, “midwifing” the new age) clearly flow from long-term obsession. However, she’s largely without on-page contradiction or meaningful doubt; “variant allegiance” is asserted rather than tested. Emotional embodiment leans conceptual more than visceral, so we rarely feel personal cost or fraying sanity. The ending stance (“her work was nearly complete”) arrives more as fulfillment than as a pressured, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus is sharply drawn—his jars, loft, and response to the minor-key “La Vie en Rose” feel particular and embodied—and Elena comes alive quickly in her brief scene. His motivation (from solitary collector to “translator between generations”) is clear and consistent with his prior life. Internal contradiction is present but mild (hermit vs. bridge), and his shift toward purpose feels earned rather than convenient. The only limit is that his darker flaws and resistances stay largely off-stage, keeping the arc emotionally persuasive but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s blend of technical competence (“understood the mathematics”) and ancestral, quasi-mystical duty is well realized, and her final self-sacrifice is clearly motivated by the covenant and the stakes. The bodily response to sound and cold gives her interiority a concrete, specific texture. Internal conflict—fear/self-preservation vs. duty—is implied more than dramatized, so the decisive choice arrives a touch smoothly. The absence of on-page interpersonal dynamics limits the range of character stress-tests, but within a single-POV frame she reads vivid and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kira’s motivation and long-term patience are sharply defined, and the tension between her “wildness” and disciplined restraint feels specific rather than generic. Her interiority is vivid and embodied (“sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt”). However, her internal conflict never truly jeopardizes the mission, so we don’t see a hard, costly choice under pressure. Tomás remains a functional helper more than a character exerting pressure on her.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margot’s characterization is specific and coherent—her career choice, family history, and reaction to the lantern all align and culminate in a credible decisive act (resigning, repurposing her skills). The interiority is mostly concrete (rain, tunnel, body, the trembling hands) rather than label-only, and her attraction to “preventable deaths” is thematically grounded. However, the internal conflict resolves a bit too cleanly and quickly into a fully articulated mission statement, with little felt resistance to abandoning her job. Jerome remains more symbolic than fully individuated, which slightly flattens the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus and Eliza are sharply sketched with clear, specific motives—Marcus’s pastoral duty stretching beyond the prison, Eliza’s ingrained distrust of her brother—while Thomas comes through distinctively in absence via the journal. The emotional progression from guardedness to tentative acceptance feels earned, and small micro-choices (Marcus choosing to stay, Eliza asking for “another perspective”) reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears in Eliza’s simultaneous condemnation of Thomas and willingness to follow his repair instructions. The one limitation is that Marcus’s interior life remains more symbolically framed (chaplain-as-bridge) than deeply conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pioneer’s motivation (to reconfigure violence and transcend mere transport) is clear and consistent, and her final leap into the acid sea is well-earned by the preceding curiosity and experimentation. However, her interiority is highly conceptual and rarely embodied; we don’t feel contradictory impulses or concrete emotional textures, just a steady drive toward transformation. Secondary characters are sketched as a chorus rather than true pressure sources, with Sprocket offering mild questioning but not a crucible. The change at the end is meaningful but more thematic than psychologically costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lila’s role, skills, and backstory (father/Apollo-X) are clearly motivated and her curiosity drives every turn. Her choice to join the archive is conceptually earned, but the emotional and practical cost of abandoning her life is underplayed on the page. Interiority leans more on exposition than embodied contradiction under pressure. The relationship with the absent father is evocative but could deepen into a sharper crucible for her final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is sharply sketched—her shadow-woven uniform, prior anger, and peacekeeper ethos give her a distinct profile, and her choice to arrive alone is well-motivated. The keeper functions more as a thematic mouthpiece than a fully pressured character, but his weariness and patience feel specific. Mira’s arc from anomaly inspector to “gardener” of empathy is earned, though largely frictionless. Internal contradiction is present (former anger vs. current restraint) but not deeply dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlene’s backstory and current work cohere into a clear, particular psychology—someone who went to die and instead learns to stand witness to other endings—and the euthanasia/ice-watch pairing is strong. Her interiority is vivid (“a fold in patience,” “learning the language of conclusion”), and her endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis rather than a neat fix. The main limitation is that contradictory impulses under pressure are more implied than dramatized; we rarely see her genuinely tempted to step away, doubt her new role, or make a costly interpersonal choice. Secondary characters (Jakob, the Inuit grandmother) are lightly but effectively sketched, though they apply only soft pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus is sharply etched: his long-term endurance, quiet heartbreak, and choice to stay with the vines make his final openness to Elena’s daughter feel earned. The salvaged letter fragment and his philosophy of the vines both reveal motive under pressure. Internal conflict—understanding Elena’s choice yet being hollowed by it—gives him complexity without melodrama. The daughter is somewhat more functional, but her clear, inherited motive (to understand) still plays credibly off his.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist is clearly motivated by her vocation and immediate understanding of the prophet’s warning, and her leadership choices (act tonight, consecrate the clearings, remove the mask) track cleanly from that. However, she encounters almost no internal contradiction or doubt; her insight is instant and unchallenged, which flattens potential complexity. The scars and seven-year history hint at cost but are only lightly dramatized. The final renunciation (removing the mask) is earned but emotionally under-explored for elite-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara is clearly motivated—her archivist’s eye and urgency to preserve a hidden tradition drive the story—and her vocation colors how she perceives objects and patterns. However, she experiences almost no on-page internal contradiction or real hesitation; “She understood her role now with crystalline clarity” signals a very tidy, low-friction turn. Emotional states are mostly implied through lyrical description rather than embodied, conflicted reaction. The result is a strong but somewhat untested characterization that suits the piece yet falls short of peak literary complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interiority is specific and convincing—her love of etymology, reticence, and stubborn faith in living language all feel character-particular and drive her choices. Her motivation to defend ongoing linguistic growth is clear and consistent with her history of being dismissed. Internal tension (reticence vs. need to testify) is present but could be dramatized more under direct pressure from the Committee. The final stance—choosing to testify in an unorthodox way—feels earned and aligned with the traits we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ezra is sharply drawn, with his scavenger’s life, ritual chalking, and sorrow at realizing he’s already forgotten the moment he foresaw. His core motivation—to find the sound of time moving through a body—is clear and particular. The internal contradiction (curse vs. kindness) surfaces effectively at the end, though his emotional struggle in the middle is more implied than dramatized. The woman is functional but thinly rendered beyond her grief for her grandmother.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ezra’s vocation, temperament, and history are sharply sketched, and her competence under pressure feels earned and specific (“Forty years of repairing delicate mechanisms…”). Her core motivation (from photographing aurora to guarding time) is clear and consistent. The implicit conflict between following the previous keeper into escape and choosing stewardship is present but could be more actively dramatized on the page. The final renunciation (to stay and repair) lands, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maya’s characterization is strong: her vocation, decisiveness, and tenderness are clearly embodied in concrete choices like creating the album and staging the rooftop farewell. The mortality timeline gives her motives weight, and her professional habits (hymning the mundane) are tightly tied to who she is. However, her internal conflict is relatively muted; we see acceptance and purpose more than genuine contradiction or strain on the page. The goodbye feels emotionally credible but a bit too frictionless for top-tier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyra’s motivation—understanding the spoon shadows and then containing the threat—is clear and consistent, and her professional competence feels grounded in specific tasks (reading coordinates, tracing runes). The “quietly deliberate” aspect of her character appears in action (how she climbs, inserts the key, traces runes), not just label. Internal contradiction is present but muted: she shifts from scholar to warden with little visible emotional struggle, so the cost of that shift is more implied than felt. The final acceptance of her role is believable but could use one sharper moment of doubt or reluctance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thomas and Elara are sharply etched with specific histories, traits, and a believable sibling bond under supernatural pressure. His arc from skeptic to forgiving innovator feels earned, especially around the substitute body and his acceptance of what Elara has become. Contradictory impulses (yearning for the old sister vs loving the new; wanting her to stay vs accepting she can’t) are present, though sometimes summarized instead of fully embodied. Emotional beats could occasionally move from told insight (“his skepticism had evolved…”) to more dramatized interior conflict under the present-tense interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s motivation (finding a new way to guide ships) is clear, consistent, and plausibly rooted in her history with her grandfather and the lighthouse. Her competence with charts and polishing gives her texture, but we see little genuine internal contradiction or strain once the magic appears. Emotional beats tend toward earnestness rather than complexity, especially in the teaching sequence. Tomás functions mainly as a prompt for exposition rather than a true source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kira’s characterization is rich and specific: her choice to reject publicity and lawsuits in favor of tending the moss garden feels rooted in history, temperament, and values. The intergenerational detail with the grandmother’s pendant adds depth without overexplaining. Internal conflict is present but quiet—she’s already largely chosen her path, so we see more consolidation than struggle. Marcus is thinner but still credible, and the small, wordless interruption of his apology with the proffered cutting nicely reveals their dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina’s artistic obsession and reluctance to let go are clear, specific, and motivate every choice, culminating in the deliberate “unfinishing.” Her interiority is vivid but slightly more conceptual than embodied, with relatively little physicalized tension or contradictory impulses in-the-moment. The final renunciation—leaving the shell, accepting that hope cannot be collected—feels earned and forecloses a genuine path.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to revive the vine and with it the village’s rituals—and her choice to bring “memory” instead of tools is nicely character-specific. Her whimsical identity (butterfly wings, copper wire) gives her a distinct texture. However, internal contradiction and genuine struggle are underplayed; she never wavers or pays a clear personal price on the page. Secondary characters apply almost no pressure, so relationships don’t function as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemist’s motivation—to map the heartbeats of impossible places—is clear and consistently dramatized through months of labor and meticulous ritual. Her patience and craft-based identity come through strongly, but we get little sense of inner contradiction or emotional risk beyond quiet determination. The result is a compelling but relatively unconflicted portrait. The final endurance (long work, physical stiffness) reads as cost, but not a deeply transformative one.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (to understand and document the temporal mechanism rather than simply fix it) is clear and consistent, and her professional lens as a locksmith gives her interiority a specific texture. Her peripheral way of working and the inherited method from her grandmother individualize her nicely. However, her internal conflict is relatively low-pressure—the choice to leave the mechanism and focus on documentation feels thoughtful rather than truly costly. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but emotionally muted for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and particular—her weighing of sorrows in grams, her reinterpretation of her father’s “light” doctrine, and her relationship to the burner all feel specific and earned. Motivation is clear (to understand/collect the weights of burdens and maintain coherence in the grotto) and her endurance in the grotto reads as an Earned Stasis with cost. What’s slightly missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page contradiction or live internal dilemma in the present moment; her stance feels mostly settled rather than actively contested. The father relationship is powerful but purely recollected, so no on-page relational crucible develops under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Margaret’s interiority is specific and grounded in concrete actions—opening Thomas’s box, choosing to carve a handless clock, deciding to teach—so her grief and competence feel earned rather than declared. Her shift from “moving on” to “moving with” reads as a credible endurance/renunciation rather than a neat fix. The contradiction between her lingering grief and her “hauntingly practical” forward motion is present, though a bit more on-page friction (hesitation, a small mistake) under the ticking kettle could deepen it. Relationship dynamics are necessarily offstage but still palpable through how she handles his tools and memories.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kira’s motives and contradictions—builder vs. scavenger, ambition vs. resignation—are clear and specific, and her relationship with the ghost is a strong crucible for self-judgment. Her micro-choices (continuing to collect fragments, confronting the ghost with “more pieces today,” accepting the memory-keeper role) feel consistent and motivated. The cost of letting go of her original architect identity is legible but somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. A touch more concrete emotional or bodily response at the moment of realization could deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    Maya’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent—her curiosity about impossible hydraulics drives every action. However, she faces very little resistance, so we see almost no contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure. Her interiority is pleasant but relatively generic, skewing toward admiration and abstraction rather than character-specific texture. The final “I am now a navigator” shift feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, specific, and grounded in concrete history (the accident, the lost piano career, the years as clock scribe), and her final choice feels credibly earned from that backstory. The contradiction between the sanctuary as refuge and prison is clear and character-particular. The emotional movement from rigid grief to a more flexible integration of old and new selves is persuasive. The only limitation is that the decisive moment itself reads a touch tidy, with little on-page flinch or hesitation as she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara is well-realized: her history, profession, and family guilt interlock convincingly, and details like her fingers “reading surfaces like braille” ground her competence. Her core contradiction—pursuing distant legends to avoid personal truth—is clear and motivates the final decision to face her father. The emotional turn feels a touch tidy and declarative, but still earned by the accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation, temperament, and values are sharply etched through her attention to knots, her journal, and her plan to pass knowledge on, but she remains largely unconflicted—there’s little sense of competing impulses. Her motivation to preserve knowledge is clear and consistent, yet she faces no real test that forces her to choose between values. Emotional texture is present (numb fingers, hushed focus) but subdued and mostly in one register. The final decision to teach the granddaughter feels fitting but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara’s vocation, sensibility, and worldview are clear and particular, and Marcus comes through vividly despite being mostly observed. However, Elara experiences little genuine internal contradiction or pressured choice on the page—she continues an established practice rather than confronting a new dilemma. The “healing as map” realization feels earned but not hard-won. Relationship dynamics are mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in live interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Aldric’s motivation (reviving lost beauty/life) is clear, consistent, and embodied in his obsessive labor and physical deterioration. His emotional arc from idealized resurrection to accepting a “flawed genesis” is clean, if a bit straightforward. Interiority is vivid and particular (tears as nutrients, equations as prayer), though largely one-note in moral purity with little genuine inner contradiction. The final stance—choosing to cherish Novo rather than reject or fix it—feels earned but could carry more visible cost or ambivalence to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya’s characterization is rich, specific, and coherent: the arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter with “unyielding compassion” feels psychologically credible and textured. Her interiority is embodied (reading wind, water, scars, kelp) rather than abstract, and the ritual talisman choice cleanly crystallizes her values. The tension between inherited destructive impulse and chosen vocation is clear, though the piece leans toward a relatively tidy reconciliation with limited visible struggle in the present scene. A hint more on-page resistance or relapse pressure in the moment would deepen the cost of her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s long-term pursuit of anomalies and his role in completing the ritual are clear and consistent, and the woman’s age-old patience reads convincingly. However, his interiority is relatively thin for this level of epiphany—his shift from “luminous skepticism” to “realistically imaginative” is asserted more than dramatized through conflicted impulses. We don’t see him genuinely resist or misinterpret what’s happening; he adapts smoothly. The relationship dynamic is intriguing but largely cooperative, with little pressure between them to expose deeper flaws or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Keeper’s motivation and sensibility are clear and particular—her long loneliness and devotion to “share light without using fire” feel internally consistent and poignant. However, most of her struggle is summarized rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure, so we rarely see contradictory impulses clash in scene. Her final acceptance of the “troubling serenity” is emotionally credible but comes more as a stated resolution than the culmination of a tested inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Martha is sharply drawn as a competent, ritualized artisan whose history with grief and family craft feels lived-in and specific. Her motivation to do justice to collective loss is clear and consistent, and her relationship with the grandfather’s voice adds dimension. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a stronger sense of contradictory impulses under pressure—she rarely feels genuinely divided or destabilized. Emotional embodiment leans more toward serene focus than messy, conflicted interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theodore’s motivation—ethically obsessive atonement for a precise, finite mistake—is vivid, consistent, and drives every choice. His guilt is particularized via the carved seconds and specific harms, not just generic remorse. However, his interior conflict (duty vs self-forgiveness) is articulated more as clean thesis than messy, in-scene contradiction, which softens the edge. A touch more irrationality or resistance in him under pressure would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marta is specific, textured, and embodied—her quilting, gardening, and nocturnal rituals cohere into a believable interior life. Her motivation to decode the tapestry grows plausibly from her existing caretaking impulse. However, she encounters little genuine internal contradiction or pressure, so we don’t see her values tested or compromised. The closing choice (to plant the fragment tomorrow and keep gardening tonight) feels consistent but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira is sharply defined through vocation, worldview, and method; “ignorance cartographer” plus her attitude toward the Council give her an identifiable psychology. However, she experiences little embodied pressure or contradiction—she is calm, competent, and essentially untroubled, so we don’t see her wrestle with competing impulses. The Council members are largely types (engineer, botanist, programmer, Director Vance) rather than individuated people. The result is strong conceptual characterization with limited emotional or conflicted depth.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mariel’s motivations (smuggling stories back into the world via music and dust) are clear, consistent, and embedded in concrete craft choices at the desk. Interiority is specific—her “thistled calm” under threat is character-particular—though we get relatively little true internal contradiction or moral friction. Her competence and dedication are convincing, but the piece doesn’t push her into a choice that visibly costs her something on the page. The result is a strong, precise sketch rather than a fully pressured, transformative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlene is sharply etched: her ritualized process, inherited mask, and dual role as artist and archivist create a distinct, morally complicated presence. Her motivation to offer an illusion of transformation while secretly preserving evidence is coherent and layered. However, her internal conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in live dilemma—she never seriously wavers or pays a visible emotional price on the page. Thomas is poignantly sketched through select details, but he remains more emblematic than individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus and the historian have clear, differentiated motives—his abrasive commitment to uncomfortable truth versus her split loyalty between institution and accuracy—and these motives drive their dialogue. His three years of solitude and self-taught archaeology concretize him beyond stereotype. The final choice to collaborate is earned by what we’ve seen of his philosophy, though his internal conflict in that moment could use one or two more embodied beats to register cost more viscerally. Overall, they feel like real people under an intellectual pressure-cooker rather than mouthpieces, but there’s room to deepen contradiction and bodily emotion at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Chen is vivid, with clear history, values, and a believable mix of protectiveness and self-doubt around the zither and her heritage; her final choice to share and then relinquish the rosette feels earned. The students are sketched more iconically than individually but function well as extensions of her life’s work. Interiority is specific (“subtracting noise,” unlearning various forms of hatred) rather than generic, though true in-scene ambivalence under pressure is muted because nothing seriously jeopardizes the gathering. The emotional cost—accepting institutional loss while trusting her students—is legible but could be intensified with one sharper moment of resistance or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira is vivid and specific—her history as an underground chef and memory-taster grounds her motives, and her actions align cleanly with her goal of nurturing forbidden remembrance. However, she’s almost entirely composed and certain; there’s little on-page contradiction, fear, or moral friction about the risk she’s taking. Emotional embodiment through taste is strong, but we rarely see stress degrade her thinking or provoke true internal struggle. The final stance feels earned but relatively untested.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira is sharply drawn: a fundamentally dutiful toll keeper who is also a thief of power and a secret conservationist, with the honesty curse heightening her contradictions. Her motives—protect the bees, fear exposure, guilt about theft—are clear and under pressure from the blackout. The choice to broadcast feels earned by what we’ve seen of her values and her relationship with her grandmother’s legacy. I’d push even higher if her fear of concrete consequences (legal, social) were a bit more embodied at the moment of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina’s observational compulsion and quiet, almost devotional curiosity are clear and consistent, and her choice to follow the object trail and then surrender the shard is motivated and coherent. The interiority is concrete and sensorial (“cartographer of the imperceptible,” feeling the shard’s “violet warmth”), and the final realization about her role as witness grows plausibly from earlier traits. The main limitation is that her internal conflict remains relatively low-friction—there’s little sense of competing impulses or cost beyond the symbolic loss of the heirloom—so the arc leans toward contemplative rather than pressured. Still, for this length and mode, her characterization feels specific and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thessaly and Marina both feel psychologically coherent, with clear, competing values: Thessaly’s long-held guilt and need for witness vs. Marina’s investment in a clean academic narrative. The dolphins-choice backstory grounds Thessaly’s moral burden, and Marina’s trembling around the ampoule makes her internal conflict embodied. Their micro-choices—Marina asking to be shown, deciding to tell the truth with nuance, Thessaly asking whether she’ll be condemned—credibly earn the final reconfiguration. Some emotional states are summarized in slightly abstract terms rather than fully dramatized, which keeps this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is specific and credible: an ex-architect turned mathematical pilgrim whose regret over Sarah is refracted through his obsession with proofs and probability. His “measured recklessness” and refusal to rely on hope alone feel character-particular, and the dice as both tool and relic sharpen his motives. The internal contradiction between deterministic certainty and a longing to re-texture a past choice is well dramatized rather than labeled. The main limitation is that, at this length, his emotional register stays in a narrow, cerebral band, so the cost around Sarah is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and specific—her insomnia, creative drought, and sensory focus on moonlight and plants feel lived-in rather than generic. Motivation is clear (remembering the old man, breaking the block, testing whether kindness is remembered) and her actions track cleanly from it. The main limitation is a lack of sharp internal contradiction or visible cost at the end; her transformation is gentle and mostly affirmational. Relationships are mostly remembered rather than on-page, keeping the emotional crucible relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marta’s motives and inner life are specific and credible: the last guide, archivist of the displaced, torn between dread at inevitable loss and a stubborn commitment to salvage what she can. Her embodied reactions (trembling fingers, frantic tracing) align with this. There’s a subtle evolution toward “fierce tenderness,” but internal conflict could sharpen once more—e.g., a more explicit trade-off between saving more data and preserving herself—to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s vocation, lineage, and temperament are clearly sketched, and her motivation to use her backward-craft to fulfill her grandmother’s design feels coherent and specific. Her competence under pressure is convincing, but her interior conflict is relatively mild—she never seriously doubts, fails, or pays a visible price beyond strain. The line “She’d stepped beyond fate’s design by fulfilling it perfectly backward” gestures at a richer ambivalence that isn’t fully dramatized in earlier beats. Overall, she’s vivid and particular, but the arc lands more as fulfillment than as a hard-won, costly transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s motivation (compulsion to return, need to understand/fix what killed her) is clear and consistent, and the embodied reactions to the funhouse (“sweet rot mixed with ozone,” gagging yet breathing deeper) give her a specific texture. Her relationship with Cornelius has bite and history, and his role as both comfort and manipulation adds dimension. The internal conflict between revulsion and attraction is present but could be pushed further into true contradiction at the climax, where her realization comes a bit cleanly. The final acceptance of carrying Fear feels earned but might benefit from a sharper sense of personal cost beyond losing Cornelius.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kessa’s motivation—to stay when others flee and to transform the trap into an instrument—is clear and consistently expressed through choice and attention. Interiority is specific (her bodily merging with the mallet, reading cloud-script) rather than generic, and competence feels earned. What’s missing at a top-tier level is a sharper sense of contradictory impulses or doubt under pressure; she never really wavers, so internal conflict feels muted. The final decision to seek other prisons extends an existing trait rather than exposing a new, costly facet of her character.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s motivation (need to understand, loyalty to the expedition) is clear and consistent, and her final decision to leave Carapace feels earned. We get specific, embodied touches—trembling hand, breath catching—but her inner conflict (fear vs drive) is more implied than fully dramatized in-scene. The “quietly driven” quality does surface in her methodical work with spirals and her calm preparation to depart. A sharper on-page moment of hesitation or competing value would deepen her beyond a strong, competent seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s motivations are coherent and specific (rescuing truth at serious personal risk), and Marcus’s divided loyalties give the relationship a credible crucible. Her “emotional rationality” comes through in her calm, strategic responses rather than meltdown or denial. However, emotional states are mostly articulated in dialogue and exposition rather than embodied, and we get limited contradictory impulses in-scene. Marcus’s turn (leaving his insignia) is believable but lands a bit quickly given the scale of his institutional allegiance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Edmund is sharply etched: the last shore surveyor, heir to a family tool, quietly obsessed with preserving stories, all of which feel coherent and particular. His stoic sensitivity is mostly shown (rituals, controlled behavior, the small crack in composure in the ladies’ parlor) even though it’s also labeled once. Motivation is clear and continuous—from official duty to private memorial act—and his micro-choices under time and environmental pressure track. The main limitation is that his internal conflict (duty vs grief, documentation vs acceptance of loss) stays more implied than directly dramatized in competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s motivation (to verify truth during the rare quiet) is clear and consistently expressed through her methods and priorities. Her competence is well-drawn—bone-conducting earpiece, sensitivity to resonance—but internal contradiction or emotional cost is underplayed, keeping her arc fairly flat. The choice to descend during a blackout and stop when interference returns feels credible and aligned with her character. What’s missing at this tier is a sharper sense of personal risk, doubt, or inner conflict that would complicate her dedication to the work.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s grief and craft-based motivation are vivid and consistent, and her shift from raw mourning to transformative creation feels earned. The specific memories of Lin (steps, song, cranes) give her interiority texture rather than labels. However, her internal conflict is relatively smooth—there’s little moment where contradictory impulses truly clash on the page—so the final acceptance comes without much visible resistance. Master Shen remains more a thematic mouthpiece than an active pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Amira’s motivation is specific and compelling, rooted in concrete loss and an almost scientific mysticism about “unused potential,” and her tactics (studying perturbation theory, exploiting the cooling window) align cleanly with that drive. The grief is felt through objects and choices more than labels, which works well. However, her inner life is largely unconflicted—there’s little sense of moral hesitation or self-doubt about unleashing this discovery—so the final stance comes a bit too smoothly. Dr. Chen functions credibly as a foil, but remains thin and largely agreeable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira is clearly sketched—a competent, curious drone operator whose surprise shades into wonder—and her micro-choices (trusting the pilgrim, using the drone differently, committing to the puzzle) track. The pilgrim, however, stays more archetype than person (“speaking in riddles,” “knowing eyes”) and their relationship never quite becomes a crucible under pressure. Internal conflict is light: Kira moves from skepticism to acceptance with little resistance, which softens the sense of cost in her shift. Still, the emotional progression is coherent and grounded in concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s history and profession are sharply defined, and his guilt and complicity emerge convincingly through how he reads the carvings and interprets his family’s silence. His final choice to close the business and add the watch hand feels causally earned, not arbitrary. Internal conflict between inherited silence and his own corrupt bargain is clear, though the pivot to resolution comes somewhat cleanly, without much on-page resistance. A bit more friction or self-justification in the moment of decision could deepen him further.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s characterization is strong: her history, ritual with the drawer pull, and ethic around exchanges make her feel specific and grounded, and Thorne’s guilt and exhaustion are legible in a few efficient strokes. The parallel between their children and her brother adds depth to their bond. However, Elara’s internal conflict is somewhat smoothed over; given her brother’s death, her composure and generosity read slightly idealized, with little on-page struggle. A bit more messiness or contradictory impulse at the peak moments would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s guilt, competence, and fragility are well realized, and his small but decisive shift—choosing to teach navigation again—feels earned by his history and on-page behavior. Interiority is specific (utility poles as coping system, the empty flask, the seal laugh), and his actions track his ambivalence. The internal contradiction between trusting instruments vs. gut is conceptually strong but could surface more in live micro-choices rather than summary of the past. The relationship with Sarah functions more as gentle support than a crucible that truly pressures him.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s “guilt without memory” is a sharp, particularizing premise, and his micro-choices (accepting the ball, questioning the fairness of forgiveness, stepping onto the bridge) feel motivated and consistent. The old woman’s mix of weariness and steadiness reads clearly in a few strokes. Internal contradiction—wanting absolution yet doubting its legitimacy—is present but could be pushed harder under immediate pressure. The final choice to walk the path is earned, though it comes a bit easily given the scale of his crimes and their emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira’s longing and fear are specific and embodied (“paradoxically steady in my uncertainty,” trembling hands vs. firm voice), and her history with Kess gives the drive emotional weight. The internal contradiction between wanting to dissolve and fearing it is well dramatized through the metamorphosis sequence. The relationship with Kess, though mostly one-sided on the page, feels lived-in via how Mira senses her in the world. A hair more dramatized struggle or cost at the end (beyond quiet acceptance) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s motivation—unshadowing her daughter’s birth by reclaiming lost time with her mother—is clear, specific, and governs each choice from the climb to the restorative spread. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“choking her with its impossible perfection”), and her flaw (being absorbed in cards instead of presence) meaningfully informs the central guilt. The relationship with her mother gains nuance through the remembered “recipe quantities” of love and the ghostly tea ritual, giving their dynamic texture in very little on-page exchange. The main limitation is that her internal contradiction (attachment to ritual vs need to accept irredeemable loss) is more implied than fully dramatized in direct, pressured micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mei’s motivation and role as the last, deliberately prepared pacifist are clear and consistent, and her emotional responses (recoil at the screams, disciplined steadiness) feel grounded in that training. The internal conflict between pacifism and confronting a dimension of pure violence is conceptually rich but under-dramatized—she never seems genuinely in danger of failing or wavering. Her emotions are more often named than messily embodied, which keeps her just shy of full psychological particularity. The closure choice (to stitch/integrate rather than close the gap) is well foreshadowed by her upbringing but lands with relatively little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motivation—lifelong giving culminating in a desire to experience “the texture of transformation”—is clear and coherent, and her final dissolution into light feels causally earned. However, her interiority is largely summarized rather than dramatized in the moment, with minimal contradictory impulses or live struggle on the page. She reads as serenely prepared rather than pressured into a difficult choice, which softens the sense of cost. The prophecy link works conceptually but never quite bites emotionally as a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thorne and Amara have clear, grounded roles and motivations, and their professionalism and disillusionment feel consistent with their choices. However, Thorne’s interiority is relatively low-tension; he’s already fully on board, with little visible contradiction or fear undercutting his composure. The relationship beat with Amara is effective but brief and doesn’t significantly alter either character. The final stance—quiet commitment to the revolution—feels earned but emotionally understated.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Yann’s motivation (to decode her grandmother’s promise and understand the eels/patterns) is clear and carries through the scene, and her curse-driven hesitation gives her an internal tension that fits the premise. The moment where she realizes she’s been “seeing through time’s new transparency” is earned by prior beats. However, her emotional struggle feels relatively smooth—there’s little visible resistance or cost as she assumes her new role, which slightly blunts the sense of hard-won change. A bit more contradiction between dread and duty at the climax would deepen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s motives (to keep writing, to outmaneuver censorship, to map what the state fears) are clear and specific, and her micro-choices—writing poems in light, hiding envelopes, reinterpreting the censors’ scars—consistently reveal her values. The “furiously tranquil” composure under lightning and surveillance pressure feels particular rather than generic. Internal conflict is present but subdued; she reads as resolved and competent rather than meaningfully torn, which slightly flattens the emotional volatility. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting a life of hidden, coded resistance) is credible but its cost is more assumed than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marlowe is sharply sketched—her mechanical arm, prior injury, and commitment to questions-as-destinations give her credible motives and history. Her agency in decoding, dueling, and quietly conspiring reads consistent and specific. Internal contradiction is relatively light; she’s more emblematic than messily human, which slightly flattens peak pressure. The relationship with Reeves has clear status nuance and mutual respect but could bear a sharper emotional cost in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    October is vivid, specific, and psychologically coherent, with her name-molting and scavenger-artistry feeling particular rather than generic. Motivation and history via Marcus are clear and grounded in concrete experiences (prison library, taped-together pages). What’s thin at elite level is live internal contradiction in the present scene—she’s mostly serenely assured rather than under emotional pressure that exposes competing impulses. The ending stance feels earned but not hard-won on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marion’s grief, stubborn hope, and artistic intelligence are vivid and consistent, with clear motivation flowing from her wife’s loss into her obsessive work with the films; the reunion reconfigures her from seeker to builder of refuge in a way that feels earned. However, her internal conflict (hope vs. acceptance of death, anger vs. devotion) is more implied than dramatized in on-page micro-choices, and Sophia appears more as an image than a fully pressured character, which slightly limits the emotional complexity of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s role, competence, and motivation are clear and specific, and her conceptual shift about what “truth” means feels earned by what she experiences in the dreams. However, she encounters surprisingly little internal friction or moral cost for changing an unprecedented classification in defiance of the Council, so her final choice feels more affirmed than contested. The “waking from the assumption that reality required consensus” is an intriguing pivot but could show more simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. As-is, she reads slightly more as a lucid instrument of theme than a fully pressured, fallible person.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kenji is deeply and specifically realized: his silence, inherited teaching cadence, and attachment to encoded beauty all cohere, and his final decision to write to Yuki feels earned and costly. The internal contradiction between his placid exterior and his backlog of unsaid words is dramatized rather than told. The student is thin but functional as a foil, present mainly to pressure Kenji’s stance on pruning/severance. Emotional embodiment is strong, though Yuki remains entirely off-page, making the father–daughter dynamic powerful but slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elena is a coherent focalizer with a clear motivation, but her internal shift is smoothed over by summary rather than dramatized in scene. The antagonists (colleagues) are reduced to "performative" strawmen, lacking dimension or credible counter-arguments. The "career suicide" moment is reported rather than felt, distancing the reader from the emotional reality of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina's motivation (legacy vs. survival) is clear, but the pivotal change relies on a convenient epiphany ("The frost itself was teaching her") rather than pressure-cooked agency. The decision to warn others forecloses the "disappear" option, but the emotional struggle is smoothed over by the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character motivation is clear, but interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("interpreted as longing," "something like joy") rather than embodied complexity. The emotional climax leans on melodramatic clichés (tears freezing on cheeks) rather than specific, contradictory internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Silas is a distinct presence with a clear internal burden, but his emotional arc lacks friction; he accepts his radical abandonment of the surface world instantly. The "family curse" label substitutes for dramatized struggle, and his transition from undertaker to underwater librarian feels like a functional role-swap rather than a hard-won psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marta functions more as an archetype of wisdom than a conflicted individual; she lacks the internal contradiction or blind spots required for deep characterization. Her motivation is noble and clear, but her certainty ("Marta understood human nature") removes the possibility of genuine psychological struggle or error on the page. She acts as a perfect vehicle for the theme rather than a flawed human under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mae is a functional protagonist with a clear goal ("finding where unused love is stored") but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her actions are largely procedural responses to external prompts (memory, ghost's instruction) rather than active choices made under pressure. The emotional landscape is described ("copper of ancient heartbreak") rather than dramatized through behavior or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist serves primarily as a vessel for the story's philosophical concept rather than as a living agent with conflicting impulses. The epiphany is triggered by the object's dissolution rather than a hard, character-defining choice, making the emotional resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marcus's motivation is clear, but his agency is undermined by reliance on external prompts (arrow, piano code) rather than active problem-solving. The transition from "captive attraction" to secret guard is confusing—his role lacks internal consistency given the contradictory setting details. The "patience" attribute is stated more than dramatized in the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s internal landscape is rich, blending scientific expertise with grief effectively. Her motivation is abstract—seeking a specific "frequency"—but grounded well in the backstory of her grandfather. The reflection on cellular division feels slightly imposed as a thematic thesis rather than organic thought, but her agency in operating the forge drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cassia’s motivation as an "archaeologist of light" is compelling and distinct, driving the narrative effectively. The interaction reveals character through professional competence rather than exposition, though the mother’s shift from grief to relief feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.8)
    The character's constant self-narration ("The torch ignites," she narrated) creates a theatrical, artificial distance that prevents genuine interiority. While fulfilling a prompt requirement, the execution strips the protagonist of naturalism, making her feel like a mouthpiece for the theme rather than a living person. Emotions are stated via metaphor rather than embodied in reaction to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marcus creates a functional center, but the antagonist, Jake, operates as a stock villain with melodramatic dialogue ("Submit to reset protocol") that flattens the conflict. The shift from fear to empowerment feels rushed and intellectualized rather than viscerally earned in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist's "mild obsession" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through high-stakes behavior. Her epiphany ("then she understood") feels unearned by the immediate scene, relying on a convenient internal pivot rather than a pressure-forced choice. The emotional landscape is described with adjectives ("ambered," "marbled") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The protagonist is consistent and the internal logic holds, but the characterization relies on told traits (e.g., "remarkably composed") to bypass struggle rather than dramatizing it. The philosophical realization is earned intellectually, but the lack of embodied, contradictory emotion or risk of failure keeps the character engagement somewhat distant.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira and Samuel are distinct, with interiority well-grounded in their shared history and professional roles. However, their interaction feels slightly performative, with dialogue often serving as a vehicle for backstory rather than organic conversation. The emotional shift is earned, but the "doodle" communication method feels twee for characters of this gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marta is a distinct, realized presence with a coherent worldview that drives her choices. While she functions effectively as a mentor figure, the lack of internal doubt or significant resistance from the young woman makes her role feel slightly static in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ira acts with agency and clear desire, but the "obliging" label contradicts her on-page recklessness without sufficient internal processing of that dissonance. The internal arc—shedding the "mechanic" persona—is legible but feels slightly rushed given the low personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Motivation is consistent and the physical commitment at the climax (wading into the water) effectively dramatizes his obsession. However, early interiority relies on convenience and telling ("understood them instinctively," "felt lately inspired") rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is distinct, blending technical meteorological knowledge with the metaphysical "oracle" trait effectively ("swallowed this truth," "incorporating it"). The choice to smudge the signature is a strong character-defining action that earns the stasis of the ending. The "oracle" gift risks being a convenience, but the physical grounding in "frost-numbed fingers" and fever symptoms keeps it embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus creates a cohesive internal arc, moving from skepticism to witnessing with earned interiority. The motivation to "appraise" truth rather than collect trophies is well-dramatized in the final choice to leave the wheel, showing a clear hierarchy of values.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist is an archetype of wisdom rather than a character under pressure; her interiority is rich but static, devoid of contradictory impulses or difficult choices. She begins and ends in a state of mastery, meaning there is no struggle or agency exercised against resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies heavily on archetypes ("Mother," "Daughter") and summarized histories rather than active, conflicted choices in the scene. Elena's interiority is filtered through explicit labels ("therapist's voice") and retrospective summary ("moves and divorces") rather than immediate emotional friction. The daughter functions largely as a prop for the mother's realization, lacking a distinct voice or independent agency beyond the initial prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thrain’s interiority is distinct, grounded in her sensory limitations and "particular grace." Her motivation to "tend the echo" drives her actions logically toward the discovery, and the final acceptance of her solitude as a necessary function ("someone had to tend the echo") provides a felt cost to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Chen is a compelling protagonist whose internal contradiction—a spy who operates as a composer of fate—drives the narrative. The transition from observer ("arranging fortune slips") to participant ("becoming his own music") provides a clear, earned arc. The interplay between his professional cynicism and his artistic perception of the island creates a distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marcus is a compelling archetype with a distinct method, but he functions more as a thematic delivery system than a character under pressure. His motivation is clear, yet he faces no internal friction, doubt, or cost; his competence is absolute, which flattens the emotional arc into a procedural success. The interiority leans heavily on diagnostic labels ("creature that fed on unexamined certainties") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei’s interiority is rich and fits the lyrical mode, clearly establishing her motivation to find "chronological home." However, her emotions are often summarized through abstract metaphors ("homesick for a when") rather than dramatized through visceral, contradictory struggle or relationship dynamics. The "firing" provides backstory but doesn't actively pressure her choices in the scene, leaving the character largely reactive until the final conducting moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic lists of identities ("soldier's courage," "mother's love") rather than embodied traits or specific memories. The protagonist's struggle is resolved by a magical object's function rather than a deeply personalized tactical choice, reducing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.3)
    Lucia functions more as an observer of her own healing than an active agent; the emotional arc relies on metaphorical summary ("thawing," "permafrost cracking") rather than embodied choices under pressure. The transformation feels unearned because she faces no resistance or dilemma during the experiment, simply waiting for the vibrations to fix her.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena is portrayed with high competence and consistency, but her lack of internal doubt or struggle makes the characterization feel somewhat idealized. The transition from observer to active resistor is smooth and inevitable, lacking the friction of a difficult choice or a visible emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara functions more as a vessel for the sensory experience than an active agent; the transformation happens to her via the perfume rather than through choices under pressure. The "aromatically cautious" trait is stated as a label but immediately bypassed without creating genuine internal conflict or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Marcus functions primarily as an observer of backstory rather than an agent under pressure. While he issues commands ("Show me," "Pattern it forward"), the energy beings comply without resistance, removing immediate interpersonal conflict. His motivation—a "poet's hunger"—is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or personal risk in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara functions as a thematic vessel rather than a conflicted protagonist; she lacks contradictory impulses or internal resistance. Her path from intention to success is linear, with no "blind spot" or mistake to complicate the choice to play.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera is a consistent, competent professional whose internal logic drives the narrative. However, the central internal conflict—the temptation to consume—is resolved primarily through a "cardinal rule" rather than visceral, high-stakes struggle on the page, making her resilience feel slightly safe and static.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    Margot functions more as a plot vehicle than a fully realized character; her shift from "business complete" to altruism occurs instantaneously without internal friction or dramatized cost. Her defining trait of "shrewdness" is stated in summary ("negotiations now securing") rather than demonstrated through high-pressure choices or distinct tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.2)
    Kira functions as a benevolent catalyst rather than a conflicted protagonist; she encounters no genuine internal resistance or meaningful flaws. Her "boldly sympathetic certainty" resolves all friction instantly, leaving her without a dramatic arc of struggle or growth.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marina functions more as an archetype than a fully realized protagonist; she lacks internal contradiction or doubt. Her motivation is inherited duty rather than personal desperation, and she navigates the crisis without facing a difficult choice or paying a felt emotional price—she feels "only relief" despite the collapse of her city's entire temporal infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    Morrow is a coherent focalizer whose methodical nature aligns well with the "mathematics of emotion" premise. However, her internal landscape feels somewhat clinical; the emotion is described intellectually ("buried optimism," "mathematical certainty") rather than dramatized through embodied struggle or visceral reaction to the loss. The encounter with her mentor lacks the friction or desperate longing that the stakes imply.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Edgar’s transition from a solitary guardian to a collaborator is well-motivated and earned through specific on-page interaction. The "vertigo" of his realization effectively grounds the emotional arc, shifting his internal paradigm from hiding to trust with palpable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus's internal conflict between scientific detachment and immersion is well-drawn, creating a clear arc. However, his "reluctance" resolves somewhat too smoothly through memory rather than visceral, high-cost struggle in the moment; the surrender feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clearly drawn and drives the narrative arc from desperation to artistic renewal. The insomnia provides excellent physiological texture ("sleep-deprivation making her tongue heavy") that colors her perception. The interaction with the stranger efficiently mirrors Mara's own grief, creating a "relationship as crucible" moment that validates the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.7)
    Vera functions more as a vessel for the lesson than an agent of change; she enters, listens to the voice, and accepts the transformation without resistance or hard choices. The interiority relies on summarized realizations ("Vera realized," "She felt") rather than embodied struggle, making her arc feel passive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kessa is a distinct, consistent presence with a clear motivation. However, she functions more as a vehicle for the story's philosophical thesis than as a living character in a pressure cooker; her internal landscape is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult, on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a passive observer rather than an agent under pressure; her primary conflict ("analytical mind" vs. "artistic soul") is summarized via labels rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The "dare" involves no hesitation or alternative path, reducing her agency to mere compliance with the arrows.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elena’s transition from skeptic to believer is smoothed over by external forces—the tile "floods" her with memories—rather than driven by a high-stakes, volitional struggle. The internal conflict is resolved principally by the object's magic and the passage of time, leaving her final acceptance feeling inevitable rather than earned through resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vex's motivation is clear and consistent, but her weariness leans heavily on the "bored immortal" trope without a specific, dramatized crucible to test her resolve. The decision to join Thorne is immediate, lacking a moment of genuine hesitation or conflicting internal pressure that would deepen the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya is a compelling protagonist whose professional precision contrasts well with the emotional stakes. Wei's transition from rage to acceptance feels slightly compressed but functions within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is an observer rather than an agent of change; she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice. Her "faith" and "earnest" nature are stated labels rather than dramatized traits tested under pressure. Because she encounters no resistance, her character remains static and purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is textured and specific, grounding Mari's ghost-like existence in concrete sensory details ("texture of her mother's last words"). While motivation is clear, the character lacks active resistance or sharp contradictory impulses under pressure; her acceptance of "dissolution" creates a somewhat static emotional arc, though the final affirmation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    Marina's transition from professional skeptic to believer occurs without friction or internal struggle, making her arc feel unearned. Her "myth-busting" skills are purely nominal; she passively accepts the supernatural explanation rather than testing or engaging with it through her established competence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.0)
    Maya is functionally competent and fulfills her role, but her internal landscape lacks the friction required for high-stakes drama. The "impossible choice" between negotiation and resistance is resolved instantly without hesitation or on-page emotional cost, reducing her "dual allegiance" to a plot tool rather than a source of genuine character conflict. The trait "orderly intuitive" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vera is a competent, distinct focalizer whose specific actions (the chemical timer) demonstrate agency beyond mere observation. The "purposefully curious" trait is well-dramatized through her choice to stay, though her internal monologue regarding "budget committees" relies on standard "scientist vs. bureaucrat" tropes that feel less fresh than her technical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya is a competent, proactive artisan, but her characterization relies heavily on the "disability as superpower" trope without genuine internal struggle or cost. She faces professional pressure but no conflicting impulses; her apprentice acts largely as an expository sounding board rather than a distinct agent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Margot is a focused protagonist with a clear professional lens, but the required trait "subtly confident" is applied as a direct label ("subtly confident precision") rather than dramatized through resistance. The emotional pivot to trust the stranger relies on the convenient prop of the phrasebook page rather than a deeper interaction or struggle, making the trust feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a functional archetype without interiority, flaws, or internal conflict. She operates as a plot device rather than a character, facing no personal stakes or psychological cost. The absence of genuine struggle makes the emotional arc feel unearned and purely distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Maya is a competent, proactive protagonist with clear agency, but the emotional logic of the climax falters. The introduction of her daughter as a stake in the final moments feels calculated to inflate the cost rather than emerging organically from the prior narrative; consequently, her decision to abandon the child for the "eternal congregation" feels rushed and lacks the necessary agonizing friction to be fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus is a compelling, distinct protagonist with a clear mythic burden. His motivation to reclaim the truth is well-established, though his internal struggle is somewhat muted by the brevity of the piece; the transition from passive prisoner to active witness feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marlow is atmospherically rendered but functionally passive; he witnesses the plot rather than driving it. The ghost explains the timing ("You're early"), explains the stakes ("debt grows heavier"), and executes the resolution ("She reached for the bead"), leaving the protagonist with no decisive micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Calla functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction or a difficult on-page choice that tests her values. Her "haunting optimism" is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through a costly decision, and her emotional state remains static throughout the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Miriam’s return is motivated by mystical "dreams," a weak external hook that bypasses active agency. The emotional arc is smooth but lacks internal contradiction or grit; Yakov functions as a standard wise guide without creating interpersonal friction.

    Mira is a functional archetype who performs a role competently but lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a defined flaw tested by the scene. Her "longing" is largely attributed to the client or the atmosphere, resulting in a static character who observes rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera is a compelling protagonist whose agency drives the narrative; her duality as spy and fool is handled with distinct internal and external textures. However, the "drool" affectation leans slightly into stock caricature, and the internal descriptor "hemoglobin code" creates a jarring register clash with the established fantasy/fable voice, briefly disrupting character coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The protagonist's internal arc is legible, shifting from concealment to vulnerability, but the pivotal realization is delivered via diagnostic summary ("The medium understood now: healing required exposure") rather than purely dramatized struggle. This "label-speak" in the climax robs the character of agency, as the insight feels handed to her by the narration rather than earned through the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's motivation to translate is clear, but her interiority relies on labeled abstractions ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than embodied sensation. The "shrewdly innocent" child is a stock characterization that feels convenient rather than individual.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.5)
    Marina functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. Her motivation is clear, but her success is immediate and unopposed; she faces no internal contradiction or moment of potential failure that would reveal depth. The emotional arc is linear, lacking the friction of a true "crucible."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elena is competent, but her pivotal emotional shift relies on diagnostic telling ("methodical nature warred with an inexplicable playfulness") rather than embodied reaction. The transition from restorer to magical participant feels driven by the prompt's requirements rather than internal causality, and the sudden acceptance of the time loop lacks sufficient on-page grounding in her established traits.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's motivation is clearly dramatized through the final sacrifice, earning the emotional beat with visible cost. However, Serena relies on archetypal shorthand ("charming rogue," "practiced nonchalance") and her dialogue feels slightly performative rather than grounded in the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.0)
    The protagonist serves as a symbolic archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking specific, embodied interiority or contradictory impulses. The reliance on summary prevents the dramatization of micro-choices or active struggle within a defined scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira is a consistent, functional protagonist whose actions align perfectly with her established motivation. However, she lacks internal contradiction or a "crucible" moment; her success is a matter of competence rather than a difficult choice between competing values. The emotion, while described, feels more aesthetic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is competent and her motivation is clear, but the "carefully reckless" attribute reads more as an authorial label than a driver of costly choices. Her internal struggle is minimal; the breakthrough arrives without a significant moment of doubt or personal sacrifice, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is a highly competent protagonist with a clear, professionally grounded motivation. Her interiority is vivid ("measured not just land, but the distances between hearts"), but she lacks a significant internal flaw or on-page struggle; the solution comes to her through genius rather than a crucible of difficult choices, making her feel slightly idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    Margot is distinct, but her internal arc is largely summarized through seasonal metaphors ("winter's quiet work," "learning to trust") rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure. The "withering" to "blooming" trajectory feels observed from a distance rather than lived on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina's internal landscape is well-mapped, linking her father's obsession to her own grief with clarity. The shift from searching to creating (drawing her own codes) provides a solid internal arc. However, the emotional processing feels somewhat intellectualized through the weather metaphor rather than viscerally felt, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira is a passive protagonist whose primary actions are waiting and "knowing immediately," leaving her with no distinct on-page struggle. The epiphany of belonging is stated in exposition rather than earned through a high-stakes choice or renunciation, making the internal arc feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    Characterization relies heavily on declared traits ("cheerful gloom") rather than dramatized contradictions or embodied habits. The protagonist functions as a passive observer of her own concept, and her "cheerful gloom" is told to the reader rather than revealed through friction or costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus is clearly defined as an observer and engineer of emotion, with a consistent internal method. However, he lacks deep internal friction or vulnerability; his interactions (fixing the child, fixing the teen) feel orchestrated without risk of failure, making him function more as a magical helper than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mira is an archetype of the "martyr artist" rather than a fleshed-out character; her decision to sacrifice herself is made before the scene begins, removing active struggle. The emotional landscape is summarized ("loneliness threatened to unmoor her") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or hesitation in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marcus possesses a distinct, profession-based worldview ("seeing stress fractures") that grounds the narrative. However, the internal arc lacks sufficient friction; his progression from regret to wisdom feels linear and inevitable, missing the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands. He functions more as a vessel for the theme than a character making difficult choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marcus’s internal conflict is clearly drawn, and the backstory of the "bargain" adds depth to his guilt. However, the dialogue in the climactic voice note ("Every scar is a word in a language...") feels overly composed and poetic, breaking the naturalism of a firefighter's voice. This register mismatch flattens the character into an authorial mouthpiece at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    Marina functions as a vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character; her "logical mind" is asserted via exposition ("initially rebelled") rather than dramatized through struggle or error. The choice to teach others at the end feels like a summary of intent rather than a decision forged in the crucible of the scene. Emotional complexity is flattened by the reduction of grief to a literal mathematical formula.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mira functions as a vessel for the concept rather than a conflicted agent; her "burden" is stated in exposition ("Legacy's burden, her mother had called it") but never tested by a difficult choice or contradictory impulse. She accepts her role without struggle, resulting in a character who performs the plot rather than driving it through specific, costly agency.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya is motivated and consistent, but her internal landscape is defined largely by sentimental abstraction ("borrowed heartbeat," "infinite grace") rather than contradictory, embodied human impulse. The "borrowed heartbeat" reads more as a magical device than a somatic reality, and her emotional state lacks the friction or irrationality of a parent in true crisis; she remains perfectly, perceptively calm without a cracking point.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist whose specific backstory—transforming grief into "operative gentleness"—distinctly shapes her tactical choice to break protocol. Her interiority is grounded in the concrete loss of her brother, and the transition from violence to patience feels earned and specific rather than generic. The choice to reveal failures rather than grievances acts as a strong, character-driven engine for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Vera is a compelling, contradictory figure whose "amoral philanthropist" persona drives every choice in the scene. The internal logic of destroying ecosystems to create "archives of absence" is chillingly consistent, and her specific blend of ruthlessness and sentimentality feels fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyralei is defined by backstory and exposition rather than active struggle in the scene; her rebellion meets no resistance, and she faces no internal doubt or tangible sacrifice on the page. The protagonist remains static, succeeding without the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.6)
    Marcus is a coherent focalizer with a consistent "urbane" worldview, but his "uncommonly serene" nature acts as a shield against deeper on-page vulnerability. The resolution—an intellectual pivot to "reverse" the narrative—feels like a conceptual victory rather than a choice comprised of difficult, embodied emotional trade-offs in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira functions as a consistent vessel for the story's concept but lacks internal friction or contradiction; her motivation is delivered via abstract summary ("thought about overlooked histories") rather than embodied personal need. The "esoteric realist" label feels like a role definition rather than a lived identity, leaving her slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's specific expertise (lost wax casting) grounds her emotional arc beautifully, linking trade to theme. However, the resolution relies on a lineage coincidence ("Elsa" on the card) rather than purely character agency, softening the earned nature of her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kira's interiority is engaging, but her primary trait ("precisely playful") relies on diagnostic telling rather than dramatized action. The peak moment of realization is undercut by a label-heavy explanation of her coping mechanism ("wasn't personality—it was a survival mechanism") instead of embodying that reaction in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or on-page struggle; her success is procedural and uninterrupted, resembling a checklist rather than a drama. The "frugality" cost is backstory, not a price paid in the scene to force a difficult choice or trade-off. She faces no contradictory impulses, and her competence encounters no friction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.9)
    Characterization relies on archetypes (the wise monk, the angry magistrate) rather than individuated personalities. Marcus lacks internal conflict or doubt, operating as a perfect plot device who is "three moves ahead," while the Magistrate’s instant psychological conversion via a magical object bypasses the genuine struggle required for a credible arc. Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    Elara functions as a plot device rather than a character; her stated trait of being "firmly grounded in physical requirements" is immediately contradicted by her unhesitating leap to mystical breathing rituals without internal conflict. The astronomer is a passive recipient of her wisdom, lacking agency or distinct personality beyond his desperation. The relationship dynamics are purely functional, serving to advance the ritual rather than creating genuine interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elara’s internal contradiction—packing the "wrong" bag subconsciously while consciously swearing a vow—is a strong, character-specific beat that anchors her motivation. However, the internal conflict collapses too easily; her resistance vanishes the moment she sees the eyes, making the "vow" feel like a paper obstacle rather than a deep emotional hurdle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.5)
    The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the concept; the central realization ("She understood suddenly") is an unearned epiphany rather than a result of active struggle. The encounter with the self lacks emotional friction, resolving in cryptic agreement rather than dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mira is defined by high competence, functioning more as a key to the setting's locks than a character with internal contradictions. While her agency drives the plot, she lacks a distinct internal struggle or a moment of doubt that would humanize the stakes. The "cost" of her final choice feels negligible, reducing the emotional impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s internal landscape effectively blends scientific skepticism with longing, grounding the surreal encounter. While the dialogue occasionally drifts into exposition ("The garden isn't a place..."), the final choice to reject oblivion is character-specific and earned by the preceding interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions efficiently as a puzzle-solver but lacks embodied resistance or internal conflict; her skill set handles the challenge with ease. The ending choice to leave reality feels inevitable rather than hard-won, as the narrative smooths over the emotional weight of abandoning her world. The "smile" at the climax reflects satisfaction but undermines the potential gravity of the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist is an archetype of competence who faces no internal contradiction or significant error. While her skills are established, the lack of a difficult choice or personal cost makes her journey feel static. The realization at the end is intellectual rather than forged through high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mira functions primarily as a vessel for the plot rather than an active agent; she follows the instructions of a vision without facing a difficult choice or trade-off in the scene. While her backstory of endurance provides motivation, her on-page actions lack internal conflict or the risk of failure, resulting in a competent but passive protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    Lyra functions more as a passive observer and philosopher than an agent under pressure; she lacks embodied internal contradiction or high-stakes choices. Her primary action is realizing a thematic truth rather than navigating a dilemma with visible cost, making the characterization feel functional but static.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kaia functions as a competent agent of change but lacks internal contradiction or struggle. She arrives with the solution, implements it without hesitation, and succeeds without paying a personal price. The absence of conflicting impulses or genuine doubt makes her feel more like a narrative device than a living character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mira functions well as a steady, observant guide, and the mentor/student dynamic is clear. However, Mira lacks significant internal conflict or flaws; she operates from a position of static wisdom, which limits the dramatic tension of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s internal conflict between her father’s bunker philosophy and the trellis’s freedom is compelling and drives the narrative. Her motivation to collect silence serves as a strong, active vehicle for this arc. The epiphany feels slightly stated rather than purely dramatized, but the final decision to engage her father with the vial earns the character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Marcus displays "perfect emotional calibration," reading the passenger and environment without error or internal struggle, which flattens the dramatic tension. He functions more as a plot device than a flawed protagonist, lacking a moment of doubt or risk that would deepen the characterization beyond competent guide.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    Anya functions as a passive observer of history rather than an active protagonist; she faces no internal conflict, difficult choice, or temptation regarding the throne. Her emotional arc—curiosity to acceptance—is smooth and lacks the friction of a genuine dilemma or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.7)
    The protagonist is a static functionary of the setting, lacking present-tense internal contradiction or risk. Her competence is absolute, and her struggles are relegated to summarized backstory rather than dramatized through a difficult on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.6)
    Marina's agency is undermined by the reliance on text-message instructions to resolve the climax; she follows orders rather than making a difficult independent choice. The specific attribute "virtuously mischievous" appears only as an adverbial label in a dialogue tag rather than being demonstrated through behavior. While her motivation is stated, her emotional landscape relies on summary ("bitter and bright") rather than embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Victoria's arc from inheritor to destroyer is well-motivated by the dramatized visions of ancestral isolation. The internal shift is earned, culminating in a choice that values ignorance over painful knowledge, though the "gift" itself remains slightly abstract until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    Aldric is a consistent focalizer with legible interiority, though his emotional arc lacks friction. His surrender to the transformation feels inevitable rather than a hard-fought choice between competing values; the lack of hesitation or internal resistance to losing his humanity flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marcus is a clearly defined focalizer with a specific yearning, though the backstory regarding his ex-girlfriend Sarah feels somewhat functional and summarized rather than embodied. While his motivation to find his mother drives the scene, the internal conflict is mild; his choice to catalogue Timothy feels like a natural progression rather than a difficult decision forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mira fits the standard "underestimated rebel" archetype without subversion or internal contradiction; her "gift" for reading puddles feels like an unearned superpower rather than a skill. Jakob functions solely as an exposition device ("They're coming," "How did you know?"), lacking agency or distinct voice. The protagonist's dismissal of the leaders' arrest as a "perfect distraction" reads as emotionally flat rather than calculated.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus is a clearly defined focalizer with a consistent motivation and distinct role. However, his internal journey is static; he begins committed to the task and faces no internal temptation to play a note or doubt the cost, which limits the emotional complexity of the "un-performance."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Character agency is weak; Mira acts as a vessel for magical destiny rather than a person making difficult choices under pressure. Her decision to hide the speck is effortless, and the subsequent transformation is an unearned gift that resolves all internal tension without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer whose internal shift drives the narrative. However, the emotional climax relies on a summarized epiphany ("He understood then...") rather than a dramatized struggle, and the prompt-mandated motivation reads as diagnostic label-speak rather than embodied desire.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vera functions primarily as a mentor archetype delivering a prepared solution rather than a character struggling under pressure. While her backstory (gold-seamed face) adds texture, her interaction with Mira lacks friction; she arrives with the perfect magical cure and speech, removing the need for difficult on-page choices or emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    Character motivation is clear, but the emotional climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("Afraid that imperfection meant worthlessness") rather than embodied reaction. Mara's dialogue drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("integrate laughter into healing") that feels less like a character voice and more like an authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The protagonist's "proprioceptive" interiority is excellent, grounding her emotional arc in specific physical sensations and data. The shift from victim to healer is driven by her specific enhancements, though the emotional pivot feels slightly rapid given the depth of the initial trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira is a competent focalizer with a clear gift, but her journey in this scene lacks internal resistance or significant emotional cost. She accepts the call to action immediately and succeeds without a struggle that tests her flaws or values. The "unfastening" feels like a display of established competence rather than a crucible that demands a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Marcus is a distinct protagonist with a compelling specific competence (dust analysis). However, his climactic realization relies on an unearned intuitive leap ("Understanding flooded through him") rather than the established trait of observation, weakening his agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Moth is a distinct focalizer with a clear role, but her pivot from preserver (17 years of perfection) to destroyer feels slightly retroactive ("She understood now why she had been cryptic"). The internal conflict is resolved somewhat conveniently by destiny rather than an agonized choice between two active values, though the cost is high.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.7)
    Cassia’s motivation is clear and her background as a revolutionary effectively colors her archaeological perspective. However, her internal emotional landscape relies on stock phrasing ("familiar fire," "unshed tears"), and her competence feels slightly unearned as the solution comes too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elias acts as a static moral agent without internal contradiction or flaws, facing a cartoonishly evil antagonist in Vex. The characterization relies on archetypes rather than psychological depth, and the "wilting" sensation serves as a physical alert system rather than an emotional crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera’s motivation is clear, but the defining trait ("sensibly eccentric") acts as a static label that dictates the resolution rather than a source of active struggle. The psychometric ability appears conveniently to solve the mystery of the expedition without established cost or limitation, functioning more as a plot tool than an integrated skill.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.6)
    Marina functions as a vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted agent; her "perpetual learning" is stated rather than dramatized through struggle. The emotional arc is linear and smooth, lacking the internal contradiction or grit required for higher bands. Motivation is clear but low-stakes, as the "storm" acts as a helper rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mara is a vehicle for the concept rather than a dramatized protagonist. Her motivation is stated in summary ("quietly driven") rather than shown through struggle or contradictory desires in a scene. There is no internal conflict; she wants to paint, she paints, and she understands, with no emotional or relational cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Amara functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with agency; her compliance with Marcus’s instructions is immediate, lacking internal resistance or a temptation to misuse the diary. The emotional "tear" is stated rather than dramatized through behavior, leaving her interiority somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Silas is a clearly defined, competent protagonist, but he lacks internal contradiction or genuine vulnerability. His role is functional—the expert arriving to fix a problem—and while his motivation is stated, the emotional stakes of his "heresy" remain abstract backstory rather than felt pressure in the moment. The narrative treats him with a reverence that precludes the messy struggle or doubt that creates deep characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Matthias is a distinct, well-rendered protagonist whose specific expertise drives the narrative. His internal motivation—archiving emotional patterns—coheres beautifully with his actions, leading to a credible commitment at the climax. The "third grade memory" serves as a functional anchor for his worldview, though it leans slightly on backstory to explain his intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira functions as a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; she executes a prepared ritual without facing internal contradiction, doubt, or difficult choices. The lack of a "relationship as crucible" or personal flaw makes her success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but she lacks internal friction; her preference for "old ways" makes her choice to ring the bell feel inevitable rather than a hard-won decision under pressure. The descriptor "humble storm siren tester" reads as a clunky, authorial label rather than characterization through action. There is no personal cost or risk to her safety, lowering the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on summary and diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious," "devotion that bordered on prayer") rather than enacted traits. The epiphany is delivered through internal monologue that explains the emotion ("realized their vulnerability had become their greatest strength") instead of embodied reaction or costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mara is a distinct, grounded focalizer whose transition from survivalist to custodian of memory is well-motivated by the specific discoveries in the box. The internal conflict between the bitterness of the abandonment and the love for her grandfather is resolved through the acceptance of the "tangled promises," creating a strong emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    Marcus functions more as a narrative device than a character with agency; his "borrowed-time" nature is explained as backstory rather than dramatized through difficult on-page choices. He accepts the "grand design" without internal resistance or contradiction, making him a passive recipient of the climax rather than its driver.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    Mira functions as a static "wise woman" archetype rather than a character with genuine internal conflict or cost. She observes and dispenses wisdom without personal risk or struggle; the boy's immediate acceptance of her lesson feels convenient and unearned by the narrative interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s character arc is compelling; she reframes a terminal diagnosis from a tragedy into a functional tool for her work. The internalization of the "appointment" rather than "death sentence" demonstrates deep agency and stoicism. Her motivation is seamlessly welded to the plot's exigencies, making her sacrifice feel inevitable rather than melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist's defining trait ("academic rebellion") is stated in backstory but absent from the scene dynamics; she cooperates immediately without friction. The internal conflict relies on abstract labeling ("skepticism warring with evidence") rather than dramatized struggle, and the "luminous skepticism" descriptor feels like an imposed tag rather than a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.3)
    The coachman is a distinct, atmospheric presence with a clear vocation, but he functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character. He encounters no internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses during the scene; his certainty flattens the dramatic potential, leaving him as an efficient agent of the theme rather than a protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sage is a compelling focalizer with distinct interiority that balances canine instincts with the story's fable-like cognition. The shift from resignation to purpose is earned by the interaction with the cylinder, though the specific capability to read text via vibration relies on world-magic rather than a grounded character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kira functions more as a vessel for the plot's resolution than a character with conflicting impulses; her "pariah" status is established in backstory but lacks on-page social friction or cost. She accepts her role and succeeds without the internal struggle or hesitation that would deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Renn arrives with the solution already in hand, facing no significant internal doubt or struggle. While her actions are consistent with her established role, the lack of a difficult trade-off or genuine potential for failure makes her competence feel unearned and static.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina's motivation to document the "small gestures" is compelling and specifically grounded in her backstory as a "crisis actor," creating a strong internal engine. Her refusal of the visitor's offer is consistent with her established characterization, though the interiority occasionally leans on diagnostic phrasing (e.g., "benevolently ruthless") rather than purely embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The protagonist's motivation—escaping the pain of prophecy—is well-established, and the sensory details of her blindness ground her experience. However, the internal arc relies on a sudden, stone-induced epiphany ("She understood then") rather than a decision forced by escalating pressure. The choice to plant is meaningful, but the transition from seer to gardener feels more like a therapeutic realization than a high-stakes dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kaspar's internal conflict is clear, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("saw himself clearly... not a failure") rather than embodied emotion. The epiphany feels intellectually summarized rather than viscera earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kira is a functional protagonist who lacks internal friction or doubt; her victory is assured from the start, making her read more as a vehicle for the concept than a complex character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira's motivation to preserve history through sacrifice is clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, the required "uncertainty" reads as a superficial label ("hands trembled") that contradicts her "mechanical precision" and decisive actions, missing an opportunity for internal conflict to shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marina’s internal shift relies heavily on the journal’s exposition rather than an on-page struggle, effectively outsourcing her epiphany. Emotional states are frequently summarized with abstract labels ("confused grief and unexpected joy") rather than embodied through specific behavior or sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mara is defined clearly by longing, but her internal arc feels static; the "purification" of intention is asserted as backstory rather than dramatized as an on-page struggle. The resolution—Thomas returning because she asks correctly—undercuts her agency and creates a wish-fulfillment dynamic devoid of difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s internal conflict—the pull to migrate versus the duty to stay—is rendered with palpable weight. Her physical limitation (moon-phase weakness) creates immediate, embodied struggle that forces reliance on the tool, grounding her "patchwork" nature in action rather than just backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara is a distinct, compelled protagonist whose internal struggle is dramatized through specific, painful confessions. The transition from seeking a cure to accepting the burden of discretion is a well-earned psychological arc.

    Magnus is a compelling focalizer whose interiority is rendered with distinct, sensory metaphors ("trying on wet clothes"). His emotional arc—from professional curiosity to personal devastation and finally to a reconfigured peace—is coherent and moving. The realization regarding his son relies heavily on intuitive leaps, but the emotional logic holds firmly within his established isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Characterization is solid, establishing Marcus's inertia and regret effectively through his environment. However, the pivotal trait ("empirically intuitive nature") functions more as an expository label to facilitate the magical plot mechanics than as a dramatized quality that forces a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Seraphina's disenchantment ("crown and scepter feel like shackles") credibly motivates her acceptance of the transformation, framing it as a release rather than mere defeat. However, the rapidity of her surrender to the grotto's ultimatum limits the sense of active struggle or weighing of options in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lyra's motivation is clearly stated but intellectualized rather than deeply felt; her internal struggle is summarized ("spiraled into overthinking") rather than dramatized through friction. The relationship with Marcus functions as a convenient catalyst for epiphany rather than a source of genuine interpersonal pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s internal conflict—jealousy of her own variants and exhaustion with non-linear time—is compelling and distinct. The "insufferable expression" of her younger self adds specific, grounded characterization to a surreal concept, though her choices remain largely internal until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara possesses a near-telepathic empathy ("didn't need to ask") that bypasses the need for genuine investigative struggle or interaction. Her internal monologue relies on diagnostic label-speak ("fundamental sense," "emotional terrain") rather than embodied reaction, making her feel more like a thematic device than a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira's physical stress response creates excellent embodied stakes, grounding the magical elements in visceral cost. However, the climax hinges on a convenient memory ("boi") that delivers the solution fully formed, rather than Kira forging the answer through active decision-making in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s internal pivot from "ripping spirits" to "collaboration" is earned through sensory evidence and specific regret, showing clear character growth. The integration of her columnist persona with the exorcist role creates a unique, consistent voice that informs her worldview and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kaia functions effectively as a witness-protagonist, but her internal landscape is somewhat passive; the dictionary dictates her realizations rather than them emerging from a deep, embodied struggle. While her motivation is clear, the lack of significant personal resistance or distinct character-specific cost beyond the conceptual limits the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist’s internal landscape is rich, and the grandmother’s memory provides a solid, if slightly trope-dependent ("fingers trembled like bird bones"), motivational anchor. The character functions well as a vessel for the concept, but the absence of active, present-tense friction limits the depth of character revelation beyond the central philosophical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.1)
    Maya functions primarily as a thematic vessel; her reaction to a reality-breaking discovery (quantum fungi) lacks professional credibility, pivoting instantly to relationship metaphors. The emotional arc feels unearned due to the rapid shift from scientific observation to sentimental reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is clear, but the stranger functions as a transparent plot device rather than a character. The stranger's dialogue is diagnostic ("You teach probability while knowing it's a comfort blanket"), explaining Elena's psychology to her in a way that feels like the author inserting a thesis statement rather than organic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marcus functions as a vessel for the premise rather than a living character; his motivation is authorially stated ("This was his method") and his contentment lacks the friction of genuine internal conflict or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal conflict is rendered with high specificity, and her solution (the micro-codicil) perfectly synthesizes her professional skills with her moral need. The "haunted euphoria" moment relies slightly on diagnostic labeling, but her agency and the embodiment of her "gentle thoroughness" are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    Characterization relies on archetypes and summary rather than dramatized complexity. Sadie reads as a functional "Manic Pixie" device, defined by labels ("extraordinaire," "ghost") rather than behavior, while Marcus is passive, "taking the bait" and complying without the internal struggle required to earn his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elara lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she functions as a competent vessel for the premise rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure. The realization at the end feels like a scheduled arrival rather than an earned insight born of resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s internal conflict between guilt and scientific integrity is palpable, driving the narrative effectively. While the "confidently uncertain" trait feels slightly inserted as a label rather than purely demonstrated, her final choice to relinquish control authentically culminates her arc. The connection to the grandfather provides a functional, if slightly convenient, emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    Character emotion is often labeled ("joyful sorrow") rather than embodied in action or visceral sensation. The dynamic between Maya and Chen lacks friction or status shifts, resulting in a static relationship despite their history.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The protagonist's motivation to destroy forgeries to save history is compelling, but her agency is undermined by the "genetic memory" explanation, which solves the central puzzle for her. The trait "analytically intuitive" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a difficult intellectual struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but she functions more as a vehicle for the plot than a nuanced character. Her internal state lacks friction; she faces dissolution with a serene certainty that lowers tension. The "dying" aspect feels like a label rather than a felt, embodied constraint that forces difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus is a distinct, competent protagonist, but his lack of internal conflict or struggle limits the score. He begins and ends as the master of his domain, acting as a guide rather than a character under pressure who must change or sacrifice significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira functions as a magical plot device rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction or struggle. Thomas remains passive throughout, receiving an unearned epiphany without making a difficult choice or paying a visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dialogue feels performed and didactic rather than embodied, particularly the eight-year-old child articulating complex thematic theses ("I want to learn to think") without age-appropriate texture. The characters function primarily as mouthpieces for the story's moral, lacking contradictory internal impulses or genuine hesitation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    Mira’s physical characterization ("moved like water") is grounded, but her internal transition is rushed; the shift from guarded survival to total vulnerability relies on summary rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mrs. Chen's progression from passive observer to active practitioner is handled with subtle precision, creating a complete arc within the short scope. The suppression of emotion is not just a trait but an active, difficult choice shown in the final dialogue ("words fell flat"), demonstrating a felt cost for her survival.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.7)
    Silas lacks internal conflict or doubt; his "tremor of certainty" arrives mid-story and removes psychological stakes. He functions as a competent vehicle for the concept rather than a character making difficult trade-offs with visible costs. The realization at the end is stated as a thematic summary rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.8)
    Mira functions as a static catalyst who fixes Enzo without facing internal conflict or personal cost; her ability to deduce his daughter's history from a shaking hand strains credibility. The "colorblind" connection between the women feels like a convenient contrivance rather than a deepened character link.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Vera functions more as a thematic vehicle than a pressured agent; her shift from ritualist to improvisor happens without resistance or internal struggle. The epiphany triggered by the lens is immediate and convenient, lacking the "blind spots" or conflicting impulses required for a higher score. The emotional arc is smooth rather than earned through genuine psychological friction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elena’s interiority is well-rendered, grounding the grief in the specific tremors of her hands and her craft. The shift from wedding rings to memorial pieces serves as a strong, embodied character trait. However, the stranger functions more as a thematic mirror than a distinct individual, limiting the scene's dynamic range to affirmation rather than challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    Vera functions as a competent professional solving a puzzle, but lacks the internal contradiction or difficult choices required for higher bands. Her "steadily curious" nature is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a decision that carries cost or risk. The interaction with Marcus is purely transactional and expository, lacking status dynamics or emotional friction. The character serves the concept rather than the concept testing the character.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Character motivation is distinct and drives the plot; the physical cost of the "unpredictable" movement and the final absorption is visceral and well-dramatized. The internal struggle with the alien memories adds necessary depth to the "heist" archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira functions primarily as an observer; her interiority relies heavily on adjectival labeling ("luminous regret") rather than conflicting drives or embodied emotion. While her final choice to become a chronicler is clear, the path there lacks the friction of genuine internal struggle; her reactions (gasps, tears) feel somewhat staged.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina's motivation to reclaim integrity is clear and drives the action. However, interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic summary during peak beats ("ego and fear had corrupted her purpose," "facades falling away"), which distances the reader slightly from embodied emotion. The realization of her own complicity is earned, but the articulation feels slightly rehearsed.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maya is a distinct, compelled protagonist; her decision to drill tunnels into her scars is a radical, specific choice that drives the narrative. The shift from seeking closure to accepting "openness" is well-charted, though the telepathic "download" of information from the plants slightly dampens her active struggle in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s interiority is rich and guides the narrative, with a clear micro-choice (stealing the film vs. reporting it) grounded in her character. However, her emotional reactions occasionally lean into performative sentimentality ("hushed thunder of her own heartbeat") rather than distinct personality traits.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Lyra functions more as a vessel for the plot than a character with agency; she follows instructions from the stars without internal resistance or doubt. The climax relies on a "thought that wasn't quite her own," robbing her of the decisive moment and reducing her sacrifice to a passive event. While her motivation is clear, the lack of contradictory impulses or hesitation makes the emotional arc feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kess is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear voice, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her victory over the pirate is achieved through established competence rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice, leaving her static.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a person, lacking specific interiority or contradictory impulses. His journey is frictionless; he experiences "sudden clarity" rather than earning insight through struggle or difficult choices. There is no internal conflict, only a linear progression from amnesia to restoration via a magical object.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marina's emotional arc is passive; the guides diagnose her condition ("Unused courage waits...") rather than letting her demonstrate it through struggle. The protagonist's realization is handed to her in dialogue, reducing the internal friction and cost of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marcus is a grounded focalizer with a compelling physical arc—his regenerating nerves parallel the fortress's awakening. His motivation to witness the "cost of safety" provides a solid, if slightly abstract, anchor for his endurance. While he primarily observes until the final gesture, the physical specificity of his frostbite gives his internal experience distinct texture. The choice to keep the bolt creates a clear bridge between backstory and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.7)
    Syln functions effectively as a stoic archetype ("the humble guardian"), but her internal landscape feels static. While her historical weight is established well, she lacks the contradictory impulses or visible emotional struggle required for higher bands; her choices feel inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lena's motivation to decode the past is grounded in specific action (tapping), and the connection to her grandmother provides solid agency. However, her pivotal realization relies on internal summary ("Lena finally understood") rather than embodied reaction, distancing the reader at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Kira is functional but defined primarily by labels ("awkwardly confident") rather than contradictory impulses or costly choices. The transition from awkwardness to "ancient and sure" feels asserted by the narration rather than earned through a dramatized internal struggle or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Grandmother Chen is a distinct focalizer with a clear, active motivation. However, the antagonist (the lieutenant) functions as a prop; his immediate conversion at the climax is unearned by character dynamics and relies entirely on the plot device, stripping the conflict of interpersonal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is deep and embodied, particularly the "practiced intention" of freezing, which flips a typical trauma response into agency. The diagnostic language ("somatic markers," "nervous system") risks clinical distancing but is successfully grounded in the character's history with Dr. Mansour.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marina's internal state—grief intertwined with artistic block—is compelling and clearly embodied. The shift from fear to acceptance is rapid but earned through the pressure of the setting, though the epiphany relies slightly on abstract realization rather than purely dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.6)
    The protagonist is defined primarily by labels ("serene anger," "consciously wild") rather than dramatized impulses or difficult choices. She functions as a passive observer of the phenomenon; while her internal motivation is clear, she faces no resistance that tests her character or forces a revelation through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera's motivation is clear and her agency drives the plot to a high-cost resolution. However, the internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized, relying on the diagnostic tell "bravely conflicted" to define her state. The shift from loyal archivist to traitor feels swift given the twelve-year tenure, lacking a specific on-page micro-choice before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.1)
    Characterization relies on idealized archetypes rather than psychological depth; Mira is a flawless thematic vessel without internal contradiction. The father’s rapid transition from killer to gardener lacks friction or earned emotional logic, resolving complex trauma with a single interaction. Motivation is stated in abstract terms ("weaving continuity") rather than dramatized through difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kova is a competent, consistent protagonist whose internal discipline (“voicing silence”) drives the action. Her motivation is high-concept but established, though her emotional interiority remains somewhat distant until the final integration. The "cool-headed" trait is dramatized well through her suppression of panic during the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Margot’s internal conflict between the lawyer's denial, the truth, and the necessary lie is compelling and clearly dramatized. Her decision to craft a third story is an active, character-defining choice that reveals her priorities (power/stasis over honesty). The "goodbye kiss to honesty" feels slightly performative, but fits the established persona.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mara is a functionary rather than a character; she possesses absolute competence and faces no internal doubt, temptation, or conflicting desire. Her "gift" and the time loop remove the need for difficult decisions, leaving a protagonist who enacts a ritual rather than struggling against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    Seraphina is distinct and her background as a street artist grounds her actions effectively. However, her pivotal realization is received passively through a magical object rather than earned through active struggle or decision-making. The attribute "socially perceptive" feels like an authorial label inserted to justify her connection to the cave, rather than an organic trait driving behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sarai’s internal struggle between restoration and transformation is well-delineated, and her backstory of "aberrant mercy" provides strong motivation. However, her primary conflict is resolved partly by external validation (the stones explicitly naming/accepting her) rather than a purely internal realization, which slightly diminishes her agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cornelius is a consistent focalizer with a vivid internal landscape, but he lacks agency in the inciting incident (the coin is simply "brought" to him) and faces no internal resistance during the climax. He functions more as a vehicle for the magic system than a character making difficult trade-offs; his desire is singular and met without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    Maya’s internal landscape relies heavily on the "somatic markers" label rather than dramatized struggle. David’s transition from "insane" to "participatory wonder" is frictionless, lacking the resistance or status shifts that characterize genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kira functions primarily as a sensory vehicle for the concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses or flaws. Her acceptance of the new role is immediate, lacking the internal friction or reluctance that would earn the emotional shift and deepen the characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara functions as a cipher for the concept rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, and her immediate, frictionless acceptance of the paradigm shift misses the opportunity for earned emotional cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Margot is a coherent focalizer, but her emotional pivot from deep betrayal to total acceptance is too rapid and lacks sufficient friction. The transition relies on summary realization ("Margot understood now") rather than a dramatized testing of Viktor's claim, making the reconciliation feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The protagonist is a static functionary with no internal conflict; the passenger is a passive recipient of magical aid who lacks agency. The relationship is transactional rather than dramatic, missing the "crucible" of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mei is a consistent, atmospherically grounded protagonist whose potter's background effectively colors her perception. However, her agency is limited to observation and movement; she lacks internal contradiction or a high-stakes dilemma that would force a difficult, character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    Marina is portrayed with consistency, but her internal landscape lacks the friction required for higher bands; she moves from "wistfully pragmatic certainty" to action without genuine struggle or contradiction. Her benevolence (Mrs. Chen, the Morrison kids) feels idealized, rendering her more a vehicle for the theme than a flawed, striving protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    Kira is conceptually distinct but operates primarily as a vessel for the premise rather than a living consciousness under pressure. The dialogue with Marcus feels didactic, articulating themes rather than revealing character through subtext or friction. The "mammoth herder" identity is told through backstory summary rather than shown through distinct behavioral tics or choices in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira's internal landscape is rich with the "architecture of longing," but her central conflict—the fear of revealing her own heart—dissolves too easily upon Chen's arrival. The transition from secret-keeper to vulnerable collaborator lacks the friction or hesitation that would prove the weight of her past silence. Her "whimsy" is asserted by the narration rather than dramatized through costly, idiosyncratic choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    Maya functions as a plot device rather than a fully realized character; her "trembling fingers" and "grim smile" are stock physical cues that substitute for genuine interiority. The narrative relies on her competence, but her internal conflict is nonexistent, reducing her to a technician flipping switches rather than a protagonist making hard choices with personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marcus is a consistent focalizer with a clear trait (claustrophobia) that informs his preparation ("prudently adventurous"). However, the internal conflict resolves too smoothly; his phobia evaporates the moment the music starts, turning a potential struggle into a passive realization. The transformation feels asserted via the narrator's summary ("something altogether more paradoxical had returned") rather than earned through a difficult, high-cost choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The protagonist's prosopagnosia is a compelling hook that organically drives her unique investigative method. Motivation is clear, but the climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("identity disorders") rather than dramatized behavioral insight, which renders the resolution slightly clinical.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara is a functional protagonist with clear agency, but her internal state relies heavily on abstract labeling ("idealistic certainty," "nervously confident") rather than embodied emotion. While her dedication to the legacy is clear, the shift to "inherited responsibility" feels slightly rushed, asserted rather than earned through a difficult on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.7)
    Marla's internal conflicts (running from home, music vs. marriage) are presented as a summary list rather than dramatized emotional obstacles. Her primary realization is delivered via the hitchhiker's exposition rather than through a hard-won internal struggle, making her agency feel reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marcus is a compelling archetype with a consistent voice, but he functions more as a static device than a struggling protagonist. He faces no genuine internal conflict, vulnerability, or risk of failure; he executes his plan with superior ease from start to finish, which flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mira and Hayashi are distinct, but Mira's core trait ("healing with words") is applied to the plot in a confusing, metaphorical way—it is unclear how speech therapy skills allow one to decode variable star light curves. This makes her competence feel unearned. The emotional progression to acceptance is smooth but lacks internal friction; the "burden" is stated rather than felt through resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kael's internal pivot from seeking exoneration to accepting the burden of a lie is a compelling, high-agency choice. The "warlike serenity" trait feels slightly repetitive as a label, but his competence and willingness to pay a reputational price drive the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira functions more as a vehicle for the prompt's concepts than a complex character; her primary trait ("root-bound") is stated rather than dramatized through struggle. She faces no internal opposition or temptation to ignore the call, resulting in a protagonist who obeys rather than chooses. The ending validation feels earned by compliance rather than personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara is clearly motivated, and the backstory reveal (she burned the card herself) provides strong agency. However, the characterization leans heavily on telling via prompt labels ("reckless with her ideals," "fiercely gentle") rather than fully dramatizing these traits through difficult choices before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict and professional background are vivid, but his emotional pivot relies on a massive coincidence (finding his own band's gear) rather than agency or skill. This reliance on serendipity undercuts the "earned" nature of his recovered confidence, as the solution is gifted rather than achieved through the established struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.7)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("kindly methodical," "haunted ambitions") rather than demonstrating these traits through struggle in the scene. The central choice feels inevitable rather than hard-won, as the counter-weight (her quiet apartment life) is abstract and briefly summarized rather than felt as a genuine temptation. The protagonist functions as a competent archetype rather than a specific, contradictory individual under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    Kaine is visually distinct and her "flux" nature is intriguing, but she functions primarily as a static guide rather than a protagonist under pressure. The visitor is an archetype without sufficient interiority to make her transformation feel earned; her conflict is summarized in a list of past selves rather than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s internal conflict is legible, but the pivotal shift from professional inspector to vulnerable confessor relies on a rapid backstory dump (mother, Marcus) rather than earned scene pressure. The transition feels functional to serve the plot rather than psychologically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist with a specific obsession (the river chronicles) that grounds his internal conflict. However, the pivotal emotional shift—from five years of frozen guilt to "raw solace"—relies on a rapid, slightly convenient epiphany triggered by the graffiti rather than a fully dramatized internal struggle. The change feels narratively mandated rather than viscerally earned in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a specific individual; she lacks contradictory impulses or distinct interiority beyond the functional needs of the plot. Her primary action is compliance with the cipher's instructions, resulting in a journey devoid of difficult, defining choices or personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear and the internal conflict (empire vs. truth) is legible, but agency is diluted by the divination mechanic. Because Elara sees the "blueprint" of the outcome in advance, her decision feels more like following a script than making a high-stakes gamble under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira's dual role is a strong conceptual anchor, and her motivation is clear. However, her internal landscape is somewhat static; she functions more as an archetype than a conflicted individual, with the realization of her purpose delivered as summary rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mara functions as a passive vessel for the theme rather than an active protagonist; she climbs a tree and receives an epiphany from a magical figure without engaging in significant struggle or choice. The attribute "kindly decisive" is applied as a label in exposition rather than demonstrated through a high-pressure decision on the page. Her internal conflict regarding the scrolls is resolved by external affirmation rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrator is a distinct, voice-driven presence with a clear professional ethos, though Marcus functions largely as a reactive sounding board for the lesson. The dialogue occasionally slips into diagnostic label-speak ("Children raised on absolute morality break..."), which flattens the emotional reality into a case study rather than a lived crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara is a compelling, consistent archetype with a distinct worldview, but she lacks the internal contradictory impulses acting in-scene required for higher bands. Her role is static (the wise guide) rather than dynamic under pressure, limiting the emotional complexity of her on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Yula is a consistent focalizer, but her characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("historically reverent nature") and backstory summary rather than active struggle in the present. Her defining trait—stillness—renders her static; the "choice" to respond to the echo is a confirmation of mastery rather than a decision forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s internal conflict is legible, but her emotional arc resolves too smoothly via epiphany, lacking the grit of contradictory impulses in the climactic moment. The transition from despair to laughter feels gestural rather than earned by a struggle on the page. The renunciation of the medallion is a strong initial choice, but the subsequent "soft reset" of her worldview happens without further psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marlow possesses agency and a clear objective, but her internal arc is resolved too easily by external exposition (the journal) rather than genuine struggle. The emotional pivot—from searching to total acceptance of a supernatural reality—occurs instantly without the friction or resistance that characterizes deep characterization. The "cost" of the vows is stated ("no longer hide") rather than felt through a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voss functions more as a philosophical vessel than a living character; her interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("cognitive dissonance," "stellar doubt") rather than embodied reaction to pressure. The emotional arc is static—she moves from certainty to reinforced certainty without a dramatized moment of vulnerability, resistance, or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character motivation is anchored in a specific backstory that colors the present moment effectively. Interiority is strong, though the climactic beat relies on somewhat diagnostic labeling ("I name you Absence") rather than a visceral choice, making the resolution feel slightly therapeutic rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira is defined by labels ("mediocre," "lukewarm") that are contradicted by her effortless success in the scene. She faces no internal doubt or genuine obstacle during the ritual, resulting in a flat trajectory where competence is stated rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus's shift from technical warden to historian is well-motivated by the discovery, though the phrase "instinct he couldn't name" relies on a cliché placeholder for interiority. The emotional connection to the backstory anchors the change in stance effectively, creating a clear internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vera’s motivation is legible, but her internal conflict is resolved conveniently by external signals (the birds) rather than deep struggle. The trait "secretly sentimental" is explicitly told rather than emerging purely through behavior, though the final closure choice supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    Maya’s defining trait as a "pattern seeker" clashes with the pivotal beat where she "understands immediately" and trusts an unidentified voice based solely on breathing. A character defined by rigorous observation should verify the caller’s identity before committing treason, making this leap of faith feel unearned and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's internal numbness is well-established, though the transition to acceptance relies heavily on Master Chen's exposition rather than purely internal discovery. The "terror" of feeling nothing is a strong, embodied motivation that grounds the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.3)
    Mira functions as a competency archetype rather than a character under pressure; she experiences immediate understanding ("She recognized it now," "She understood") rather than struggle or doubt. Her internal state is conveyed through abstract summaries of realization rather than embodied conflict or contradictory impulses. The lack of personal cost or difficult choices leaves her static.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marcus functions as a magical catalyst rather than a character under pressure; he faces no internal opposition, decision-making friction, or risk of failure. The trait "mournfully eager" appears as a static label rather than a driver of difficult choices, and his success requires no visible personal cost or transformation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The protagonist's internal landscape of homesickness is rendered with visceral detail ("hollow spaces"), grounding the emotional arc. However, the transition from "feral guardian" to cooperative guide lacks friction; the creaturely instincts established in the opening yield too instantly to the pendant's signal, missing an opportunity for internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus's internal landscape is well-drawn, particularly the detail of his sensitivity serving as armor. However, his defining trait of "hopelessness" is asserted more than dramatized, and his pivotal internal shift relies on summarized epiphany rather than a pressured, on-page emotional struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya is a competent focalizer with clear motivation, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene. Her final decision to "tune her life differently" feels like a standard genre trope rather than a choice forged under pressure, as the cost of the alternative (selling to the Guild) is abstract and theoretical rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    Marcus functions more as a plot device than a character under pressure. His motivation ("to merge parallel timelines") is delivered via late-stage exposition rather than dramatized need, and his defining trait ("resiliently positive") appears as a label rather than a tested attribute that shapes difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motivation is clear and drives the scene, but the character functions more as a concept vehicle than a person. Internal conflict is minimal; she executes her task with competence but without a distinct moment of doubt or difficult choice that reveals character depth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    Characterization relies on role performance rather than internal life; Elara functions as a vehicle for the lesson without contradictory impulses or personal stakes. Emotions are delivered via abstract labels ("somber marvel") rather than embodied reaction or difficult choice. The lack of interpersonal friction or internal cost leaves the protagonist static.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on essayistic self-definition ("detective of the departed") rather than embodied emotional struggle. The epiphany regarding "incidental heroism" feels author-inserted to satisfy a prompt rather than a natural psychological output of the pressure she faces.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elena’s claustrophobia adds effective visceral texture to the internal conflict, grounding the abstract duty of memory in physical struggle. However, the backstory of the "digital cancer" is delivered via external exposition rather than character agency, slightly distancing the emotional realization from her active deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus creates a compelling figure of isolation, anchored by the tactile counting of heartbeats. However, the sudden pivot to "teaching others" at the closure feels unearned by the scene's solitary, mystical pressure; it resolves a deeply personal existential crisis with a generic external goal that diminishes the unique "ghost" bond established.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The protagonist is an effective mythic vessel for the story's concept, consistent in her "copper-veined" nature. However, she functions more as an archetypal operator than a psychologically deep character; her interiority is sensory rather than conflicted, and the cost of her final transformation is narrated in summary rather than felt in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    Marina's motivation regarding her brother anchors the ending, but her mid-scene epiphany ("Marina understood suddenly") bypasses genuine internal struggle or deduction. The transition from skepticism to full commitment feels rushed, relying on asserted intuition rather than a dramatized shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lira is a clear, active protagonist whose agency drives the plot. The internal "gap" between knowing and cost provides a solid anchor for her decision to sacrifice herself for the orchard. However, her competence is high and the struggle remains largely external until the final endurance beat; a moment of deeper internal doubt or a specific, dramatized cost earlier in the scene would heighten the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.2)
    Ezra functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character with agency; he faces no contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. His actions are safe and predetermined, lacking the "visible cost" required for high-band characterization. The trait "respectfully rebellious" is asserted as a label rather than dramatized through a difficult choice against pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Emil is drawn with consistent melancholy, but his pivotal action—entering the garden—is driven by an external "pull" and a stumble rather than active agency. The emotional shift from seven years of silence to sudden song feels unearned by on-page struggle or internal resistance; the "impulse" does the heavy lifting for him.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    The protagonist is clearly defined but static, functioning more as a vessel for the concept than a character with internal contradictions or distinct micro-choices. Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through struggle, and the "eccentric" persona relies on backstory labels rather than active behavior under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mara’s motivation is established, but the climax relies on diagnostic internalization ("spending her own capacity") rather than embodied sensation, abstracting the emotional cost. The internal conflict is resolved through sudden realization rather than a dramatized struggle between contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    Vera functions as a flat archetype with no internal contradiction or genuine psychological struggle. Her defining trait ("unassumingly bold") is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice between competing values. She overcomes the central obstacle with "practiced patience" and innate competence, lacking a moment of doubt or significant emotional cost to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Margaret is competent and her motivation is clear, grounded in a specific history with Gran. However, the emotional climax relies on summary ("Margaret understood now") and labeling ("familiar thrill") rather than dramatized internal struggle. The burden of the dark memories is accepted with a swift resolve that feels slightly unearned by the prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara and Kess are distinct, with Elara's "walking backwards" tic serving as a functional, if slightly quirky, character detail. However, Kess’s emotional pivot from aggressive skepticism ("dangling hope like a weapon") to collaborative student occurs too rapidly, lacking sufficient on-page resistance or friction to earn the shift in dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    Mira functions as an archetype rather than a character, lacking internal conflict, flaws, or doubt. Her primary challenge is resolved via backstory ("answer had come to her in dreams") rather than active ingenuity in the moment, leaving her with no difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mira is a competent archetype who performs a ritual with expertise, but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses on the page. Her motivation is clear ("whispers"), yet she faces no meaningful resistance or choice that tests her character, resulting in a flat trajectory where competence replaces struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a competent, proactive protagonist whose professional skills drive the narrative. However, the internal arc relies on "telling" via labels ("methodically curious nature," "guarded expression") rather than purely dramatized behavior. The pivotal moment of self-realization involves a cliché mirror-gazing beat that externalizes an internal shift too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marina is a competent protagonist with legible interiority, though her "colleague" relationship with death is told through summary rather than dramatized via difficult choices. The lack of distinct high-stakes struggle keeps the characterization functional rather than deeply compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.5)
    Chorus is a competent, empathetic archetype who faces no internal contradiction or genuine flaws. Her journey is one of smooth discovery; she encounters no resistance from the monks or the machine that forces a difficult trade-off or character-defining choice. The lack of struggle leaves her feeling more like a narrative function than a fully realized protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mira functions primarily as a decoder for the backstory rather than a fully realized protagonist. Her ability to read the captain's specific shorthand is a convenient coincidence rather than an earned skill, and her internal journey mirrors the discovered text too neatly without generating independent friction or conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena's obsession is palpably rendered, and her choice to remain untethered demonstrates a clear hierarchy of values (work over safety). The connection to her predecessor provides strong motivation, though the refusal of rescue—a key defining action—is summarized rather than dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyra's interiority is consistent, but her agency is limited to executing a pre-determined plan using a found map; the "discovery" of limits is summarized rather than dramatized through struggle. The prosopagnosia serves more as a thematic superpower than a constraint that forces difficult trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)
    Elara functions primarily as an observer rather than a protagonist under pressure; her internal state lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The "diligently curious" trait appears as a label to justify her presence rather than a driver of difficult choices, and her "madness" for choosing isolation is stated but not dramatized with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's motivation to repair her past failure is clear, and her shift from forcing locks to "listening" is a legible arc. However, this realization is driven primarily by reading instructional prophecy scraps rather than through an on-page crucible or pressure-forced choice, making the internal change feel slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The protagonist is a cipher whose interiority is limited to "collective purpose" and "fading," lacking the required contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The narrative functions as a fable with flat archetypes (the Wise Grandmother, the Scientist) rather than a dramatized character study under pressure. There is no agonizing choice; Marina simply persists until she succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marcus serves primarily as a vessel for the lyrical concept rather than an agent with distinct interiority. His transformation is instantaneous upon touching the object, lacking a dramatized struggle or specific personal cost beyond the abstract acceptance of a "burden."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara is a compelling protagonist with a complex internal conflict between freedom and duty. Her motivation for staying—anchored by the seed's potential rather than just the curse—adds depth to her sacrifice. The paradoxical logic of her freedom binding her more tightly than the curse is a sophisticated character beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Marina's internal landscape is well-rendered through the lens of her profession, blending chemistry and music convincingly. The shift in her perspective is grounded in established traits ("symphonically minded nature"), though the emotional release ("grief... began to loosen") feels slightly accelerated to fit the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Merrick's internal conflict—between selling absence and understanding the voids—resolves beautifully through the interaction with the child. The child's motivation is distinct, poignant, and drives the central pivot, resulting in a character arc that feels earned and transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    Miran functions more as a vessel for the premise than a fully realized character; her "sturdy" nature is asserted to justify her survival rather than demonstrated through struggle. The internal conflict is resolved via a sudden upgrade in ability—shifting from "sandpapering" to "metabolizing" centuries of grief—which feels unearned. The lack of a visible toll or character-specific flaw dampens the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.3)
    The protagonist lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions as a perfect catalyst rather than a character under pressure. The attribute "empathetically decisive" is inserted as a diagnostic label rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Motivation is noble but static, meeting no internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.3)
    Vera functions more as a thematic vehicle than a character under pressure; her internal state is described through abstract scientific metaphors rather than embodied emotion. She encounters no resistance or meaningful choice; the transformation is a smooth, inevitable procedure rather than a struggle, leaving the "profound transformation" feeling theoretical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orin is a competent protagonist whose "prism-mind" serves as an effective navigational tool, though it functions more as a magical key than a source of internal conflict. The motivation of vigilance is clear and drives the plot, but the emotional interiority feels somewhat functional, relying on repetitive realization beats ("Orin understood") rather than embodied struggle. The final choice to perpetuate the cycle earns a solid resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mira functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, doubt, or competing desires. Her competence is absolute, and she faces no difficult choices or meaningful psychological pressure during the process. The "empathy in motion" trait is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a struggle that tests her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Viktor is a consistent focalizer with a clear worldview, but his internal struggle feels resolved before the scene begins; he preaches wisdom rather than earning it through present-tense conflict. The choice to stay feels inevitable rather than hard-won, reducing the emotional weight of the "covenant" ending. The relationship with Mira functions more as a vehicle for thematic exposition than a messy, pressure-filled interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mara’s motivation is clear, and her interiority as a sound collector is well-rendered. However, her success feels inevitable; she encounters no significant internal resistance or contradictory impulses, and the resolution requires no difficult trade-off or emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mira’s motivation is clear, but her progression from ambitious novice to enlightened master is largely summarized rather than dramatized in high-pressure scenes. The internal shift is reported through time-lapses ("Days dissolved into weeks") rather than earned through a specific, costly choice in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kessa functions as a competent vehicle for the plot rather than a character under pressure; she faces no internal contradictions and succeeds without personal cost or sacrifice. Her interiority is largely observational, and her primary motivation serves the external plot without generating friction against personal desires or fears.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya is competent and professional, but her interiority feels somewhat functional, serving as a camera for the phenomenon rather than a site of deep conflict. The connection to Morrison provides a necessary emotional anchor, but her "crystallization" of understanding feels rapid and lacks a visceral on-page struggle before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lyrian is a functional archetype rather than a fully realized character. She lacks internal contradiction or doubt; her motivation is singular and unwavering, and she faces no difficult choices that test her values. The narrative treats her as a vessel for the solution rather than a protagonist navigating a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kessa is consistent but lacks active internal conflict in the scene; her primary struggle is summarized in backstory ("desperation had driven her"), leaving the present moment without a dilemma. The realization is recalled rather than earned through immediate pressure, resulting in a character who executes a pre-formed plan rather than making a difficult choice under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira is defined primarily by her function and the abstract concept of her empathy rather than specific, grounded choices. The conflict between borrowed personalities ("merchant's pragmatism wrestled with a child's wonder") is summarized as a list of labels rather than dramatized through contradictory actions or distinct internal voices battling for control.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    Elara functions primarily as a vessel for the plot rather than an agent of change. Her defining trait (the tremor) resolves the central mystery through a convenient physical coincidence—matching the frequency—rather than through a difficult decision or internal conquest. The emotional arc is resolved by an external "knowledge flood" rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.1)
    Vera functions as a vehicle for the premise rather than a character under pressure; she experiences immediate success without internal conflict or sacrifice. Her emotions are described with labels ("grandmother's grief," "triumph") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or enacted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mei’s desperate motivation is visceral, and the ultimate renunciation—trading her identity for her daughter’s safety—is an impactful, earned change. While the transition from discovery to mastery relies on rapid internal processing rather than interaction, the emotional logic of the sacrifice holds the character arc together firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    Korin is a competent archetype rather than a complex character; his "meekness" is asserted via labels ("quiet determination," "listening") rather than tested by difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s sensory interiority is vivid, but her emotional transition at the climax is frictionless; she shifts from discovering her life’s work is destructive to proposing a perfect solution without creating a sense of processed horror.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    Elsa accepts a lifetime of supernatural servitude with diagnostic ease ("She could be alone without becoming lonely").

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    Mira functions as a capable operator of the premise rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction, flaws, or competing desires. The pivotal emotional shift ("shadowed elation") is labeled rather than embodied through action or sensory detail. Her acceptance of the mirror-twin is immediate and frictionless, devoid of the reluctance or struggle that creates character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Kael’s internal state as a transplant survivor is grounded and evocative, blending physical sensation with metaphysical unease. However, his agency is limited; he functions primarily as a recipient of wisdom rather than an active driver of the scene. The emotional arc resolves smoothly through the mentor’s explanation rather than through Kael grappling with a difficult, on-page choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus is a competent focalizer, but his internal arc relies on a convenient epiphany ("understood suddenly") rather than earned struggle. The "healing hands" attribute is established but remains ornamental, never forcing a difficult choice or enabling a unique tactic that drives the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara functions as a clear focalizer with legible motivation, but her emotional arc traces a linear path from despair to triumph without significant internal resistance or contradiction. The transition from "trying everything" to the sudden success of the song feels unearned by on-page struggle; the arrival of the survivors is convenient, reducing the pressure on her individual agency to hold the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("gift and curse," "keenly empathetic") rather than embodied sensory experience. While motivation is consistent, the interiority feels summarized and slightly clichéd rather than idiosyncratic to a specific psyche under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    Lila accepts magical events without struggle or contradictory impulses, lacking the internal conflict required for depth. The "cursed awareness" is defined by labels rather than felt cost, functioning as a convenient superpower rather than a burden.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara’s transition from a cold administrator to a passionate custodian is well-earned. Her internal state effectively mirrors the setting’s frozen control, and the final vow demonstrates a satisfying, character-driven shift in values.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mae’s internal landscape is compelling; the specific, sensory-driven motivation ("capture the sound of trust breaking") distinguishes her from a generic agent. The choice to unmask herself to provoke a reaction is a strong agency beat that merges character flaw and professional duty. However, the antagonist’s reaction ("finishing his work") feels slightly too convenient, softening the realism of the criminal dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    Skepticism is outsourced to the implants, making the internal state performative rather than felt. The protagonist's conversion is instantaneous upon seeing the evidence, lacking the friction or cost of dismantling a lifelong worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Vera's agency drives the plot, culminating in a high-stakes choice to dismantle the city's peace.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.7)
    Mariel functions more as a vessel for the plot than an agent of active discovery; her solution arrives via a "dream" rather than through on-page struggle or competence. While her desire is clear, she faces no internal conflict or moment of doubt, executing the preservation ritual without error or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    M-47 is a cohesive focalizer, blending synthetic constraints with the prompt’s organic requirements effectively. The internal transition from "abandonment" to "trust" is earned through the ritualistic action of the burn rather than just stated. The emotional "longing" feels slightly generic for the AI archetype, but the specific interaction with the fears grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.3)
    Marta is a functional vehicle for the plot rather than a character with internal conflict; her "curator" persona is stated but not tested. Elena’s recovery from catatonia to articulation is instantaneous upon touching the locket, lacking earned emotional progression or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya is a distinct, competent protagonist whose agency drives the narrative; she actively solves the puzzle rather than observing it.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    Marina's interiority regarding the "hollow" memory of her daughter is compelling and grounded. However, the epiphany regarding the city founders' specific surgical history feels like an unearned knowledge leap; she deduces complex societal backstory instantly from a single visual cue, turning interiority into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The protagonist's ethical stance—sacrificing positive futures ("loves that would never bloom") to ensure peace—creates a compelling, complex worldview. Her solitude is effectively drawn, though the "decades of communion" feels slightly more told than shown through specific, idiosyncratic behaviors.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s internal landscape is coherent, blending her profession with her obsession effectively. However, the "patiently nimble" attribute feels inserted rather than organic to the moment, and Marcus functions primarily as a foil to unlock her exposition rather than exerting distinct pressure. The emotional stakes of their connection remain gentle, lacking the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    Marina is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("tragically radiant," "incandescent with grief") rather than dramatized behavior. Her motivation is stated as a mystical pull ("drawn by something she couldn't name") rather than a specific, active desire, and her internal conflict is summarized ("skeptical of her own emptiness") rather than felt through resistance or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Mei is a coherent focalizer with clear skills and history, but her pivotal choice relies heavily on a convenient external prompt (grandmother's message) rather than purely internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Senna's motivation is clear, but her defining trait ("richly perceptive") is told via the grandmother's letter rather than demonstrated through agency prior to the climax. The final choice to transcend feels somewhat rushed, lacking a visceral on-page struggle with what she is leaving behind beyond abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    Marina functions as a "chosen one" archetype rather than a character with internal life; she faces no difficult decisions or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is a static sage figure who lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She functions as a vessel for the theme rather than a character under pressure; her mending is an act of effortless competence, offering no struggle or cost to reveal depth. The &quot;philosopher in her&quot; narration creates distance, summarizing her wisdom instead of dramatizing a human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus's internal arc from skeptic to keeper of the mystery is well-earned through the plot, and the cost of his final decision—betraying his professional ethos—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marlowe is a consistent, legible focalizer who drives the narrative, but she lacks the internal contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    Marcus functions more as a thematic vehicle than a complex protagonist; his motivation shifts instantly from hermit to archivist without internal friction. The emotional arc is simplistic, lacking the contradictory impulses or grit required to make his transformation feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira is a competent focalizer, and her internal duality (logic vs. ancestral memory) is established quickly. However, her arc is linear execution of a pre-decided plan; there is little on-page hesitation or struggle between competing values, making the sacrifice feel inevitable rather than actively chosen in the moment. The "Collectors" remain faceless forces rather than a relationship-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Kira is competent and consistently motivated, but she functions more as an executor of a plan than a character under pressure. She faces no difficult on-page choice or dilemma that tests her resolve; the "obsession" mentioned in backstory is validated immediately, leaving her arc static. The internal conflict ("wildness" vs. control) adds texture but never threatens the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motivation shifts primarily via a magical object (the lantern) rather than organic internal pressure; the protagonist accepts the supernatural download instantly without the character-specific resistance expected from an empirical investigator.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Character motivations are clear and the interaction is grounded in a shared history. Eliza's transition from resistance to acceptance is swift but earned through the specific prop (the journal), though Marcus functions largely as a catalyst rather than a fully pressured protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pioneer reads as a determined archetype rather than a conflicted consciousness; her "yearning algorithm" acts as a plot device rather than a source of difficult internal choices.

    Lila is active and her motivation is clear, but her final choice to "upload" herself feels unearned; the narrative skips the emotional weight and human hesitation of ending one's physical existence, rendering the climax mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s internal shift from enforcer to gardener is tracked clearly, but the dialogue renders her an archetypal mouthpiece for the theme rather than a living person. The interaction lacks friction; she and the keeper agree too readily, reducing the opportunity for character dynamics to reveal depth through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marlene’s internal landscape is compelling, grounding the "euthanasia tourist" backstory in a distinct, sensory-rich worldview. However, a slight logic gap exists between her diagnosed "loose grip on reality" and her high competence in managing radio reports and evacuations; the condition feels more poetic than debilitating in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    Marcus creates a stable emotional anchor, but the daughter functions as a plot device to deliver exposition ("I found your letters") rather than a distinct character. The emotional progression is linear and lacks present-tense resistance; Marcus accepts the intrusion and the life-altering offer without the friction or internal contradiction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist functions as a compliant vessel for the plot rather than a character with agency or internal conflict. She understands the riddle "immediately" and faces no resistance from her peers or herself, stripping the narrative of decision-making pressure. The revelation of scars at the end feels symbolic rather than like a paid cost earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characterization relies heavily on labels ("subtle puzzle archivist," "perceptively calm") rather than dramatized traits. Elara faces no internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she functions solely as a plot device to execute the exhibition without struggle or distinct personality.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elena's interiority is rich and thematic ("grief-tender"), fitting the reticent scholar archetype well. However, her emotional arc is largely static; she begins and ends with the same certainty, and the "struggle" is recalled in backstory rather than dramatized through difficult choices in the present scene. The "weathered innocence" trait appears as a descriptor rather than a behavior driven by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ezra is a distinct focalizer with a compelling internal state ("bewildered witness"), but his primary epiphany ("forgetting was not a curse but a kindness") is delivered via abstract interior summary rather than dramatized pressure. The acceptance of his condition feels slightly unearned by the immediate scene, as there is little resistance or contradictory impulse shown before the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ezra is a competent protagonist with clear agency; her choice to restructure rather than flee drives the resolution. However, her interiority relies heavily on labeled emotion ("The luminous ache... wasn't fear but recognition") rather than embodied reaction. The epiphany at the end ("She'd found her purpose") is summarized rather than dramatized through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.6)
    Maya appears idealized, accepting her terminal diagnosis with a serenity that removes necessary internal conflict or grit. The attribute "decisively kind" functions as a static label rather than a trait tested by pressure, resulting in a character who feels more saintly than human.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lyra is a competent, proactive protagonist whose specific skillset drives the resolution. However, her internal conflict is minimal; the transition from curiosity to dutiful guardian is smooth and instantaneous upon realization, lacking a moment of agonizing trade-off or temptation that would deepen the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    Thomas's internal state—specifically the "cleft in certainty"—is drawn with nuance, grounding his acceptance of Elara. However, the interaction lacks present-tense friction; the sibling dynamic is affectionate but static, with Elara serving more as a thematic mirror than an active pressure on Thomas's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    Marina is a functional protagonist with a clear motivation, but her success comes too easily. She lacks a defined internal conflict or a moment of difficult choice; the solution relies on competence and magic rather than a costly sacrifice or character transformation. The "breaching whales" simile for memory is a stock phrasing artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kira's interiority is consistent, but Marcus functions primarily as a prop for her wisdom rather than an agent of genuine pressure. The dialogue leans heavily into "scripted therapy-speak" ("Marks can become the richest soil"), which flattens the emotional realism and makes the characters feel like thematic mouthpieces.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.7)
    Marina functions more as a thematic vessel than a living protagonist; her struggle is summarized ("For months, Marina had wrestled") rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The "old woman" acts as a prop rather than a character who exerts pressure, leaving Marina to react only to her own thoughts. Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("lucidly watchful," "unspoken narratives") rather than embodied emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.4)
    Elara functions as a benevolent plot device rather than a conflicted protagonist; her transition from tinkerer to singer lacks internal resistance or doubt. The emotional stakes are asserted ("voice cracked") rather than embodied through a difficult choice or sacrifice. The resolution requires no trade-off, as she succeeds instantly without risking her identity or standing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    The protagonist is professionally competent but lacks internal contradiction or a personal stake beyond the task itself. She functions more as a refined instrument of the ritual than a fully realized character with distinct, conflicting desires.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara is a competent, focused protagonist whose expertise grounds the fantastical elements. Her interiority is consistent, though the stakes feel somewhat academic; the cost of her decision to document rather than repair is intellectual rather than visceral, lacking deep emotional contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and the pivot regarding her father’s view of light effectively anchors the Conceptual Repricing of her trap. The realization that she collects burdens creates a distinct, tragic agency that fits the accumulative mode well.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.7)
    Margaret's internal state is detailed, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic summary ("Margaret understood now") rather than purely embodied reaction. The "hauntingly practical" trait feels slightly labeled, though her competent actions with the tools support the characterization well.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kira’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, grounding the fantastical setting in a recognizable human struggle between ambition and acceptance. The interaction with the ghost effectively dramatizes her internal conflict, converting introspection into an on-page dynamic. Her shift from architect to "archaeologist of voices" feels earned by the specific details of her scavenging life.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.7)
    Maya acts as a vehicle for the theme rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal contradiction or distinct, non-abstract desires. Her motivation is purely thematic ("equations for hope") rather than grounded in a character-specific need or loss that would generate on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's internal landscape is distinct and consistent, effectively contrasting her scribe persona with her musical past. The emotional arc is clear, though the epiphany arrives with relatively low resistance, relying on a convenient memory rather than present-tense pressure to force the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara’s motivation is legible, but the pivot to her father’s sweatshops relies on a sudden block of backstory rather than pressure inherent in the scene. The emotional resolution feels diagnostic—labeling the feeling as "serene upheaval" rather than embodying the struggle of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    Mara functions as a competent vehicle for the premise rather than a distinct character with internal friction; she faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Her motivation is stated rather than tested, and her "infinite patience" renders her static, removing the possibility of struggle or error.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara observes with distinct interiority, but her role remains largely passive; her motivation is stated ("learning the geography") rather than dramatized through high-pressure choices or resistance. The character functions more as a camera than an agent of change, limiting the depth of the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.3)
    Aldric reads as a genre archetype; the transition from "madman" fever to instant acceptance of the bird's flaw lacks dramatized internal resistance or struggle. The detail about synthesizing nutrients from his own tears strains credibility for a character ostensibly grounded in mathematics and science, tilting into unearned melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Maya is a coherent focalizer, but she functions more as a vessel for thematic reflection than an active agent making difficult choices in the present. Her internal landscape is rich but static; the conflict is historical rather than immediate, leading to a character arc that feels remembered rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is defined by the label "luminous skeptic," yet his actions—carrying a magical box to complete a cosmic ritual—contradict this trait entirely without internal conflict. His transformation at the end ("skepticism transformed into... wonder") is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a difficult choice or realization on the page. He functions as a courier for the plot rather than a character with agency or distinct interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    The protagonist functions as a passive observer of a cosmic cycle rather than an active agent making hard choices. Her internal conflict ("troubling serenity") is summarized rather than dramatized through action or difficult trade-offs. She performs her role perfectly without risk of failure, resulting in a character who serves as a thematic vessel rather than a living entity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Martha’s motivation to honor the collective grief is well-dramatized through her labor, and her interiority feels grounded in the craft. The grandfather functions more as a convenient dispensary of wisdom than a fully realized character, bordering on the "magical mentor" trope. His dialogue is often didactic, which flattens the emotional complexity of their relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The protagonist's internal conflict is clear, but the resolution relies on diagnostic interiority ("Theodore understood that precision was ethics...") rather than embodied change. The character's epiphany is delivered via summary explanation rather than dramatic action, flattening the emotional arc into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marta’s interiority effectively links her past (quilts) to her present stewardship, creating a consistent character logic. However, her competence is so high that the central discovery faces no internal resistance or doubt, reducing the emotional stakes of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    Mira operates as a hyper-competent archetype rather than a nuanced character; she predicts and manipulates the outcome without doubt, struggle, or internal conflict. Her success is a foregone conclusion, and her "flaws" are nonexistent, preventing any emotional engagement or character growth under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mariel is a competent vessel for the plot with no internal friction or contradictory impulses; her lack of fear and the diagnostic labeling of her emotion ("thistled calm") flatten the character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marlene is a capable focalizer with clear motivation, yet she functions more as a thematic archetype than a deeply conflicted individual in this specific moment. Her interiority often summarizes the story's philosophy ("Marlene understood this better than anyone") rather than embodying the raw, immediate cost of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus creates a strong focal point with consistent motivation (truth-seeking). The shift from antagonist to collaborator is earned through the shared appreciation of the artifact, though the dialogue occasionally forces characters to articulate their traits ("abrasive calm") rather than demonstrating them purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maestro Chen is drawn with warmth, but her internal landscape relies heavily on summarized backstory ("unlearning hatred") rather than active struggle in the scene. Her emotional arc is linear and sentimental; she moves from resignation to fulfillment without confronting a genuine on-page contradiction or making a difficult trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira is a static vehicle for the "wise rebel" archetype, lacking internal contradiction or doubt to complicate her choices. The attribute "informally wise" is asserted via label rather than demonstrated through complex interaction or decision-making under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mira is distinct, and the honesty compulsion provides a clear constraint. However, the crowd's immediate, consequence-free acceptance of her theft undermines the risk she takes, making her choice feel weightless. The shift from secrecy to revelation relies on a riddle-prompted epiphany rather than compounding internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    Marina is a distinct observer, but her agency is limited; the central epiphany is delivered by the magical object rather than internal struggle, making the final sacrifice feel somewhat calculated rather than emotionally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The protagonist's acceptance of the genocide/sacrifice nuance is too rapid and emotionally tidy ("History isn't black and white—it's purple"), reading as authorial thematic summary rather than a character's earned realization under pressure. Marina's voice dissolves into diagnostic "theme-speak" at the climax, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Characterization is tightly integrated with the story's high-concept premise; Marcus's "grim optimism" isn't just a label but the engine of the narrative. The specific interplay between his mathematical worldview and his embodied grief ("calculating the distance" to Sarah's desk) creates a distinct, cohesive interiority. His persistence is earned through the "measured recklessness" of the die rolls, grounding his struggle in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist is largely passive; the central action (painting) happens to her via a magical object ("hand moved without conscious thought") rather than through agency or skill. Interiority relies on label-speak ("creative drought," "methodically hopeful") rather than embodied contradiction. There is no internal conflict; the character simply moves from blocked to inspired to celebrated without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Marta is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation. However, the emotional climax—the shift from dread to "fierce tenderness"—is summarized in the final paragraph rather than dramatized through a distinct interaction, reading more as an authorial conclusion than a character's lived shift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara is a distinct, competent focalizer whose backstory informs her present skill set well. However, she functions largely as a high-competence problem solver without significant internal flaws or in-scene doubts to complicate the narrative. Her emotional arc is a realization rather than a transformation born of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mara’s motivation is visceral and clear, anchored by the backstory of her "first death." Cornelius provides a distinct, coherent counter-voice ("silk pulled through broken glass"). However, the emotional climax relies on a rapid therapeutic realization ("fear of fear is just another mirror") that feels slightly abstract and rushed rather than fully earned through dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kessa is defined by high competence and role rather than internal conflict or dilemma. Her struggle is purely physical ("muscles aching") rather than a choice between competing values or a psychological hurdle. While functional, the lack of a difficult trade-off or flaw limits the emotional depth of her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira is a competent, active protagonist whose professional skills (cartography, pattern recognition) drive the plot. Her motivation is consistent, though the key trait ("quietly driven") is established through narrative summary and direct labeling ("driven by something stronger than fear") rather than purely through dramatic friction early on.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Elara's motivation is clear, but her primary trait ("emotional rationality") relies on diagnostic labeling rather than dramatized, embodied action under pressure. Marcus's conversion from antagonist to ally feels rushed; his decision to abandon his Ministry role lacks sufficient on-page struggle or established internal conflict to earn the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motivation is clear, but the use of the diagnostic label "stoically sensitive" to define the protagonist's state flattens the interiority. The emotional pivot relies on this explicit summarization rather than a purely dramatized, embodied reaction to the surroundings.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Character motivation is tightly bound to the setting and constraints; Mira's internal drive ("find profound purpose in the quiet spaces") perfectly justifies her risk-taking. The choice to stay until the last safe moment demonstrates a hierarchy of values where truth outweighs safety, creating a strong, earned emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.5)
    Motivation is clear, but the emotional arc relies on summary and stated epiphanies ("Mei understood then") rather than embodied struggle. The protagonist's internal state is often described with labels like "luminous torment" rather than dramatized through specific, conflicted reactions in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Amira is a competent, proactive protagonist whose agency drives the plot from the planned intrusion to the final release. Her motivation is deeply rooted in backstory, though her emotional experience is occasionally summarized ("grief," "hope") rather than fully embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    Kira functions primarily as a camera operator for the plot rather than a character with distinct agency or struggle. Her interaction with the pilgrim is passive acceptance of exposition, and her "perpetual surprise" is a stated label rather than a flaw that complicates choices. The resolution brings an epiphany without an emotional price or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Character conception is excellent; Elias's profession as a forger of histories creates deep, organic irony when confronted with his grandfather's hidden truth. The internal conflict is vivid, and the decision to dismantle his life's work feels earned by the specific weight of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elara’s motivation is clearly drawn from personal and generational history, creating a coherent emotional arc. Her choice to accept the apology is earned, though the "uncommonly thoughtful" descriptor feels slightly performative rather than internalized. The characterization is strong, but the wisdom dispensed comes a bit too easily, lacking the grit of active struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marcus creates a clear focal point, but his emotional arc relies on convenience rather than pressure. The shift from "broken" to "ready to teach" pivots on a cliché encounter with a seal, feeling unearned by the preceding struggle. The "laughter" beat resolves the internal tension too easily, bypassing the necessary resistance to change.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    Marcus is a passive protagonist who follows instructions and accepts a lecture without generating friction or distinct tactics. His internal state is labeled ("guilt without memory") rather than demonstrated through conflicting desires or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s motivation is visceral, rooted deeply in grief and a specific history with Kess. The internal conflict—craving connection while fearing the dissolution of self—is dramatized well through the ritual. The transformation feels earned by her willingness to spend "everything," resulting in a distinct new state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s motivation to reconcile joy and grief is compelling and anchors the narrative well. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly smooth; the shift from deep guilt to restoration occurs via ritual success rather than a moment of agonizing, character-defining choice or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mei functions as a competent archetype ("bodhisattva") rather than a conflicted individual. Her actions proceed from training rather than difficult on-page choices; she faces the shadow dimension without stumbling or doubt, resulting in a static character arc where competence solves the problem without internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's motivation is consistent, but her agency is diluted by the premise that "reality rearranged itself" to suit her, removing the friction of genuine struggle. Interiority relies heavily on summary ("calculated generosity," "pure intention") rather than dramatized, conflicted choices within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thorne is a capable, consistent protagonist, but the lack of internal conflict or hesitation renders him somewhat static. Amara's arrival dissipates tension rather than complicating it, as her allegiance is established immediately without on-page negotiation. The shared risk is stated ("You risk much") rather than dramatized through a difficult choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Yann’s internal landscape is compelling, balancing the burden of her "curse" with her duty. The shift from herder to guardian is earned through the revelation, offering a clear emotional reconfiguration. The specific mechanics of her precognition (seeing three heartbeats ahead) add distinct texture to her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s motivation is distinctly rendered, blending artistic necessity with political resistance. Interiority is rich and specific to her role as a poet-astronomer. The prompt-mandated attribute "furiously tranquil" is told rather than purely embodied, but her steady work amidst the storm effectively dramatizes her stoicism.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Characters function as archetypes delivering thematic lectures rather than people under pressure. Interiority is limited to backstory summary; the protagonist faces no internal conflict or difficult choice, merely executing a pre-planned interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The protagonist is defined almost entirely by backstory and philosophical exposition rather than present-moment struggle. While her motivation is stated clearly ("forge beauty from anarchy"), she faces no active decision or contradiction in the scene, performing a rote task without embodied cost or internal conflict. She reads more as a vehicle for the concept than a living character navigating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marion’s yearning is palpable and her dedication to the ritual is clear, but her internal arc lacks contradiction or resistance. The "strategically creative" trait is demonstrated well through the film splicing, but the emotional victory feels inevitable rather than wrestled from doubt, resulting in a somewhat linear psychological progression.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira is a functional protagonist whose agency drives the resolution via the ledger and seed. While her intellectual epiphany is earned and shapes the outcome, her emotional stakes ("heavier than grief") are stated more than embodied, keeping the internal conflict slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kenji’s internal landscape of grief is well-rendered, and the motivation to reconcile is clear. However, his agency is diluted because the pivotal insights come from reading explicit instructions on the lace rather than earned internal struggle or interaction. The student functions more as a prop than a distinct character or source of genuine pressure.

    Silas's insomnia curse roots motivation in embodied details like trembling hands and aching teeth; interiority particular via undertaker lens on books as bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marta's interiority shines in embodied actions like weathered hands pausing on the bell rope; dialogue with Samuel reveals character-specific values without epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mae's motivation rooted in vivid past-life memory compels micro-choices like tear application and photo release; embodied emotions (copper taste, breathing shifts) show contradiction between seeking and giving.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara's motivation to grasp time's texture roots in consistent designer traits, intensifying via fragment visions; embodied emotions (trembling fingers, warming palm) contradict entrapment impulses.

    Cassia's expertise and motivation as light archaeologist compel her precise actions under time pressure, with embodied precision in jar use; mother's arrival forces relational micro-choice revealing daughter's longing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina's motivation to craft spheres from father's memory drives consistent micro-choices like placing the bookmark and handing a sphere to the couple, earning a small relational shift; interiority embodied in sweeping and blowing glass avoids labels. Minor flaw: narration occasionally abstracts contradiction into tidy wisdom rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus's phobias transform into weapons via embodied realization ("Every moment of manufactured fear had taught him"), earning the reversal choice with contradictory fear/certainty impulses acting in the confrontation; Jake applies immediate pressure as creator/handler.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong particular interiority and embodied endurance in closing the booklet and descending with stiff joints, earning final stasis; obsession shown via 7-year vigil constrains choices effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority particular through janitor precision aiding temporal disorientation; micro-choices like abandoning mop reveal values under curiosity pressure. Final endurance of routine post-realization feels earned with cost in endless cycles.

Interiority concrete and particular, like tracing sweating bricks amid radio static. Final renunciation earned by prior radio-deepened motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong consistent motivation rooted in deliberate forgetting, embodied in handling the swan and silence toward explorers; interiority concrete via patterns and root-paths.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Characterization excels in embodied emotion and micro-choices like flute-playing tied to lullabies, rooting Elena's nurturing in concrete traits; Sofia applies relational pressure effectively.

    Marcus's guilt-without-memory paradox drives contradictory impulses peaking in his voiced doubt ("Why should they forgive someone who gets to forget?"), earning the final step with embodied cost in scars and temple tenderness. Old woman's traits consistent but secondary. Minor tell in procedure backstory doesn't flatten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira's motivation to reforge the bond drives concrete micro-choices like uncorking the vial under Silverwhisper's pressure, with contradictory impulses embodied in trembling hands and firm voice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional interiority and embodied contradiction in "beauty of it pressed against her throat, choking her," driving earned restoration; guilt endures as visible cost in final choice. Contradictory impulses act on-page via card-laying despite persistent flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s interiority—her calm defection from academia—feels lived-in, but the pivot from neutron-star detachment to dust mystic is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene. The final resignation carries cost, yet the emotional price is summarized (“career suicide”) rather than embodied in a visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers from recognition, not cold—and her micro-choices (folding the strip to her heart, walking deeper) embody earned renunciation with visible cost. The “steadily adaptive” trait is shown via frost-to-glass epiphany rather than label. No contradictory impulses in scene, but the causality of her decision to abandon identity is more asserted than dramatized in a single beat, keeping her just shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—frozen tears, tactile vibration, the tuning fork pressed to glass. The contradiction between her grief for sound and her fierce need to “rectify” the loss drives every micro-choice; her silent transcription of thermal “notes” is embodied, not abstract. No epiphany is declared—she earns the insight by sleepless, data-heavy labor. The final, frozen tear crystallizes her cost without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Silas’s insomnia-born vocation and quiet mortuary competence are lived-in from line 1; every beat (hand tremor, grief-bubble dive, salt-water embalming of books) grows from the same weary spine. The final renunciation—staying below to bury civilizations so he can finally sleep—pays off every prior micro-choice and carries a felt cost: he forfeits the surface world. Interiority stays concrete (“grief-bubble diving bell” vs. therapy speak) and contradiction is constant (fear vs. compulsion). No label-only emotion; embodiment and flaw drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marta’s interiority (“need has no face, and neither should kindness”) is concrete and character-specific; her renunciation of credit is earned through six months of micro-choices. The only flaw is mild label-speak (“she understood human nature with a gently persistent wisdom”) that abstracts rather than embodies. Still, her endurance carries visible cost—she is “tired now, her work complete”—and the community’s anonymity preserves her hierarchy of values. Relationship crucible is off-stage, but Samuel’s silent partnership shows status shift without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mae’s longing is embodied (taste of copper heartbreak, shallow-held breaths) and her micro-choice to uncork the vial is credibly costly—she empties her archive of solitude. Yet the ghost-woman’s sudden appearance and instruction feel externally imposed, softening the sense that Mae’s contradictory impulses drive the final surrender. Interiority stays concrete, but the epiphany (“she understood then why she’d been chosen”) edges close to meta-diagnosis at the very beat that should feel self-discovered. Still, the renunciation lands with visible loss and her breathing pattern remains a consistent, character-specific flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory—her trembling fingers, whispered recognition, and final laugh all reveal a mind caught between terror and rapture. The halo fragment acts as a concrete external cue that forces micro-choices (grip, step, release) and anchors her shifting stance toward time. Her motivation to “feel time’s texture” remains singular and intensifies; each garden she walks through is a live test of that desire. The earned stasis is credible: she relinquishes the fragment and every fixed self, paying the cost of perpetual irresolution—glimpsing infinite selves yet owning none.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is lean but embodied: the chain-song, the token filing, the seed scattering all manifest patience without naming it. His estrangement from carnival fame and his quiet cultivation of maps inside a piano feel idiosyncratic and credible. The moment he pockets heritage wheat crystallizes a hierarchy of values (freedom < eco-insurgency) with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene, only implied, so the final renunciation is just shy of 9-band earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—genius inventor still deaf to the one frequency she needs—drives every beat. Her embodied synesthesia (“heard it as rainfall on leaves”) and the micro-choice to fire the corroded forge anchor idiosyncratic agency. The final renunciation—accepting the double-edged sound of trust—pays off the grandfather’s cellular-tumor memory with visible cost. Only slack: the “cells divide” refrain is told, never felt in her body under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cassia’s quietly-savvy ethos is embodied in tactile micro-moves (uncapping jar, tracing tension on glass) that align with her “archaeologist of light” motive; contradiction between beauty-theft and truth-service remains implicit but legible. Mother’s grief supplies external pressure; Cassia’s renunciation of further explanation shows earned stasis at cost of ongoing emotional load. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak; one beat of diagnostic phrasing (“already leaving…”) is forgiven for immediacy. No knowledge leak; competence balanced with fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—her need to stay vs. her need to leave the capital—are dramatized through the micro-choice of returning to the plant; embodied emotion (“her breath visible,” “voice echoing”) grounds her grief without label-speak. The final act of handing a warm sphere to strangers crystallizes her renunciation of solitary artistry for communal healing, the cost legible in the torch’s dying blue. No second character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is waived; the interior arc alone drives the closure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s fear-programming and methodical stunt-double persona are sharply drawn, but the pivot from “I’m not human” to instant mastery of reversal-code feels rushed; a micro-beat of fumbling doubt would have sealed motivation. Interiority is mostly embodied, yet the climactic line “You gave me the perfect defense” drifts into label-speak. Interior contradiction is present (terror vs. drive to know), powering the beat where he steels his trembling hand. The earned cost—claiming the shell and walking away—lands, though deeper scar tissue on identity could have stung more.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is atmospheric but abstract—feelings are named (“ambered hush,” “mildly obsessed”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses act in-scene; the oracle only watches and whispers. The final smile is a micro-choice, yet its cost is conceptual, not felt. Enough for credible endurance, but not for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Seven’s “remarkably composed” janitor programming becomes a credible character trait that both enables and limits his access to awe; the amalgamation of timelines is shown as a calm, custodial act of “cleaning perception,” a lovely interior contradiction. Motivation stays anchored to the concrete quest for origin, never drifts into abstract self-help speak. The final beat—returning to mop while carrying multitudes—earns an Earned Stasis with visible cost: he forecloses human-style transcendence for eternal maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt, protectiveness, residual tenderness—are alive in the same breath; her decision to muddy the audit data is a visible micro-choice that costs her professional integrity and alliance with Samuel. Samuel’s self-sacrifice for Marcus is credibly motivated and lands with felt social cost (job jeopardy, public suspicion). The hand-hold at the end is earned because both have paid: she has risked her record, he his reputation. Interiority stays concrete (“the weight of withheld truth had crystallized”) and avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marta’s contradictory impulses—tending a “dismal 2.1” garden while hoarding cracked marbles—are dramatized in scene, not summarised. Her micro-choice to press a fresh, sharp marble into the girl’s palm crystallises her hierarchy of values: propagate deceitful hope over measurable truth. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic; the “bloom-rot” smile is an embodied, idiosyncratic image. Cost is visible: every new crack in the marble collection is a scar she both cherishes and cannot stop accumulating.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ira Chen’s obsession with “time moving sideways” is declared more than dramatized; the lever choice is the only micro-choice on the page, and the cost is asserted (“the universe would never look the same”) rather than embodied. Interiority is evocative but loops: “icy warmth,” “mechanically warm,” “amber glow” become repeated mood labels. No contradiction or blind spot is tested; she succeeds without setback, so the arc is static. The xenobiology creatures supply awe but no pressure; Ira’s relationships are off-stage, so no crucible exists.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s solitary obsession is credibly rooted in grief and vocation; his micro-choice to wade chest-deep and hold the impossible note shows a hierarchy of values. Interiority is concrete—“hummed the melody silently, his throat moving without sound”—and avoids label-speak. The endurance cost (wet clothes vs. dry program at close) is felt, though the change is more mystical than psychological; still, the renunciation of safety satisfies Earned Stasis under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “gift as a fault-tolerant oracle” is shown through embodied sensation, not label-speak. The contradictory impulse to stay vs. descend is held in scene, and her final choice to smudge her own signature crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth vs. exposure) with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; her micro-choices (sleeping in closet, drawing in pencil) reveal motive under pressure. Earned renunciation feels inevitable yet wounding.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus’s Methodist-scientific skepticism is sketched early and steers his decision to photograph, not touch, the valve; the interior divide between curiosity and credulity is felt in micro-gestures (hand pausing, radio tuning). Yet the “weight of swallowed truth” is asserted more than embodied—no bodily cost or lasting handicap is dramatized—so the renunciation feels light. Secondary voices (callers) supply pressure but not relationship crucible; their guilt is atmospheric rather than interactive. Interior contradiction is present but not sharpened to a wound that lingers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.6)
    Interiority is lyrically textured but homogenously calm; no contradictory impulse ever destabilises her. The eternal stance is declared, not dramatised; micro-choices are missing. Cost (“pure witness”) is asserted, not paid on-page. All emotional beats occupy the same meditative register, flattening progression.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elena’s contradictory impulse—clutching then surrendering the curl—plays out in real time; the embodied memory of rocking Sofia at dawn roots every beat. The moment of release is earned by thirty-one years of faithful tending, and the cost (irretrievable loss of the token) is felt on the page. Sofia’s secondary pressure is present but light; their status shift from caretaker to fellow-singer is legible in the final hand-squeeze. Interiority avoids label-speak, using sensory memory instead of diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thrain’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “gift” opening fully in the spiral stairwell is a micro-choice that costs her equilibrium and locks her into custodianship. The contradiction between solitude and the need to keep every echo alive is felt, not stated. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A; single-POV arc earns credible Earned Stasis with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Chen’s contradictory impulses—architect of futures vs. subject of his own prophecy—surface late but are embodied in the microdot gesture and final self-fortune. Interiority is specific (“composer becomes his own music”), not label-speak, and the renunciation costs him presence on the island. Micro-choices (arranging slips, stepping into lighthouse) align with motive, though earlier beats lean on atmospheric observation. Earned stasis achieved, but cost could be sharper on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marcus’s calm, ritualized patience is consistent and specific, but the possessed woman remains a near-blank vessel; we glimpse no contradictory impulse in either of them, so the “interior contradiction” test is only half-met. His final insight is earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mei’s interiority is rich, embodied, and consistent—her “chronological homesickness” is felt in breath on glass, shell against palm, and the spiral of fortunes. The flaw of temporal dislocation drives every micro-choice; the final endurance of conducting is earned. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived. Could edge 9.0 if one more concrete sacrifice were visible before the crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kira’s interior contradiction—yearning for wholeness while refusing to collapse any timeline—remains vivid and embodied; the floating body and tablet’s weight externalize the split. Micro-choices (pressing the “collapse / unite” rune, finally touching stone) trace a believable arc from diffusion to integration. The elderly Kira apparition supplies externalized pressure, but because she is still Kira, the scene never becomes a true relational crucible; the stakes stay solipsistic. Cost is felt: the dusting tablet and solid footfall are tangible prices, yet the merging of selves is narrated more than dramatized, muting the ache that would push this to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is rich, embodied, and character-specific—Lucia’s perception of “music written in marrow” and her bone-level listening feels singular. Contradictory impulses (longing for sound vs. fear of renewed numbness) coil inside every beat. The broken needle as talisman and the choice to keep it polished smooth dramatize a credible, costly renunciation: she accepts deafness yet re-opens feeling. No stock therapy-speak; even the epiphany is delivered as tactile image (needle catching final light) rather than label.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete—her methodical handling of the pigeon, the anemometer, the journal—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values (truth > safety). The final decision to cache duplicate records is earned by the prior stalking beat and the second note; cost is felt in the phrase “waiting for the storm that would set it free.” No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hand, tears that refract light, the way scent hijacks breath—but the “living archive” epiphany is stated more than dramatized. The contradiction between aromatic caution and inhaling the vial is present yet smoothed by authorial exposition rather than a visible micro-choice with cost. The mother’s absence is felt, but the filial relationship pressure is off-stage; the greenhouse ghosts do not talk back, so the crucible is internal and solipsistic. The ending renunciation (re-corking, accepting tears as translation) is earned, but the causal path is slightly shortcut by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s poet-observer identity is vivid and consistent—his interiority filters every beat through texture and metaphor. The rope triggers embodied, character-specific reactions that reveal his hunger for layered truth. Yet his passivity in the final third—he simply watches layers unroll—keeps the change observational rather than costly; the Earned Stasis feels intellectual, not viscerally paid for. Interior contradiction is present but muted; we’re told he “laughs, soft and wondering” without bodily rupture to match the cosmic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—gifted acoustic perception yet forced into silence—drives every micro-choice; the decision to play anyway crystallizes her values. Embodied cost is visible when “her violin singing with the magnificent simplicity of survival” links physical endurance to artistic duty. No stock label-speak; emotions surface through ash-dusted doors and warped flute reeds. The final earned stasis—accepting incompletion—grows logically from grandmother’s seed and her own damaged instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s contradictory drives—craving genuine feeling vs. never consuming her wares—are embodied in the static-charged amber touches and the micro-choice to press the petal to her own chest. Her “affectionate detachment” surfaces in every beat, from murmuring “There you are” to the widower’s laugh she’ll sell tomorrow. The rule “never consume the merchandise” costs her the moment of absorption she aches for, so the renunciation is earned and priced. Minor slip: “professionally thorough” is asserted more than dramatized in this single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Margot’s interiority is serviceable—her nightly ledger ritual and the “something she couldn’t name” give a credible itch—but the pivot from detached broker to library missionary is asserted more than embodied. The single micro-choice (convincing Captain Torres) is thin; we’re told she’s “shrewd” yet never see her bargaining. Emotion stays at a polite remove, never contradictory under pressure. Competent, but not yet a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—her “boldly sympathetic certainty” shows up in micro-gestures like extending the reed circle to the exiled artist—but the final reconciliation beat is off-stage summary (“They climbed back together…”) so the cost of her compassion is asserted, not embodied. The ancient artist’s decades of isolation are likewise compressed into a single tear, blunting the emotional crucible needed for a 7+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—illustrating life while complicit in time-theft—drives every beat; her decision to finish the drawings rather than preserve them crystallizes an earned renunciation with visible cost (cracked pendant, cleared canals). Emotion stays embodied in throat-hum, pencil tremor, sprinting leap; no diagnostic self-talk. The inherited duty motivates without over-exposition; the final shift to drawing living creatures proves the arc. Secondary characters absent, so no relationship crucible—acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Morrow’s gently-inventive meticulousness is embodied in months of phosphorescent mapping; her interior contradiction—yearning for Elias yet accepting his transformation—drives the climax choice to leave the eyes. The renunciation costs her the tactile mentor she sought, paid in the final image of “absence… another form of presence.”

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Edgar’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet hiding—are embodied in his gift-giving from the crawl space, giving visible cost to his solitude. The renunciation of full visibility at the end is fore-grounded by the quiet, methodical cache system, so the Earned Stasis feels earned. One hairline slip: “he understood that particular hunger” edges toward diagnostic label-speak without immediate embodied counter-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his fingernails greening, veins rooting—yet his contradictory impulse (scientist’s control vs. participation) remains stated rather than dramatized in a single visible beat. The final surrender is earned, but the cost is more announced (“no longer fully human”) than felt through embodied contradiction. Still, the perceptual signature is strong and flaws stay clear of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s exhaustion, paint-stained fingers, and the brooch she “still gripped” show embodied contradiction between duty to the dead and need for pre-war purity. Her micro-choice to taste the water crystallizes her hierarchy of art over comfort. The interiority—“world cracked open and bled its oceans dry”—is character-specific and avoids label-speak. Insomnia is not merely stated: it warps her gait on barnacled stones and sharpens the final resolve to “paint until the water was gone,” making the renunciation earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.6)
    Vera’s blindness to her own future is lived in the body (her teeth ache from the pearl’s buzz) and drives every step; the renunciation of grand prophecy for present enchantment is earned through concrete micro-choices under escalating pressure. The interior contradiction—clinging to sight while learning to inhabit blindness—plays out in real time as she grips then dissolves the pearl. The pilgrim’s minimal presence still triggers a visible status shift at the mouth of the cave, sealing the cost. Voice stays individual, never drifts into therapeutic gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kessa’s vocation and exile-backstory give her a sharp, specific lens; her micro-choices (turning the valve, re-ordering fragments) embody the need to “read absence.” Interiority stays concrete, but the piece leans on summary rather than in-scene contradiction under pressure, so the final “mechanical sigh” feels earned yet not viscerally costly. Secondary characters are off-page or functional, so relationship crucible is N/A. No motivational breaks, but depth plateaus just below high-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete (cold stone wall, tile warmth) and contradictory impulses surface—skepticism vs. willingness to keep the “magic” tile—yet the climactic shift into acceptance is declared ("she understood") rather than dramatized through a visible cost, softening the arc. Still, her embodied reactions and micro-choice to climb the platform with the tile earn partial credit.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vex’s twelve-millennium fatigue is shown through her indifferent handling of the storm and the amulet; the interior contradiction—yearning for death yet hesitating—peaks when she fuses the fragments and smiles for the first time in centuries. The micro-choice to thread magnetic bridges for Thorne’s crew crystallizes her shift from passive observer to active conspirator. One hairline slip: “immortality’s weight” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Maya’s interiority—honest, methodical, mortician-trained—remains concrete and particular; her simultaneous care for her father’s corpse and for the moral ledger gives her a credible, contradictory impulse under pressure. The micro-choice to cremate a pinch of ash into the ink pot crystallizes her values and forecloses easy forgiveness. Wei’s confusion-to-acceptance is sketched too swiftly, denying the scene full crucible status, so the relationship shift feels declared rather than earned. Still, Maya’s professional composure versus inherited guilt supplies enough visible cost to satisfy the 9− quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stationer’s quiet, meticulous ritual is vividly embodied; her aching fingers and reverent handling of lamp and notepad make the obsession tactile. Yet the interior contradiction—belief versus official denial—stays summary; we never feel her doubt or risk. The monk’s wordless tea offers a micro-choice of acceptance, but the cost of her “invented histories” remains conceptual rather than personal. Still, the specificity of her craft and the bodily toll earn a strong mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mari’s contradictory impulse—clinging to erasure while hungering for witness—surfaces in every micro-choice: letting the false death stand, penciling “light enough to be mistaken for shadows,” signing a hybrid name. The final renunciation (joining the erased congregation) costs her the last scrap of legal self and is fully earned. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the absence of on-page opposition keeps this shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—humming as a lie-detector tic, the seashell against her ear—and her shift from debunker to co-creator is legible. Claudia’s entrance supplies external pressure, yet her own motives remain a touch schematic; the father-daughter grief is told more than dramatized. Overall, credible emotional stakes and a visible renunciation (joining the unfinished instrument) earn the arc, but the slight over-reliance on Claudia’s exposition keeps the change shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the stone chip, the “painful clarity” of her straddling two worlds—but the turn where she suddenly “announces” the plan feels outline-like; we leap from decoding graffiti to leading a town-hall without seeing her agonize aloud or stumble. The grandmother’s stone gives her a tactile, inherited stake, yet the grandmother herself is off-stage, so the generational grief never lands as a live contradiction inside Maya. The final beat—her thumb pressed to the stone while watching boats approach—shows embodied cost, but the moment is brief and solitary, so the relational price stays thin. Still, her orderly mind is credibly used: she translates walls, forges permits, weaponizes her mainland education; the competence/flaw balance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s solitary vigil is credibly driven by a stubborn, almost monastic devotion to witnessing; her micro-choices—isolating the grain, mixing the regolith emulsion, placing the hourglass—are specific and costly, culminating in an earned renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in tool-handling and bodily action rather than abstraction. The only minor drag is a touch of diagnostic self-explanation (“she understood she was photographing…”) that momentarily over-articulates what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s blindness is not a label but a lived perceptual system: the droplet acoustics, wing-beat vortices, and bench-top vibrations are embodied, contradictory, and decisive. The apprentice exists mostly as witness, yet his one question (“How do you oversee…”) triggers Maya’s clearest articulation of stakes, so status shifts are minimal but present. The final renunciation—“I just helped them find their way”—carries visible cost: she turns back to “broken things,” foreclosing any heroic credit. Competence is balanced by genuine struggle (micro-fracture search, exact membrane pressure) and no safety-hedging perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Margot’s interiority is sharp—her dry aside to the falcon, the instinctive pocketing of the phrasebook, the micro-choice to trust the inspector all read as particular to her. Yet the “subtly confident” trait is asserted more than embodied; we see competence but not the visible cost of that confidence under threat. The final alliance lands cleanly, but the emotional contradiction between obsession and risk is sketched rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bell tuner’s motives remain abstract—“restore shared balance” is stated, not dramatized—so her decisive acts feel lightly motivated. Thomas’s shift from curious boy to teacher is sketched in two lines, so the cost of carrying the tradition is asserted, not embodied. No interior contradiction or visible price is attached to anyone’s choice, keeping the arc pleasant but frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s interiority is rich and embodied—her contradictory pull between science and transcendence plays out in the vial-to-mask gesture and the final exhale. The micro-choice to inhale temple-water is earned by the accumulating memory-visions and the ticking clock. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped. Slight reserve: the “scientist” tag is asserted more than lived-in through technical diction or tools beyond the recorder.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s hovering body and inherited shame embody the impossibility he must redeem; the journals’ discovery converts filial duty into urgent testimony, a believable pivot. Interiority stays physical—“threading his way into the corridor like smoke”—rather than abstract. The final self-naming “Marcus True-Tongue” is earned by the lattice’s proof and the hovering constraint that keeps him both prisoner and witness. Cost is visible: once the lattice records truth, escape or recant is impossible—he is locked to the story he releases.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marlow’s interiority is richly embodied (“mournful elation,” “tasting salt and liberation”), but his contradictory impulses are told rather than dramatized in scene; the ancestor’s memories flood in without prior micro-choices that foreshadow this surrender, so the final release feels assisted rather than earned. Ghost-bride pressure is atmospheric, not interpersonal—she never forces a visible trade-off on him—so the relationship crucible is implied, not activated. The bead’s hum and warmth are good object-handles, yet the emotional cost of letting her go registers more on the orchard (ordinary apples) than on his body/stance, softening the earned-stasis punch.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Calla’s interior contradiction—poet-turned-weaver who clings to a drowned past while stitching an impossible future—remains vivid and embodied. The “phantom stitches” and salt-stiff fingers show emotion without label-speak. Yet her final smile arrives with no fresh micro-choice on the page; the cost of her endurance is told (“visible as petroglyphs”) rather than dramatized, blunting the Earned Stasis. Still, her flawed, obsessive lens feels individual, not templated.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Miriam’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tremble from recognition, not fatigue; the sundial’s weight feels “both foreign and familiar.” The decision to stay and rebuild is earned by the cumulative weight of dream-returns and the literal inscription her grandmother left. The only minor slack is that her “lost faith” is asserted more than dramatized in-scene; we see her curiosity warm, but the earlier spiritual rupture is summarized. Still, the renunciation of exile life is legible and costly: she kneels and begins mapping, foreclosing the option of leaving again.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—crafting counterfeit selves while craving authentic human delay—remains vivid; her micro-choice to photograph the impermanent chalk pattern embodies the cost of her art, foreclosing anonymity for herself. Motivation stays consistent and scales to the stake: giving others the gift of “a true name” while erasing her own trace. The only flaw is a slight over-articulation of her desire (“she had given them what they’d really wanted”) that borders diagnostic self-summary, nudging the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s “drooling fool” disguise is a living contradiction: every cackle masks a logarithmic memory, every pricked finger a deliberate blood-code. The cost of lifelong concealment peaks when she threads literal starlight into velvet—her final act before the coup she will not live to see. Interiority stays concrete (“humming harmonizing with the eternal flame’s ancient, patient burning”) without slipping into label-speak. Only the absence of an embodied setback under final pressure keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    The medium’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chest pulses against the stone, her hands remember séance burns. The contradictory impulse to protect-by-silence vs. need-to-speak is alive in every beat. Yet the moment of actual apology is slightly under-drafted; the shard does the speaking for her, muting the cost of her own vocal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—survivor’s guilt fused with morphine-loosened candor—grounds every micro-choice; the coral hand-off crystallizes her shift from mediator to mentor. The child’s shrewd innocence is shown, not labeled, through the cast-demanding gesture and silent acceptance of the coral. One beat of over-explained backstory (the school-hostage sentence) slightly dilates the 20 % cap, and the “lotus-hearted ache” phrase edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Interiority is lyrical and specific to Marina’s light-painting gift; contradictions (aching joy, bitter-sweet seed memory) register. Micro-choice—deciding to venture deeper tomorrow—caps an arc from isolation to communal restoration; cost is the ephemeral nature of dreams. No second character on page, so status/relationship tests N/A. The “gift awakening” and “knowledge network” flood are slightly abstract, skirting diagnostic-speak, but embodied light-work keeps it from label-only abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s contradictory impulses—methodical restorer vs. playful seeker—are dramatized in the moment she flips the coin; the embodied tremor of her brush and the laugh that “bewitched the space” show interiority without label-speak. The hobo nickel’s sleeping/waking faces literally externalize her internal seesaw, and her final choice to re-seal the coin is a credible renunciation that costs her certainty. Marcus is less a crucible than a sounding board, but the acoustic garden itself acts as secondary pressure, forcing her micro-choices into audible feedback. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness—“methodical nature warred with inexplicable playfulness”—but it is immediately grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s calm, methodical release of insects to scramble scanners crystallizes his quiet-rebel persona; Serena’s roguish charisma is conveyed through nimble dialogue and seed-handling beats. Interiority is concrete—“his beetles responded to his sudden tension”—and both retain distinct speech cadences. The final smile under raid-threat shows earned stasis: he accepts capture risk to keep the garden network alive. Flaws: no interior contradiction shown in-scene; competence feels near-perfect, softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The poet’s century-spanning insomnia is embodied through charcoal-scrawled walls and cracked lullabies; her renunciation of flower-grenades and embrace of “photosynthetic pain” supply a credible, visible cost. Interior contradiction is lyrically rendered yet causally thin—no single moment forces her to risk something she treasures. The final stance of perpetual teaching is Earned Stasis, but the absence of a tangible opposing pressure keeps motivation just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    A disciplined, embodied caretaker whose ritualized movements anchor every beat; the solitary POV means we measure her through micro-choices (breathing the name into the orchid, steadying the lamp) rather than relationship dynamics. The grandmother quest supplies clear drive, yet interiority drifts into lyrical paraphrase (“foxglove regret, beautiful and poisonous”) that tells us the emotion’s label instead of letting embodied contradiction show. Closure is earned: the refusal to surrender the name hardens into a new lens on her lifelong task, cost legible in the split bamboo’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the ink glow—but her “carefully reckless” trait is asserted more than dramatized. The moment she laughs at the impossible glow is the first embodied contradiction, late but effective. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A; mentor is off-stage exposition. The arc is credible endurance, yet the cost (sleep, career risk) is summary, not felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—engineer’s pragmatism vs. inherited matriarchal tenderness—remains concrete through tactile micro-choices (palm on stone, chain coiled, carving plans while refusing credit). The “tremble” beats crystallize her recognition that kindness must hide inside strategy; embodied cost (leaving her authorship behind) is visible. Grandmother’s dictum is the only near-slip toward label-speak, but it is dramatized within one sentence of chain-handling, forestalling deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Margot’s interiority is textured—her mapping of dust motes, the tremor in a stranger’s handwriting—yet the climactic self-recognition leans on a single tender reveal (Theodore’s envelope) rather than a visible, costly choice. The meteorite and dust patterns externalize her shift, but the emotional price is gestured at, not enacted; still, contradictory impulses (erase vs. preserve) coexist convincingly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her finger tracing the railing grain, the 7-foot row spacing matching her father’s arm-span—but the climactic “threshold” discovery leans on abstract weather-code intuition rather than a visible choice that costs her something. The emotional stakes crest in the whispered name, yet the prior beat is summary (“she intuited the final truth”), blunting the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—reading star-maps in condensation, pressing palm to glass to feel ancient song—contradictory impulses (scientist vs mystic) coexist in-scene. The final “inhabit” stance is earned: three years of waiting crystallizes into a renunciation of explanatory mastery, cost felt as the feather dissolves and city goes dark. Relationship with Chen is crucible-light: his exhaustion vs her quiet certitude shift status once he stops watching instruments. Minor slip: “softly ingenious” is label-adjacent, though later embodied in her refusal to hammer mysteries.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Interiority is vivid—“cheerfully gloomy smile,” “bright melancholy”—but the recollectionist never makes a choice that costs her anything; she only observes and exits. The one micro-decision, pocketing the glass, changes nothing on-page. Emotional arc is atmospheric, not causal. Still, her perceptual signature stays sharp and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete, tactile, and music-driven; his contradictions (calculating vs. wonder-seeking) play out in real time through rosin, coin-seeding, and set-list switches. The ivory bishop anchors a credible micro-choice hierarchy—pawn-shop loss vs. tonight’s gamble—yet the promised “dark winter” backstory is only asserted, never dramatized, so the final renunciation feels 90 % earned, 10 % asserted. Still, his body-instrument-tool choreography is vivid and specific enough to clear the 9-quick test bar.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is rich—“obsidian grace,” grandmother-dust as a synapse to memory, body-as-cosmic-chalk—all concrete, never therapeutic. Contradictory impulses (yearn for connection vs. embrace erasure) are simultaneous in scene; her final dance is both surrender and weapon, earned by earlier isolation. Cost is visible: body becomes vellum, dawn becomes execution time. Still, the Council’s faceless tyranny stays abstract, so external-status pressure reads thin.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; his “gift for reading between lines” is dramatized through tactile glass work and the stone-thrown interference experiment. Contradictory impulses—nostalgic preservation vs. transformative revelation—coexist in the same beats, peaking when he caresses the atrium he must soon lose. The final smile is earned: his communion via ripples forecloses despair and crystallizes a legacy stance. Micro-choices (kneeling, pocketed stone, photographing patterns) keep emotion embodied without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is rich, concrete, and embodied—his scarred hands, the tremor before the box, the sense that “molten polyester” is still in his skin. Contradictory impulses (protect/ confess, flee/ teach) coil inside every beat; the micro-choice to open the box and record the message is earned by prior causal weight. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic shorthand—“grief transmuted into something harder and softer than sorrow” flirts with label-speak, but the next sentence grounds it in the gold-sealed cracks, so the balance holds. Closure shows credible renunciation: he descends to expose his cracks to the crew, foreclosing the safety of private shame.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her palm against the gauge, the dream of equations—but the “logical dreamer” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene. The final ascent to “infinity” reads as serene acceptance rather than a costly renunciation, so the closure feels gifted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s inherited perception is concrete—she palms the wall, photographs brittle pages, adds her own whisper—so the “sensitively perceptive” trait keeps turning into physical choices. Interiority stays specific to her craft: she “feels for the subtle vibrations,” not abstract grief. The final notebook placement is a micro-choice that accepts lifelong solitude; cost is legible. Yet the diary entry she reads gives her knowledge faster than it costs her anything, so the beat feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s grief and hope are embodied in every brush-stroke; the “borrowed heartbeat” is never abstract. Interiority stays concrete—“doubled and strange” beats felt in her own chest—so motivation remains legible. No secondary character on scene, so relationship crucible waived; her stance crystallizes when she lays the brush down, cost visible in trembling fingers. Micro-choices (faster brushwork, last spiral) map her value hierarchy cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s grief-into-patience arc is credibly embodied (traces clipboard, kneels to touch grandmother’s mark); the interior contradiction between banner of vengeance and operative gentleness is shown through micro-choices rather than label-speak. However, the leap from “three revenge kills” to “slow art of listening” is asserted in backstory, not dramatized on-page, so the transformative hinge feels slightly schematic rather than earned in scene. The final stance crystallizes with clear cost—she cedes the heroic narrative and positions herself as “just the ones still breathing”—which satisfies the closure gate for earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—destroying ecosystems to archive extinction—rings sharply in the salt-cradle beat; her trembling fingers embody the cost. Yet the amoral-philanthropist motive is declared more than dramatized: “every devastation was calculated preservation” tells us the paradox rather than letting us discover it through a micro-choice on this page. The final bitter smile is credible endurance, but the arc leans on summary of off-stage atrocities rather than new, visible stakes in-scene. Still, the specific image of her as “sole, terrible translator” of dead birdsong gives her a memorable, haunted individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is vivid—celibate seductress untying knots of stolen desire—yet the“harvest of echoes”is absorbed rather than enacted, so agency feels slightly vicarious. Embodied emotion is luscious, but the moment of irrevocable cost is more conceptual than corporeal. Still, the paradox drives every micro-gesture, and the final self-seduction into freedom is credibly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s serenity is palpable in the opening beats—his fingers tracing the stick, the methodical ink-grinding—but the text keeps *telling* us he is “uncommonly serene” instead of letting the contradiction between that calm and the others’ rage tighten his interior. The final smile and brush-touch land as a credible renunciation, yet we never feel the cost of that calm cracking; the “revolutionary’s heart” stays abstract. Still, the micro-choice to stage tomorrow’s show *backwards* is character-specific and irreversible, earning the score.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—“blushing stillness,” fingers on moth dust—and her micro-choices (knotting stems, releasing the wing) externalize the ethno-poetic mission. The story risks thematic ventriloquism by letting the butterfly “read” rather than forcing her to test her faith onstage, but her final, wordless descent shows earned renunciation. A hairline slip: “systems erased from every record” edges toward editorial aside rather than embodied belief.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elsa’s interiority is vivid—her artisan’s fingers “find the rope’s logic intuitive,” a lovely embodiment of vocation. The contradiction between guilt over the lost wax cylinders and her new braiding-casting vocation is dramatized in micro-choices (unbraiding, casting bells) rather than summarized. The only drag is a faint therapeutic self-labeling (“she understood now what the Victorian collectors had been attempting”) that slightly dilutes raw pressure, but her flawed, grieving competence remains legible and drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kira’s paradoxical foresight/hindsight is dramatized through sensory micro-choices—tracing the seal, tasting rust—so interior contradiction is embodied, not labeled. The neural-crown beat forces a visible cost: she laughs “bitter and beautiful,” crystallizing her lifetime stance. Precisely playful surfaces only once as a descriptor, not a tested trait, so the full contradiction punch is lightly missed, but the ending renunciation still lands as Earned Stasis with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s frugality is dramatized through daily survival choices that feed the obsession; her trembling fingers on the tile embody the cost. The interior contradiction—devotion to pure science vs. hunger—is kept alive in scene. Yet her slide from scholar to cosmic gatekeeper is sketched more than dramatized; the final covenant feels slightly abstract because the prior beat shows only recognition, not a visible renunciation or risk. Still, the earned stasis of lifelong sacrifice lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marcus’s scheming pacifism is vividly embodied—his “three moves ahead” smile, the deliberate choice to weaponize silence and memory rather than violence. Interior contradiction flickers when he touches the sanctuary wall and adds this transformation to its memory, showing both strategist and monk. The Magistrate’s arc is equally embodied: grip loosens on box, tears fall without sound, proving the pacifist scheme worked. Cost is felt: the broken pin stays broken—no forced repair, only acceptance—so renunciation lands with tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s tactile, almost synesthetic craft and quiet refusal to chase the impossible feel lived-in; the astronomer’s desperation is equally embodied in how he clutches broken brass. Their synchronized breathing ritual is a credible, pressure-forced micro-choice that reveals mutual stakes. The final gift of the fog-silvered hand mirror crystallizes a cost for both—she relinquishes control, he accepts an unfinished dream—earning the story’s quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-rooted refusal and its gradual erosion under Mira’s pressure are cleanly embodied; the contradictory impulses (protect the past vs. save the eyes) coexist in-scene. The final choice to mend is credibly earned by the orchard’s living proof that rigidity fails. Micro-choices—touching the ribbon, laughing at the “wrong” bag—reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is present but lightly felt; the emotional price could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The curator’s temporal vertigo and recursive mission are viscerally embodied—boots click, tongue thick, she whispers “the bathroom” like a lifeline. Contradictory impulses (obedience to protocol vs surrender to paradox) coexist in-scene, but the epiphany (“inheritance isn’t linear”) is announced more than dramatized with cost, muting the final micro-choice. Still, her flaws (rationalist panic, filial reverence) actively complicate the loop rather than decorate it.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s linguist identity is more label than lived-in: her “expertise in dead languages” is asserted, not embodied through idiosyncratic perception or error. The diary-as-chest move is clever, but interiority stays at a scenic distance—no contradictory impulse under pressure beyond the single offer to “complete the diary.” The renunciation lands cleanly and frees the seekers, so motivation coheres; still, the arc falls short of genuine flaw-driven struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid—her body “carried” an erased twin, the emerald card pulses against her palm—but the moment she must choose between pinning the card or keeping it, the beat is summarized, not dramatized. Coraline’s status as a living contradiction is compelling yet her motives stay declarative (“you can pin it here, forget…”) without a visible cost that squeezes Marina’s choice. The final renunciation is credible because the prior science obsession has been embodied, but the emotional crescendo is slightly under-choreographed; we are told “she would remember” rather than shown the bodily cost of that promise.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara’s calm expertise is well-drawn through tactile micro-choices (sorting pouches, re-braiding rope), and her interior desire “to translate confusion into clarity” is concrete. Yet the final step-through-the-door is more conceptual coup than felt sacrifice; the cost of entering the merged border is asserted, not embodied, so the arc lands as competent rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interiority is concrete and sensorially grounded; her “weathered fingers,” selective attention to fracture lines, and the tactile extraction ritual all embody her vocation. Contradictory impulses—urgency to act versus reverence for stillness—coexist in the same beats, giving her credible tension. The final smile and “quieter heart” are quiet but earned, showing acceptance of a new coexistence rather than victory. The only limit is that her flaw (over-attunement to pattern) never visibly backfires or costs her on-page, so the arc is more discovery than reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s custodian-hermit solitude and refusal to abandon a dead beacon are sharply particularized; her tactile rituals with the prism and tower reveal a hierarchy of values (duty > survival). The retrocognitive gift manifests as embodied sensory overload rather than tidy exposition, and her final micro-choice—aligning darkness instead of light—pays off an interior contradiction between memory-anchoring and future-calling. Cost is visible: seventeen years of tending absence crystallizes into the anti-light beam she births. Only minor slip: “fingers that remembered tomorrow” edges toward poetic convenience, slightly undercutting prior knowledge bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyra’s interiority is textured—her “preemptively nostalgic” stance is lived, not labelled—but the only micro-choice that costs her anything is the final inscription; until then she mostly observes. The contradiction between her archivist training and the impulse to invent memories is hinted yet never weaponised in a scene-level decision. Because no second character shares the forecourt, status/relationship pressure is absent, so the crucible is purely introspective. The endurance of writing is credible, but the lack of an earlier fork or visible trade-off keeps the arc just shy of higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaia’s pyrotechnic chant and tactile know-how give her a memorable signature; the moment she trades her last rocket for the slow-burn knot shows a believable hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—she “feels the crowd’s anticipation” through designer muscle-memory, not abstraction. The final choice to keep launching home-made stars is earned by every mineral she scrapes from the walls, and the cost—exposure, exhaustion, scarce fuel—is visible in the sustained flare. Secondary townsfolk remain functional, but the crucible is her resolve versus the Dimming, and that conflict tightens credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s patient scientific gaze and Chen’s retreat from prophecy form a believable rift; her quiet refusal to accept his fear is shown through micro-gestures with the cicada and the calm offer of the grotto’s mirror-pool. Interiority is concrete—starlight on wet stone, crab-shell tactics—never textbook. The reconciliatory nod is earned because her earlier catalogues of “every ending is… another beginning” have already dramatized her stance; still, the beat is more acquiescence than visible cost, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s shift from bunker‐bred claustrophobia to aerial expansion is embodied in micro-choices—pressing glass, uncorking vials, dancing under inverted gravity—each one tethered to the porcelain doll’s pulse. The contradiction between inherited fear and hunger for open silence drives every beat; her final vial for her father shows cost scaled to length. Interiority stays concrete, never slips into label-speak. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible untested, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s veteran calm and micro-adjustments feel lived-in; his own back-story is efficiently seeded through the vial and late confession, giving the passenger’s arc a credible mirror. The woman’s shift from rigid to receptive is tracked through embodied detail (knuckles, shoulders, breathing) rather than labels. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc leans more instructive than internally torn, but the final smile is proportionate and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Anya’s interiority is concrete—her breath catching at the mural, the ruby flake warming against her hip—yet the moment of renunciation arrives as a poised realization rather than a costly deed. The ‘wisely adventurous’ trait is shown twice (stepping through the cascade, sitting among singing roots) but never punished; no visible flaw complicates her ascent. Because the climax is conceptual, the emotional cost is felt obliquely; still, her choice to dissolve the fragment into collective memory earns a credible stasis that forecloses the throne forever.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The keeper’s interior contradiction—needing to sever love in order to heal darkness—grounds every beat; the doorknocker ring’s return in the final paragraph shows embodied cost. Micro-choices (lifting the shadow, pressing it to her chest) tie directly to her hierarchy of values: solitude as pedagogy. The only slip is a touch of therapy-speak (“suffocation was simply breathing…”) that momentarily abstracts the wound instead of letting the image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—bitter remembrance of the scheme versus wonder at the farm—are alive in-scene; the bolt-turn micro-choice visibly costs her old identity and forecloses retreat. The “virtuously mischievous” tilt shows only in the final quip, not in earlier stakes, keeping her short of full complexity. Still, embodied emotion (palm on cold bolt, laugh as “pure music”) and the earned shift from filtered victim to capstone creator satisfy the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Victoria’s contradictory hunger to know versus her final renunciation is embodied in the tactile crank-handle beats; the micro-choice to lift the needle and later hurl the brass through the glass externalizes the cost (shattered window, lost knowledge). Interiority avoids diagnostic jargon, instead using sensory metaphors (“frequency that had been humming…stopped”). One flaw: lineage backstory arrives in two dense reflective blocks (>20%), slightly flattening present-moment pressure before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Aldric’s solitude-isolation and latent hunger for language are viscerally embodied; his decision to speak the oath feels inevitable yet costly. Interiority stays concrete—armor “dissolving” into possibility, blood-seeds sprouting—so transformation is felt, not declared. The only drag: we never see the contradiction that once kept him silent; the renunciation is pure surrender, not a visible clash of values. Still, the wooden hand he clasp charges every later image with the price of leaving human form.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied—finger tracing dust “like braille,” button warming in palm. Contradictory impulses (obsession vs. resignation) coexist in scene, driving the micro-choice to return the button and index Walsh. Earned renunciation: he forecloses personal revelation tonight, accepting archival stewardship as cost. Minor slip: “some wounds required archaeology” drifts toward diagnostic abstraction, slightly blunting peak embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mira’s quietly obsessive scholarship (“anger without knowledge is just noise”) gives her interiority a serrated edge that lifts her above stock rebel. The brass key’s weight in her palm and the micro-choice to read star-maps in puddles embody her resourcefulness; her refusal to join the doomed senior cell shows earned, costly stance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and Jakob is more echo than crucible, but her lone arc lands with visible forfeiture of safety. Meets the 9+ quick test on renunciation/causality despite secondary-character flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his cheeks fill without releasing, fingers hover above keys—and the prophecy-as-family-burden motive is clear. The shift from solo to collective restraint shows credible endurance, yet the other musicians remain silhouettes; no status or relationship pressure tests him. The final “burden lifting” is asserted rather than embodied; we see no contradicting impulse that would make the renunciation costly. Still, his flaws (inheritance, secrecy) drive the action and the silence tactic feels idiosyncratic, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is consistently concrete—fingertips tingling with “forgotten memories,” moss erupting from her touch—yet her contradictory impulses (duty to report vs. urge to build cairns) remain stated rather than enacted in a single observable beat. The final transformation is foreshadowed by lineage and leaf-letters, so the cost feels legible, but the moment of irrevocable change is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible micro-choice. Still, her perceptual signature (sorting by “size, shimmer, and song”) is character-specific and threads every paragraph, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost but not quite.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—clinging to repair while gravitating toward surrender—surfaces in concrete micro-moments: touching the fused compass, suspending it, finally mapping the “discord into harmony.” His renunciation of fixing is earned by the iterative beats with the greenhouse leaves, so the final stance carries cost. The emotional embodiment stays specific (“perpetual dampness that rust loved,” “swirling leaves…never settling”) rather than diagnostic. Only the delivery woman offers a fleeting status shift; no secondary pressure is sustained, so relationship-as-crucible is inactive, capping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vera’s contradictory impulse—helping Mira while guarding her own maimed past—surfaces in micro-gestures (hand to cheek, vial choice) but never fully collides; the interior shift is declared rather than dramatized at the furnace beat. Mira’s surrender of the coin and her smile register change, yet the cost (“wonder isn’t about being perfect”) is voiced, not embodied. Relationship as crucible heats, but the decisive stance crystallizes off-stage; still, both women feel singular, not trope-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s vocation, perceptual bias, and micro-choice to sit and hum off-key are vivid; the “modestly fearless” trait is shown rather than labeled. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, so the interiority is coherent but not yet layered. Thomas’s ghost is sketched through gesture (tuning phantom strings) rather than internal access, adequate for a secondary on-page presence. The final smile is earned through her cause-and-effect guidance, yet lacks a visible cost to her, capping the arc at “strong” rather than “exceptional.”

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interiority is visceral and embodied—every nerve, angle, and gram of the mask is felt. The shift from recorded pain to reciprocal mercy is credibly traced through micro-calculations and the final kneel. The child beat is thin—no reciprocal gesture or resistance—so the relational crucible never fully ignites. Still, Lyra’s hierarchy of values is legible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s “gift” stays abstract—no embodied contradiction or micro-choice lets us feel it trip her up. The grandmother hand-sign memory is recalled, not dramatized, so the motive to “honor overlooked histories” is declared, not strained. Interiority drifts toward thesis (“Some things are too precious for museums”) instead of live tension. Still, her trembling fingers and the final pocketing of the map show a hierarchy of values with cost, earning a solid mid-8.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s guilt-driven vocation is vivid; his embodied reactions to the dead and the toolbox weight work. Internal contradiction—comfort with ghosts yet dread of their evidence—shows in how he handles the journals. The final micro-choice (winding the spring while lights stay off) crystallizes his new burden. Cost is felt, but the grandmother backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so motivation’s full pressure is slightly blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Moth’s solitary perfectionism and her eventual surrender to paradox are believably rooted in her craft; the silent rupture moment forces a genuine, costly renunciation of her life’s work. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through tactile letterpress and frost images rather than abstract labels. The only thinning occurs in the multi-self epiphany, where the “every possible version” line edges toward diagnostic shorthand, slightly diluting embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cassia’s ex-revolutionary identity is concrete—her prison poems, her tactical eye for the “memory maps,” the way defeat has burnished rather than dulled her. The moment she angles the shard and the Venusians whisper back, her history and present motive fuse: she recognizes their last-ditch preservation because she once tried the same. Interior contradiction shows when her voice grows “thick with an emotion she couldn’t quite name,” revealing both longing and self-reproach. The final plan is earned: only someone who has already lost everything would dare promise resurrection to the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied—his skin "wilting" when lies approach is a sharp sensory hook. His final micro-choice to tether the chip to every box, not just the one, crystallizes a hierarchy of values (truth over self-preservation) with visible cost: Vex's rust-death. The only slip is a slightly over-tidy smile at the instant of cosmic reversal; a flicker of terror would have made the contradiction live in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vera’s motives—petrichor collector, psychometry seeker, granddaughter—interlock cleanly and drive every micro-choice; her refusal to step through the wall in the final beat crystallizes a hierarchy of values that has been embodied, not declared. Interiority is tactile and mineral-damp, never diagnostic: “her collection vials clinking softly against her hip” is both body and identity. The compass vision sequence dramatizes contradictory impulses (stay/surrender) in-scene, not in summary. Cost is visible: she climbs out “breathing factory dust,” vial warm, path foreclosed—Earned Stasis with limestone breath still in her lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—her need to keep carving yet surrender to the storm’s time-fold—is embodied in the warmth of the slide and the micro-choices of each cut. The “wood remembers” refrain and the blade’s grain-following motion dramatize her perpetual learning trait so it costs her the chance to leave early. Earned Stasis arrives when she tucks the sculpture and the van’s engine turns over without the GPS: she accepts an unmapped life, price visible in the rear-view mirror of the arch. Hairline slip: the final line’s “reimagined by the storm” drifts toward diagnostic self-label; still, the contradiction holds.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Mara’s quietly-driven obsession is credibly rooted in the inherited postcards, and her decision to paint the pavilion at night is a concrete micro-choice that costs her sleep and social life; the interior contradiction between public artist and secret keeper is shown, not told. The final renunciation—leaving the postcards for the next initiate—carries visible emotional cost and is earned by the year-long obsession. However, the absence of any second on-page character keeps relational pressure off the page, so the crucible is purely internal; this is acceptable at this length but caps the score below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Amara’s grief-shock at the diary’s touch is visceral, her “hands tremble” under the weight of history, yet her interiority turns diagnostic (“retrocognitively trapped”) rather than embodied. The choice to descend and arrange debris crystallizes her hierarchy of values—archive over safety—but Marcus’s flickering ghost does most of the explanatory labor, blunting her agency. Still, the final stance—transcribing ugly truth—carries earned cost and individuates her from a generic “archivist” type.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silas’s interiority is vivid—his refusal to shatter the bottle (“he rejected such false comfort”) crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The memory-bridge act is embodied, not told, and the cost (hours of corporeal drain, bottle crumbling to dust) is on-page. Yet the moment of epiphany—“he had conceived rebirth”—leans into summary rather than a final micro-choice, blunting the edge of earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Matthias’s interior contradiction—preserver of extinct emotions vs. solitary witness to apocalypse—remains vivid; the childhood flashback anchors his obsession and the final endurance of sitting among the trees costs him any chance of escape. No second character on stage, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The micro-choice to immerse the shaving triggers the prophecy beat and is earned by earlier cataloguing labor. Earned Stasis qualifies: he forecloses evacuation and accepts annihilation with visible cost (“Below, the waters continued rising”).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—she “feels the ridged texture” and sorts “entropy from chaos”—and her three-century longevity is shown through tactile memory, not exposition. The “furiously tranquil” contradiction drives her micro-choices (steady breath, dancing hands) and the final planting carries visible cost: she accepts sole stewardship of folded time. No secondary character appears, so relationship bullets are N/A; her flaw—willingness to shoulder causality-breaking power—compounds across beats and is accepted, not cured, at closure. Voice remains individuated, never sliding into therapy-speak; the earned stasis feels scaled to 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s “prefer listening over noise” is dramatized through her refusal to trust the electronic panel alone; the bell-rope choice embodies her trait with bodily cost (rope burn echo, shouted warning). Interiority is concrete—pressure felt in bones, grandmother’s proverb—without label-speak. One contradiction pulses: credibly curious scientist yet spiritually attuned, both impulses active as she reads impossible barometric data. The earned renunciation—staying alone in the sanctuary—caps her arc with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Interior contradiction is subtle but present: “obsolete post” vs. “devotion that bordered on prayer” seeds the later reversal. The final renunciation—choosing to remain vulnerable—pays off prior causality (“every scar…had prepared them”), though the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “careful steps of someone who had learned that survival meant noticing everything while disturbing nothing” shows embodied habit—but the decisive turn (accepting custodianship of silence) is declared, not dramatized. The grandfather’s “tranquil perception” is stated repeatedly; we never see it complicate an on-page choice. No contradictory impulse is enacted in scene; the arc is a single, steady dawning. Still, the final renunciation carries a palpable cost—“luminous weight”—that justifies the stoic endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus’s “borrowed-time” status is vivid—he registers duration as “rough sandpaper of anxiety… silk of contentment”—but his arc is almost entirely internal realization, with no micro-choice that visibly costs him. The epiphany that he must teach others is told, not dramatized; we never see him decide or renounce anything under pressure. Because the climax is summary, the emotional cost feels abstract rather than embodied. Interiority is strong, but the absence of a paid, fork-in-the-road moment caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mira’s quiet-poet identity is anchored in tactile ritual (notebook, feather, tidepool) and a credible seven-year habit; her micro-choice to help the boy re-weave the kite shows a visible cost—she pauses her own poem and risks being misunderstood. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “understanding” lands as a gentle nod rather than a contradictory impulse under fire, so the arc feels more observational than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mira’s interiority stays concrete—her trembling hand on the pillar, the tumor as live antenna—yet the diary-voice sometimes slips into abstract thesis (“the caretaker’s role is to die at the correct frequency”). The contradiction between her systematic precision and bodily fragility is dramatized, but the final readiness feels slightly accelerated; causality is intact, cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elena’s “luminous skepticism” is asserted more than dramatized; her interiority leans on abstract labels (“academic rebellion,” “brilliant and impossible”) rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice of placing the amber on the scanner is the only visible decision that costs her something, and even that is under-written. Because the prior beats never force her to act against her skepticism, the final assent feels pre-scripted rather than personally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Coachman’s quiet, ritualized agency is consistent; his multilingual plant-whispering and bird-listening give a concrete, idiosyncratic lens. Interior contradiction is muted—no moment where his resolve or guilt is stress-tested on the page—so the arc feels more processional than transformative. Still, embodied detail (pods rattle “like old bones,” knees press into shrapnel) keeps him particular and grounds the final renunciation. Cost is present but generalized—“garden will grow without him”—rather than personally paid in a single visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Contradictory impulses ripple through her nose-versus-leaf skepticism and the later surrender to ancestral magnetism; the howl at the end is earned. Her micro-choice to leave retirement is embodied when she palms the amber and breathes “following a scent.” No interior diagnostic chatter; the war-scarred refusal to trust smell alone is shown in the twitch of her muzzle rather than labeled. Flaws (age, fading senses) complicate tactics and remain uncompensated.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her palm on the compass rose, the warmth pulsing, the taffy image of stretched time—yet the contradiction between loneliness and saviorhood stays mostly summarized, not dramatized with on-page micro-choices that risk or cost her. The final “she continued sketching” crystallizes her stance, but the jump from curse to compass feels more declarative than earned by visible beats of sacrifice. Still, within 800 words the arc from isolation to lighthouse is credible and specific to her sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Renn’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “reading emanations,” the warm lid against her chest—but the master remains a void; we’re told he “disappeared” and “never understood,” never shown why his failure matters to her. The “sacredly playful” ethos is asserted, not dramatized; we see coins returned, but no on-scene contradiction that tests her loyalties under pressure. The final stance—choosing wonder over certainty—lands cleanly, but the emotional cost is more declared (“she understood”) than embodied.

    Marina’s contradictory drives—documenting truth while erasing herself—are dramatized in embodied beats (the sole-tapped spellings, the thumb on a ring gesture she catalogs). Her choice to stay and “unbind memory from myth” is the earned renunciation that costs her any public vindication; the chessboard’s hollow squares externalize the price. Interiority avoids label-speak, using physical ritual to show her flattening affect under conspiracy fatigue. Voice stays individual: her taxonomy of “seconds of meaning” feels like the obsession of one who has inhaled too much smoke and cameras.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The seer’s contradictory impulses—addiction to prophecy vs. ache for soil—live in her fingertips: she “navigates…by trailing her fingers along leather spines” and later kneels to “press the stone deep into the earth.” The mercury blindness and gardener past are not labels; they collide in the final renunciation of visions for planting, costing her the only future-seeing she has left. No other character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; interiority stays concrete, never sliding into therapy-speak. The only micro-drag is a slight over-explanation of “what she’d been searching for,” but the embodied cost of burying the stone keeps motivation earned.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kaspar’s guilt, self-taught re-visioning, and final forgiveness are tracked through tactile micro-choices (thread-pulling, copper offering) that externalize interior change; the contradictory impulse—self-blame vs. desire to teach again—remains active throughout. The emotional arc is specific to a tutor’s professional shame rather than generic regret, and the earned renunciation (leaving the board, accepting imperfect moves) carries visible cost in the final image. No secondary character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; headcount stays within default.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—“chill seep through her skin,” “smiled, her work complete”—and her climb is a credible micro-choice chain. The contradiction between mischievous child-turned-artist and deliberate insurgent is implied but not fully dramatized in-scene; we’re told rather than shown the instant she risks capture. Because the stakes leap from whispered line to systemic uprising without an on-page beat that tests her resolve, the final stance feels slightly over-calibrated. Still, the embodied sensory detail and the cost of permanent echo keep her above the safety middle.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“acid tang burning her throat,” trembling hands). The contradiction between her guilt over poisoned seas and her stubborn refusal to evacuate is dramatized through the micro-choice to keep narrating while cables snap. Her final smile while clutching the charm shows an earned renunciation of survival in favor of story-preservation, visible cost paid on the page. Minor slip: “both stubborn and broken” is a touch diagnostic, but immediately counter-weighed by sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s “intimately aloof” stance is dramatized in the first beat—she sets up away from the quay bustle—and is re-paid in the cave when solitude becomes genetic legacy. The contradiction (tender/distant) is held in embodied gesture, not label. The final micro-choice—placing her own shell—earns the grandmother’s renunciation as an inherited cost. Only the grandmother remains off-page, so status/relationship crucible is N/A; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority pulses with embodied contradiction—her trembling fingers on the vial yet steady voice calling Thomas, the simultaneous fury of forgiveness and the ache of wanting to touch the untouchable. The micro-choice to uncork the jasmine is concrete, character-specific, and costly: she risks confirming the town’s verdict of madness if the scent fails to summon him. Her flaw—refusing to relinquish love to death—drives every beat and compounds across the spiral stairs. The reunion is credible because her prior obsessive purification of intent has literally changed the rules of reality; the cost is that Thomas returns half-luminous, never again fully human, a living reminder that her love now cages them both in altered physics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s endurance as “voice in the darkness” is credibly rooted in her flood trauma and grandmother relic; the renunciation to stay is felt. Interior contradiction—longing to migrate vs duty to guide—is dramatized, not told. Micro-choices (bracing the bronze foot against crank while whispering star-paths) embody hierarchy of values. Flaw (waning-strength) complicates every physical beat; no safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s involuntary truthfulness is dramatized through compulsive self-exposure on the slope; the decision to drink the mixture crystallizes her hierarchy of needs (sleep, daughter, dignity) with visible trembling hands. The interior contradiction—yearning for silence yet fearing its moral cost—stays live in scene. Cost is legible: the clouded eye in pocket and the phrase “uncertain future” foreclose a path of pure honesty. Missing 9+ only because the change itself is slightly under-dramatized; we are told the silence arrives rather than feeling it crackle through her body.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Magnus’s interior contradiction—gift as curse, longing for memories he both hoards and fears—plays out in embodied beats: the salt-cracked palm, the press of brittle petals to temple. His micro-choice to time the lighthouse rotations against his pulse reveals obsession under pressure, and the final pin-prick of the Edelweiss to his lapel is a renunciation that costs him solitude he had perfected. The absent son is felt as secondary pressure, but because he never appears on stage, status dynamics and voice distinction bullets are waived. What keeps this from 9.0 is that the moment of greatest emotional risk—the recognition that he forgot his own wedding—is filtered through lyrical paraphrase rather than a vivid flash that forces an immediate bodily reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s interior life is palpably rendered through tactile obsession with maps and the chip; the grandfather promise, though recounted, is anchored to a present object and triggers the decisive trek. His choice to follow the ants crystallizes a credible shift from voyeur of journeys to participant, the matrix chip cooling in pocket a quiet cost. Empirical intuition is shown (fingertips knowing forged from real) rather than told, and the final stance is earned. Still, the cavern epiphany leans slightly abstract, muting the embodied contradiction that could have pushed this into 9-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Seraphina’s interiority is vivid—her “familiar rage” and sense of shackled royalty—but the moment of transformation is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost feels abstract rather than corporeal. The contradiction between duty and revolt is stated more than enacted; we see no micro-choice that seals her fate, only resignation. The firefly-queens are a resonant image, yet she joins them without a final, visible decision beat. Motivation is clear, but the culminating beat is soft; hence the score.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyra’s contradictory drive—science vs. memory—stays embodied (shell twist, calibrating fingers) and peaks when she risks the nexus with Marcus as witness; the cost (three lost years, cooled reactor) is felt. Interiority slips once into “scientifically romantic” label-speak, muting immediacy. Relationship pressure alters the dyad’s state: Marcus’s whisper becomes the catalyst she has to witness, not solve. Earned stasis: she accepts non-replication, trading certainty for return-difference.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.9)
    Maya’s longing for linear time is vivid and embodied, but her decisive moment—“might as well begin by falling”—feels more rhetorical than earned; no prior beat shows her testing, doubting, or risking flight, so the renunciation lands without visible cost. Interior contradiction is strong (envy of every self but the present), yet micro-choices under pressure are summarized rather than dramatized. The chronology tangle is label-rich; we’re told she “can’t remember dying” but never see memory’s grip slip in real time. Result: compelling voice, insufficiently staged agency.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s interiority is textured through tactile substitution of lost smell; the micro-choice to leave the screw deliberately loose externalizes her empathy and earns the tender closure. Mrs. Huang’s single line of dialogue and trembling hands supply enough embodied contradiction to make the grief legible. No head-count or status issues; aromatherapist past is anchored to present action via touch-based diagnostics. The −0.4 gap to 9+ is the absence of a visible cost to Mara herself—her gift feels pure, not personally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s crystallizing skin is embodied beautifully; the held-breath beat forces a visible cost as the crystals fall like glittering dust, making her final rune feel earned. Interiority stays specific—“the familiar geography of her stress-born scars” is vivid and particular—yet the epiphany about “boi = vessel” arrives as an abrupt etymological hand-wave rather than a dramatized contradiction, softening the motivational punch. Still, the arc from shame to self-authorship is legible and tied to one concrete object she physically creates. Meets 9- gate but not quite the hairline-free finish needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s guilt and need to atone are embodied in her shaky inhalation of the perfume; the micro-choice to collaborate rather than expel cleanly reverses her prior stance and costs her professional identity. Marcus/Elisabetta registers as one fused, morally ambiguous agent whose composed duality pressures Vera without degenerating into polite ghost cliché. Interiority avoids therapy-speak; instead, bergamot and sawdust carry the emotional freight. The earned renunciation—writing a slanted column that confesses complicity—caps the arc with visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaia’s contradictory impulses—clutch the dictionary vs. scatter its pages—coexist in the same breath, showing interior contradiction in scene. The embodied “resounding hush” and the laugh that contains all/no sound give visceral, non-generic emotion. Micro-choice of walking the golden spiral under literal apocalyptic countdown creates visible, scaled cost. Final renunciation—forgetting/remembering across iterations—lands as earned stasis with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shepherd’s interior contradiction—clinging to a defunct key while orchestrating the flawless hydraulic count—embodies the story’s obsession with distance, not time. Her embodied micro-choices (turning the key against her palm, syncing breath to valves) externalize the conflict between mechanical memory and fluid present. The cost is palpable: she never re-joins the valley’s living clocks, instead accepting perpetual exile on the cliff. Only the “razor edge” epiphany feels slightly performative; the phrasing drifts toward thesis-statement, trimming the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s nervous laser-clicking and spatial mapping feel specific; the late epiphany about Chen is credible because the mushrooms literalize her walled-off habit. Interiority stays concrete, but the final phone call is a micro-choice whose cost is only asserted (“learned to let the light pass”) rather than dramatized on the page, capping the arc just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elena’s contradictory motives—academic certainty vs. filial chaos—are palpable, but her final “smile” is an unearned therapy-speak epiphany; we never see a micro-choice that proves she accepts the cost of her father’s addiction. The stranger’s entrance feels engineered to voice the theme rather than apply pressure, so the interior turn reads diagnostic rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s vocation and solitude are credibly particularized; the glass-disc-as-emotional-tuning-fork gives embodied, character-specific interiority without label-speak. Yet his stakes plateau: he “waits” for the same call each night, so no higher-stakes choice or visible cost crystallizes—the ending merely restates the ritual. The interior contradiction (lonely yet addicted to distance) is declared, not dramatized in a beat that risks real loss. Closure is Charged Poise, but the stance feels pre-decided, so the renunciation costs less than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—preserve Eleanor’s peace vs. expose Thomas’s erasure—coexist in the micro-choice of the codicil; the walnut-stained fingers that close around the locket embody the visible cost of that fusion. Interiority stays concrete, never abstracting into label-speak, and the final renunciation (carrying both truth and mercy) is fully earned by the prior archival sleuthing. Only the slightest emotional ventriloquism in Eleanor’s “Thank you” keeps this from a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sadie’s interior contradiction—glib humor vs. bone-deep loneliness—surfaces in every tactic; the moon-rock trade and phone hand-off crystallize her hierarchy of values. Marcus’s stunned passivity and instant enlistment feel credible because his desperation is shown via the vial’s illegal provenance. No stock “orphan savior” therapy-speak; her mask slips only once, and the cost is the eternal exit into rumor. The only cap: we never see her genuinely wrong-footed, so the flaw feels curated, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interior contradiction—blind seer, cartographer of the unseeable—anchors every beat; her embodied diction (“Portuguese flooded through her skin”) fuses trait to action. The ring’s warming spin and her barefoot soil-reading show micro-choices that tighten stakes. Cost is legible: she forfeits outer sight for inner maps, paid in the final stillpoint where she “became the destination.” No secondary character appears; pressure is self-forged and credible. Minor therapy-speak (“source of all maps”) keeps it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the mis-routed fleet vs. hunger for cosmic knowledge—are dramatized in the moment she grips the dead pen and chooses to transmit both coordinate sets. The interiority stays concrete, anchored to tactile objects (pen, starlight, alarm chime) rather than labels. Cost is legible: she knowingly preserves her error and the scientific breakthrough it birthed. The “confidently uncertain” stance is lived, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—arthritic joints, the ache of beauty without sound—yet her contradictory impulses (clinging to silence while mapping it into form) stay mostly summary-level; the camera ritual is shown, the refusal to re-enter sound is embodied, but the pivotal turn to accept Chen’s co-creation is slightly under-motivated, arriving as tender affirmation rather than pressured choice. Chen’s quietly charismatic pull is dramatized only in one beat; her status as former interpreter is told, not tested under pressure. The cost of forty years of erasure is felt, yet the final smile feels more benediction than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira’s arsonist past and genetic memory compel her choices, but the “volcanic tenderness” is asserted more than embodied; no tactile contradiction shows beneath pressure. The moment she touches the tapestry is strong, yet the interior shift from destroyer to keeper is summarized, not dramatized with a visible micro-choice that costs her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s quietly rebellious drumming and final stance are motive-consistent and escalate; interiority stays concrete (“Each tap… created ripples”). Cost is felt in her bodily dissolution, but the beat-level contradiction is more asserted than dramatized in-scene, keeping her just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s gait-reading skill and layered-map method are concrete, but his internal contradiction—quiet pride versus need for recognition—stays summary. The coin’s hand-off to Chen is a visible micro-choice that costs him his talisman, yet the emotional price feels scaled to parable more than person. Interiority relies on port-maintenance argot; we get competent craftsman but not intimate contradiction under live pressure. Still, the earned renunciation lands cleanly, satisfying the 9+ test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s silence is credibly rooted in vocation rather than pathology, and her “spiralingly calm” body language shows contradictory impulses (stillness vs. kinetic shutter work). Thomas’s grief is embodied through posture and dockside vigil, not diagnostic labels. The hand-off of the dental mirror is a micro-choice that crystallizes her value hierarchy—service over self—and costs her the tool that earlier enabled her teaching. Relationship-as-crucible is light because Thomas remains largely recipient, not co-agent, but his visible tear-tracked departure shows altered state.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Contradictory impulses are sketched—Marcus both shelters and endangers Elena—but they stay verbal, not dramatized on the board. The final “checkmate” line is earned, yet the cost (Elena’s father, the town’s reprisal) is asserted, not shown. Interiority is vivid (“he heard its ancient warnings”) but leans on stock phrasing; still, the hierarchy of values (children > regime) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—binding her chest while longing for the island—grounds every beat; the unbinding is embodied, costly, witnessed. Torven’s pivot from gruff claim to vulnerable asking gives him credible depth and pressures her choice. Relationship shift alters both selves, not romance but mutual recognition, cleanly earned. Minor slip: “magnificent” is a touch abstract for peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Interiority is stark and embodied—her “flat as pressed paper” voice and “impossible lightness” bird crystallize a woman who has weaponized dissociation. Contradictory impulses (comfort vs complicity) simmer beneath the monotone, never named yet legible. Micro-choices—accepting the bouquet, the final swap to Mrs. Chen’s own flat narration—are causally tied to the earned stasis. Moral ambiguity is lived, not labeled: she profits from grief-loopholes yet genuinely re-sculpts sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is richly embodied—bone-level vibration of quartz, breath visible in chill—and his seven-year exile motivates every step. The moment he begins to dance, contradictory impulses (awe vs. vengeance vs. longing) coil in the same muscle, earning the climactic “tremor of certainty.” Micro-choices—palm on pillar, robe catching light—reveal hierarchy of values without exposition. Cost is legible: the lake cracks under his feet, exile’s boundary dissolved; no path back remains.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s color-blind perception drives every negotiation; her “gray” reading of Enzo’s tremor and the reed tongue trade is concrete, embodied, and costly. The flower-code micro-choices visibly tighten his grief and reopen contact with his daughter, earning the reunion. Interiority stays particular to her synesthetic seeing; no diagnostic labels. Only minor cap: we never feel a moment where her flaw nearly costs her the deal—risk stays intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—yearning for the old ritual while sensing its hollowness—drives every bell stroke; the carbide lens as inherited bias literally reframes what she sees, so her improvisation is motivated and costs her the safety of tradition. Embodied emotion is strong: “the title feels hollow” in her pocket, shoulders remembering choreography while mind “rewrites.” Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—she risks the guard’s censure and her own identity as “bell ringer” to choose rough, unauthorised music. Only drawback: the moment of highest cost (crowd’s uncertain humming) is slightly summarized, not fully dramatized, so the renunciation is clear but the price is more declared than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elena’s grief-hardened interiority is specific and embodied—her steady hands once trembled, candlelight glints on silver wire. The origami crane her fingers fold while listening to the widow is a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values: gift over sale, future over past. Contradictory impulses (tattoo stencil designed for her own skin yet un-inked) stay alive in scene, not summary. Final smile still “feeling foreign” shows cost scaled to length; renunciation of suicide is legible without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Vera’s interiority is vivid—her noticing of ghost data, her generational reflex to map migrations—but the contradiction that should power her is only asserted (“steadily curious nature”). Marcus functions as appreciative straight-man; no status friction or micro-choice tests her. The ending renunciation honors the 43-day rhythm, yet the cost is conceptual, not dramatized through Vera’s body or wallet. Still, within 800 words the portrait is specific enough to feel individual rather than trope.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s seventeen-year preparation and chaotic gait give her a concrete, embodied interiority that drives every beat; the final self-poisoning crystallizes her contradictory impulses (thief vs. filter) with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: archive breach → inhale plague → dance out transformed. Motive stays character-bound; no diagnostic self-talk. Closure choice is earned by prior pattern-training and pays in irreversible bodily change.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s thirty-year devotion to the dream-archive grants her instant credibility; the stone’s cross-temporal grip on her attention feels like an organic obsession rather than a plot convenience. The closing renunciation—she will “tend them through the waiting darkness”—is earned by every preceding frame of footage she has parsed. Interiority stays concrete (“fingers trailing along walls that hummed”), never drifting into label-speak. The only minor drag is the faint saintly halo that softens her edges—no visible flaw complicates her resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s interiority is specific and embodied—trembling fingers, the tactile memory of inserting bio-chips—so her later micro-choice to suture the tail feels earned. The contradiction between savior and exploiter pulses in scene, not summary. The final renunciation (public confession) carries visible cost—sanctuary’s closure, her freedom—so the arc satisfies the 9+ test even though the chameleon itself is more victim than relationship crucible. Voice remains coherent and individual; no diagnostic label-speak intrudes on the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maya’s interior contradiction—wounding herself to invite healing—remains concrete and embodied; the garden-whisper epiphany is earned because her scar-tunnels literally let the green chorus in. Micro-choices (pressing palm to glass, re-turning the hourglass) visibly trace her shifting hierarchy: curiosity > self-protection. Final stance (“some wounds were meant to stay open”) costs her the fantasy of closure; the plants’ confirmation makes the price legible. Dialogue absent, so relationship crucible not required; single-POV voice stays coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. aching identification with the letters—drives every tactile micro-choice (kissing the strip, tucking it into her coat). The final theft is earned: her fingers have been confessing for her all night. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is waived; her conflict with the building-as-confessor is sufficient. Embodied emotion (“tasting silver and salt”) keeps diagnostic label-speak absent.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lyra’s wonder-locked interiority is vivid (“she could hear them again—the unspoken words of the stars”), but her motivation remains ornamental—no contradictory impulse or micro-choice tests her obsession. The final surrender is lyrically rendered yet causally under-motivated; we see no cost foreshadowed that makes dissolution feel inevitable. Emotional states are embodied, but the absence of a genuine decision beat keeps the arc shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kess’s guard-duty mission is concrete (“cultivate the sparks”), but interior contradiction—dreamless yet lullaby-keeper—stays lyric rather than enacted in a micro-choice. The pirate encounter forces one visible tactic (singing to collapse wave-functions) that costs her nothing on-page; endurance is declared, not felt. Competence dominates over flawed struggle; we never witness a mis-charm that endangers cargo. Freeze-frame clock-touch reads as ritual habit, not escalating gamble—stakes plateau.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Stray Philosopher’s interiority is texture-rich—probability streams, “wild frontier,” “careful garden of philosophy”—but his decisions are interior epiphanies rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The climax is a realization (“sudden clarity”) not a visible act; cost is implied rather than dramatized, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged. The voice remains consistent and character-specific, yet the absence of a clear, irreversible choice caps the score below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina's shift from leash-tight fear to open-handed release is embodied in the micro-choice of touching the blank ticket; the contradictory impulse to chase yet confess her deeper need lands cleanly. The ferry guides function less as characters than as oracular furniture, so relationship pressure is absent, but her interior arc is sharply particularized. Closure carries visible cost: the punched star-shaped hole literalizes the loss of control she must accept. Voice stays inside her perceptual frame; no diagnostic self-talk intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s frost-bitten loyalty and Elena’s throat-scarred return both embody “seraphically mundane,” but the interior contradiction—his need to serve vs. her need to remain silent—stays stated rather than enacted in a single shared beat. The bolt-talisman and stair-worn mark are concrete, yet the final rapprochement is summarized, not pressured; we are told “safety wasn’t found in silence or sound” instead of watching a micro-choice that costs either of them on the spot. Elena’s seven-year surgical endurance is visible, but Marcus’s regenerated nerves never translate into a moment where the tingling forces a fumble or revelation that changes tactics. The reunion is tender, yet the crucible moment where their relationship actually shifts under pressure is elided, leaving the change credible but not fully earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Syln’s quiet custodial devotion is embodied in every gesture; her refusal of crowns and her meticulous ink-making ground the titan bloodline’s gravitas. The moment she offers the pellet and demands “Your blood, nephew,” her calm stakes a claim that feels inevitable because we have watched her weigh centuries of silence. Interior contradiction is subtle—she neither gloats nor mourns, only tends—yet that very restraint becomes the cost she pays: perpetual witness. The true heir’s entrance is affect-light, but Syln’s prior choices have already foreclosed any other outcome, so the emotional arc completes through her.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lena’s interiority is concrete and sensorily anchored; the tapping habit, diary fragments, and reflected face build a consistent perceptual signature. Contradictory impulses—scientific duty vs. ancestral pull—coexist in scene, powering the final dive. The cost is felt: she jettisons the atlas page and moors herself to a transformed world, foreclosing a safe return. Only minor hedge: “determined eyes” skirts cliché, but the embodied rhythm pattern compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira’s barefoot vulnerability and inherited opera-glasses quirk are concrete and embodied; her circle-walk micro-choices escalate from curiosity to strategic resolve. The “awkward confidence” trait shows in off-balance gait that steadies as she decodes the stones, making the final stance feel earned. Interiority avoids therapy-speak: “the hum…settled behind her sternum” is sensory, not labeled. Cost is visible: she forfeits the safety of passive waiting and accepts the risk of reigniting a failed rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Chen’s interiority is vivid—“the Earth’s own insurgent spirit” rising through her bones—and her micro-choice to pour the solvent is grounded in plant-whispers and embodied memory. The insurgent circle stays functional backdrop; Li’s only beat is a warning, so relationship crucible is waived. Telepathy trait is shown, not told, and the final smile carries visible cost as her eighty-year body commits to irreversible release. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ test isn’t quite met, but the portrayal is individual, flawed, and stakes-scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Embodied interiority is precise: the tremor read as “memory approaching,” palms hot with anger, cedar bark as stillness-anchor. Contradictory impulses—panic vs. intentional freeze—are dramatized in real time, not summarized. Micro-choice to transplant the sapling crystallizes her hierarchy: growth over grief, with dirt under nails as visible cost. Flaw (quiet talent) directly shapes the pruning action; no diagnostic clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, cracked laugh, charcoal-stained choices. The contradiction between needing to paint truth and watching faces fracture is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final self-portrait across tarot cards earns its cost: she renounces the old single-image art with visible grief. Only the “three faces” shorthand flirts with label-speak, keeping her just outside the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tracker’s “serene anger” and years-long obsession give her a sharp, consistent through-line; the micro-choices—spilling ink, decoding wind-scraped sand, letting the camp dissolve—are character-specific and advance knowledge. Interiority stays concrete (“time stretched like taffy”) rather than clinical. The final shift from rage to understanding is foreshadowed and costs her the safety of certainty, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s interior contradiction—oath vs. truth—drives every micro-choice; the heat-ink letter embodies embodied emotion and stakes. The cascade-failure choice carries visible cost (career, life, world-order). One slip: “terrible peace” flirts with label-speak, blunting peak embodiment a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s pacifism is shown through embodied ritual, not label; the moment she withholds haste to protect the roses’ “meditation” crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Father’s micro-choice to sheath the weapon atop her soil links bounty-hunter identity to her ethic, earning the final quiet. Interiority stays concrete, but one beat drifts toward “teaching them to weave continuity” — a near-thematic echo that softens the contradiction in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Kova’s calm discipline, embodied silence, and zig-zag mimicry of the stars create a coherent, individuated fisher. The interior contradiction between practiced stillness and hammering heart is dramatized in-scene, and the final acceptance of the goddess-echo costs her prior solitary identity, visible when she walks home already changed, humming winter-blooming lullabies.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Margot’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth vs. empire loyalty—play out in live micro-choices (nib handling, letter sealing). Her final renunciation of honesty costs her a private reckoning, foreclosing the path of revelation; the seal-in-vault beat makes the price legible. Observant trait and family flaw feel idiosyncratic, not label-driven. No status/second-character crucible to test: headcount forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her tattooing needles click, the amber warms against bone—but the “meteor hush” is repeated so often it starts to feel like a label rather than lived contradiction. Her final quiet exit is earned because every spectral tether she inks costs her amber a fracture, a believable price. Flaw: the “baby-cry translator” trait is asserted, never tested or traded off under pressure; it stays ornamental. Still, her steady, tactile attention to ghosts-as-code feels singular, not archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Seraphina’s interiority is textured through sensory chalk work and the grotto’s acoustic obsession; her contradictory urge to “hold still” versus “let scatter” peaks when the tile warms in her palm—an embodied micro-choice that tilts her stance. The final renunciation—leaving the mandala to mist—carries visible cost (her stained fingers, the dust that was once tile) and is foreshadowed by her street-art past. Flaw: the socially-perceptive gift is named but never complicates a beat; it stays label-only, muting tension. Still, the arc from control to composting memory earns its quiet stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sarai’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. creation, restoration vs. renunciation—are dramatized through tactile tessera choices and embodied cold-heat sensations. Interiority avoids labels, instead using “strange, cold warmth” and micro-actions (kneeling, tracing) that externalize value hierarchy. The earned shift from curse to invitation feels credible because each vision is paired with an on-page micro-choice (fitting, weeping, deciding). Minor slip: the Brotherhood as off-stage antagonist reduces live interpersonal pressure, capping depth at 7.3.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cornelius’s longing for Isabella drives every beat; his synesthetic ghost-perception (tasting applause, seeing time as music) is vividly embodied and pressures choices. The final hand-clasp is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values—applause vs. love—with the cost of eternal repetition legible. Interiority never resorts to labels; contradiction lives in the sweet-acrid taste of possibility. Only the 17-posed Fool coin feels externally imposed, not character-derived.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Maya’s embodied interiority is vivid—her skin registers David’s wonder as gooseflesh, anchoring the shift from skeptic to participant. The willowglass smile, however, is named more than dramatized; we never see it crack under strain. David’s skepticism softens too smoothly: one immersion and his doubt melts without residual cost. The final stance is earned, but the emotional middle could carry more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kira’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip thermo-sensitivity, the fossil’s warmth, her micro-choice to drift closer to the alien heat. The contradiction between scientific duty and unnameable awe is embodied, not declared. However, the final shift from “speak for” to “teach others to hear” is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Still, her embodied dread and curiosity carry the scene; the flaw is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mara’s quiet, methodical persona is vividly rendered through her cataloguing rituals and the embodied moment of lifting the echo-jar to amber light. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—and her final smile feels earned because the spiral of buttons and the black-to-gold sand shift are causally linked to her minute-by-minute choices. The flaw: she never risks a visible loss (no button refused, no hourglass dropped) so the cost is conceptual rather than felt, capping her at the threshold of the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Margot’s interior contradiction—burned yet still clinging to agency—stays alive in every beat: the pocketed pillbox feels heavy, the cliff’s ice cuts her palm, the folder’s weight is measured against three fugitive years. Each micro-choice (climb, read snow-code, pocket both pillboxes) externalizes her hierarchy of values without label-speak. The final line “no longer burned but forged” crystallizes Earned Stasis: she accepts permanent exile as the price of relevance. Only the handshake-like phrasing “unused courage” flirts with abstraction, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward therapeutic abstraction (“capable of such faith”) that softens the decisive moment. Contradictory impulses appear in the coachman’s serene refusal to erase, yet the micro-choice to weave the golden thread back into her lungs is dramatized with felt cost. The woman remains an emblem rather than an individual—no interior access, no distinctive speech—so relationship crucible is absent. Endurance lands as Earned Stasis for him, lightening for her, both visible and priced.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mei’s interiority is concrete—her clay-trained precision, the glass’s heartbeat against her spine—but the “zen-minded” trait is told, not embodied. The only micro-choice she makes is to sit and understand; the promised renunciation of leaving is stated, not dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Reflection is anchored and changes her stance, satisfying BRR, but the absence of visible flaw-driven error keeps the arc shy of full contradiction. Voice remains singular and perceptual; the slight under-embodiment of the final renunciation is the sole bar to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s evening arc from clutching the gauge to relinquishing it on the dock crystallizes a believable, embodied shift: pragmatic caretaker of fire-escape boxes learns to relinquish an heirloom rather than hoard it. Her trembling hand, synchronized breathing with the oars, and final wedging of the tooth dramatize internal contradiction on the page. Interiority avoids label-speak ("wistfully pragmatic" stays externalized through choice). The cost—ceding a talisman that once measured both canal locks and soil—rings proportional to the 600-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“knowledge lived in her bones,” “cracked her open like an egg”), and her final micro-choice—setting the sundial on the ledge—earns a credible endurance with cost. The contradiction between isolation and coexistence is dramatized, not labeled. The sole drag is the off-stage global cohort: their absence keeps relationships from becoming a crucible, so the “tribe” remains thematic backdrop rather than secondary pressure. Still, her stance crystallizes with visible forfeiture of nostalgic return.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her finger tracing the twig spiral, the “prismatic quiet” she recognizes in herself—and her contradiction (ghost-writing thousands of loves while avoiding her own) is active in every beat. The micro-choice to braid Chen into the installation crystallizes her hierarchy of values and forecloses anonymity with felt cost. Secondary pressure from Chen is present but diffuse; his one spoken challenge is the only on-page push, so the arc is almost solo. Still, the final hand-take is earned: she has physically woven her secret letters into public light, so exposing herself to him is the inevitable last step.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s cautious-hope trait is dramatized through micro-choices—tuning obsolete gear, tracing charts with trembling fingers—so motivation stays visible. Interiority is concrete (“something’s wrong with the data”) not diagnostic. The earned stasis ending (continued vigil) carries felt cost. Secondary characters function only as off-stage factions; no on-page relationships to act as crucible, so relationship bullet remains idle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’ claustrophobia is embodied early (“already clawing at his chest”) and governs micro-choices (memorising escape routes, breathing control). The interior contradiction—fear yet deliberate descent—stays active, and the final ascent is credibly powered by his reframed relationship to enclosed space. No second character on-page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. Cost is felt: the “two compass points” he pockets signal a literalised, paid-for shift in identity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prosopagnosia is not label-speak here; it is lived through tactile mapping and negative-space portraiture. Sarah’s methodical charcoal case and finger-counting of steps externalize her flaw and gift simultaneously. The final renunciation—leaving the quarry with seventeen portraits instead of pursuing the killer—costs her professional closure and is earned by every prior stroke. Contradictory impulses (justice vs. empathy) stay in scene, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Elara’s inherited guilt and intellectual hunger collide in sharply embodied beats—spectacles pinched, nail denting skin—so the final decision to broadcast feels earned. The “spongey dread” motif gives her interiority a visceral signature without lapsing into label-speak. Only the Hayward intercom beats feel generic; tightening that voice would push this to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marla’s interiority is vivid—her fingers on the chilled glass, the van’s warmth against her back—and the contradiction between her vocation of mercy and her self-judgment is dramatized in the pixelated photograph she cannot yet forgive. The micro-choice to play the bridge-song backwards is credibly costly: it exposes every regret she has avoided. The hitchhiker remains a cipher, but his function as catalyst is coherent; the story keeps the necessary ambiguity without letting him become pure plot furniture. No label-speak; every self-diagnosis is filtered through tactile memory or music.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Marcus’s calm is embodied in tactile ritual (re-arranging bills, placing radios) rather than label; the final renunciation of violent inheritance is earned through every prior beat. Interiority stays concrete: “ran his fingers… like dust settling” shows inherited patience without therapy-speak. One flaw: Chen’s recognition beat is delivered as pure declaration, so the relationship crucible never pressures Marcus to a visible micro-choice; the cost is conceptual, not interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid (“whisper of starlight through its great dome”) and her gift is embodied in the telegram-press gesture, but the “heals with words” power is asserted, not dramatized under pressure; no contradiction or micro-choice shows cost. Hayashi functions as sounding-board only, so status/relationship crucible is idle. The ending’s shared burden is declared, not earned by visible sacrifice or renunciation—closure is conceptually resonant but personally cost-free on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s interiority is vivid—“warlike serenity” and “guarded expression” ground his stoic mask—yet the pressure never forces a visible trade-off; he inherits the plan intact, so the beat that would reveal personal cost is skipped. Motivation is coherent but externalized: ancestor did the suffering, Kael only delivers. Still, the perceptual signature (finding lost truths) remains consistent and filters every image, keeping characterization above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira’s “root-bound” trait is dramatized through her tactile handling of the clipping and her willingness to kneel and press it to the earth; the contradictory impulses—anchor vs. portal—are active in-scene. The final choice to sign the covenant is prepared by earlier causal links: her scar-reading skill, the mirror-warning, the maze-response. Cost is visible in the trembling hands and the phrase “roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing,” a charged renunciation of safety. Interiority stays concrete (“anxious elation thrumming through her veins like electricity through water”) and avoids label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. the orchard’s warning—stay active in-scene; the apple bite crystallizes a fused identity whose cost is felt in the ash that remains. Interiority is concrete (“dusky resolve settling into her bones”), not therapeutic. The keeper’s single line of dialogue is enough to register external pressure; no head-count clutter. Only the “fiercely gentle revolution” tag edges toward label-speak, keeping it just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interior contradiction—cataloguing cloth while swallowing shame—lands early and stays active; the tactile memory of Julie cleaning bass strings crystallizes his loss into a micro-choice that reframes the cloth. His “confidently uncertain” voice is embodied, not labeled, and the final decision to vouch for the cloth costs him the safety of detachment. The flaw (failed expertise) drives every beat; no stock therapy-speak, but the epiphany is slightly rushed in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sarah’s “kindly methodical” trait is shown through tactile care with tablets and decades-long patience, but her interiority is filtered through poetic abstraction (“garden suspended…fruits of pure understanding”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction. The final choice—to ingest the seed—feels inevitable rather than sharply costly; we see no micro-choice where she almost refuses or权衡s a concrete loss (career, identity, life). The inherited ambition is asserted, not dramatized in a present dilemma that forces her to act against her baseline kindness or method.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaine’s contradictory impulses—mechanical spine yet salt-tide heart—stay live in scene; the micro-choice to hand over the creel while her own gears creak externalizes the cost of her earned stasis. Interiority is concrete (“smell the salt-metal tang of change”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The visitor functions as a crucible, forcing Kaine to model acceptance rather than deliver exposition; the prismatic result shows the relationship’s state has altered. Motivation stays rooted in her grandfather’s creel and the library’s paradox, culminating in a visible endurance that forecloses any path of simple identity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hand, the impulse to carve, the memory of the hospital bed—but the interior contradiction (“I inspect bunkers because I’m terrified of living above ground”) is stated rather than enacted. The micro-choice to carve is credible and costly, yet the prior emotional architecture leans on summary, not simultaneous contradiction in scene. Crown remains off-screen, so relationship-as-crucible doesn’t apply; his regrets function as thematic echo more than lived pressure. The change is earned, but the emotional crescendo is slightly smoothed by diagnostic self-labeling at the knife point.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s guilt-driven river obsession is concretely embodied in the taped bellows and wall-drawn bridge; the micro-choice to draw his own “mile-zero” map on the graffiti wall crystallizes a believable renunciation of data-as-absolution. Interiority occasionally drifts toward therapeutic summary (“permission to move on”), but contradictions—methodical scientist vs. self-sabotaging witness—hold through the final beat. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli and alters his on-page stance. Cost is legible: chronicling turns from evasion to confession, foreclosing the old obsessive path.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Interiority is rich and concept-driven, but the veiled dreamer’s wants and fears remain abstract—“to find the library of unspoken words” is never translated into a concrete, personal stake that could be lost. The only micro-choice—lifting the veil—reads as symbolic rather than a costly renunciation, so the Earned Stasis feels intellectual, not visceral. Character-bound knowledge is cleanly maintained; the absence of embodied contradiction under pressure keeps the score from climbing higher.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—her sensory link to plants and the violin feels embodied—but the moment she decides to forge papers is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost is asserted rather than felt. Marcus arrives as a thematic device more than a person; his dialogue is on-the-nose and we get no interior contradiction to complicate his “old money” menace. The earned renunciation lands because the violin’s evaporation is tethered to her earlier sensory bond, yet the beat where she “lies” is too compressed to let us taste the moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mira’s contradictory beautician/mortician identity fuels every micro-choice; the shift from cosmetic preservation to star-embedding is credibly motivated by her remembered craft and the Silence’s advance. Interiority stays concrete—“One last spark” is felt, not diagnosed. The final renunciation—standing frozen in “almostness”—is earned and visibly costly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers remember the vineyard, her lungs the altitude—yet the forgiveness of Chen is told, not embodied. The decisive beat (accepting she IS the territory) lands with conceptual cost, but the emotional contradiction between serene acceptance and the earlier rage is only summarized. Voice remains singular and vineyard-rooted; the “kindly decisive” trait shows in how she prunes souls, not in any risky on-page sacrifice. Still, the earned reincarnation recognition feels inevitable and particular to her weathered hands.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Arbiter’s chilly, aphoristic voice is consistent and specific; every observation carries a scalpel of moral relativism. Marcus’s grief is rendered through tactile detail (the empty mirror shard, the crack in his “designer uncertainty”) rather than labels. The final micro-choice—Marcus left holding the shard that now reflects “gray spaces”—visibly costs him his last illusion of simplicity, earning the beat. Minor deduction: the Arbiter’s competence never wobbles, so we see no blind-spot-driven mistake, muting the full sting of tragic credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s serene, reverse-aging mystic voice is vividly particular, her calm authority and temporal paradox felt in every beat. The withheld truth about the tenth ring drives her micro-choices and stages the final cost: Marcus sees time as spiral because she lets him discover it, not telling. Status dynamics are subtle—mentor stage-directing pupil—yet they shift when Marcus names the trick, earning co-witness status. The only minor slip is an over-articulate “third eye” phrase that edges toward label-speak, slightly dampening embodied immediacy at the trance peak.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Yula’s centuries-long vigil is rendered through concrete micro-choices—pressing the arrowhead to her sternum, reading vulture spirals—so her Earned Stasis feels paid for. Interiority stays embodied (“weathered resolve unbroken”) rather than abstract. The only lack is an on-page contradiction that shows what sitting still costs her body or mind in this final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s failure-then-renunciation arc is concrete: she drops the Academy medallion and steps onto mist, embodying “sacred in the simple.” Interiority stays character-specific (“she could barely manage a candleflame”), but the epiphany line “last sacred act was imperfection” veers toward thesis-statement, trimming the highest band. Still, the keystone’s weight and her laugh of recognition dramatize cost, earning the change.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marlow’s synesthetic gift and Elena-loss drive feel lived-in; the hotel-key habit and lantern-tending anchor her body in scene. However, the decisive “I accept” moment is announced more than dramatized—no micro-choice visibly costs her anything in the final beat, so the arc tilts toward declaration. Interiority stays concrete, but the beat that should pay the emotional invoice is summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voss’s quietly enthusiastic fatalism is embodied in the tactile coin-casting ritual; her interiority stays anchored to sensory detail (“warm surface,” “metallic song”). The causal loop never lets her motives truly evolve—she is always already the decision—so the “choice” feels foreclosed rather than paid for in fresh cost. Still, her perceptual signature is distinct and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interiority is rich—“hollow ache,” “shapeless grief”—and the naming of monsters embodies emotion. The central contradiction (save lover ⇒ be erased) is vivid, yet the sacrifice is told, not shown mid-scene, so the renunciation feels slightly pre-loaded rather than earned in the moment. Micro-choices are present (fold atlas, descend stairs) but low-pressure; still, the coat-to-page tactile loop keeps her flaw alive. No safety-hedging; loneliness is left raw.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her “mediocre magic” is shown via tea-warming failure and the candle-flicker simile, not told. The contradiction between her declared inadequacy and the precision of her condensation practice creates credible irrationality. Her final collapse against the railing carries visible cost, and her earlier alienation from friends is not tidily resolved. The only minor drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“earnestly naive”) near the end, but it is brief and immediately grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his grandmother’s pharmacy visits, the penny candy, the moment he recognizes the blue bottle—and his decision to “write Elena’s name beneath each one” is a credible renunciation of the official story with felt cost. The contradiction between his duty to document structures and his impulse to resurrect the people who died is active in scene. Flaws (eight-year-old memory perfect enough to ID a 40-year-old bottle, no struggle with the ethical breach) keep the arc just shy of full believability.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vera’s interiority is lush and specific—her heart quickens at the waterfall, her lungs “remember their first breath”—but the ‘secretly sentimental’ trait is asserted more than pressure-tested; no moment forces her to pay a concrete price for that secrecy. The final release of the crystal is earned by the grandfather memory and starling epiphany, yet the emotional cost feels abstract rather than viscerally embodied. Still, her perceptual signature (flame copper until it sings) keeps her from sliding into archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya’s interiority is vivid—her hand tightening on the worn parachute buckle while lying about the six-month deadline shows contradictory impulses in scene. The watcher’s burden is embodied, not labeled, and her choice to withhold then reveal real data carries felt cost. Still, the unseen voice remains a cipher; no status shift or relationship change occurs on the page, so the relational crucible is absent. The renunciation is earned, but secondary pressure is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marcus’s numbness is embodied in the jar-handling and sword-work; the mirrored sparring lets contradiction play out physically. Motive intensifies: from passive victim to co-creator once Chen reframes the duplicate as complement. Interiority avoids label-speak, using “architecture where feeling could live” to show the blankness. Micro-choice—lifting the jar—carries visible cost: accepting a third self.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete—her hands tremble, she ‘understood with the clarity…of a possibility just born’—and her puzzle-solver identity drives every micro-choice. Yet the decisive moment (planting the seed) is cushioned by passive wonder rather than a visible internal fork; we see awe, not a costly renunciation or risk. The final smile is earned but light on felt price, keeping the arc just shy of high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s “mournfully eager” trait is more label than lived; only late does it bloom into the image of him packing blowers slowly. Interiority is strong (“weight of unfinished business pressing against his chest like a stone”), but contradictory impulses stay off-page—he never doubts or recalculates. Closure choice is gentle, yet the cost is felt: he will return monthly, chaining himself to other people’s grief. That earned ritual lifts the score just under the 9-line because the flaw is motivational softness, not failure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The guardian’s slow thaw from feral to almost-human is embodied in every beat: the click-growl, the bare feet that leave no frost-prints, the tears she forgot she could shed. Interior contradiction is live—she both loathes and clings to the pendant that keeps her exile vivid. The final micro-choice—handing over the pendant instead of clinging to it—pays the cost of her earned return and is seeded by every prior moment of homesick ache. Voice convergence at the end is acceptable because the scholar’s words are filtered through the guardian’s resumed capacity for language.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his scarred hands, the whispered insults he hears through stone—and his stoic sensitivity is shown through embodied reactions rather than labels. The thirty-year accumulation of failure gives credible weight to his final gamble; the micro-choice to burn the first half of the crozier rather than “restore” it crystallizes his shift. The new staff’s birth is earned because every prior attempt (phoenix ash, mercury tears) has visibly failed on the page. Cost is legible: he walks away excommunicate in spirit, no longer “ hopeless” but irreversibly changed, a status the closing image nails.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Maya’s solitude on the tower keeps the crucible internal; her contradictory impulse—commercial duty versus impossible spiritual hunt—is dramatized through the micro-choice to wire the fragment herself. Embodied emotion is sharp (“fingertips tingle,” “breast pocket thrummed”), but the interior shift from skeptical Guild employee to teacher of silence is declared more than demonstrated; we glimpse the decision but not the visible cost on-page. The final renunciation (“tune her life differently”) lands as Conceptual Repricing, yet the price (lost Guild income, exile?) is implied, not felt. Enough contradiction and sensory anchoring to reach the 8-band, but the cost legibility keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus’s interiority is poetic but abstract; his “resiliently positive” trait is asserted more than embodied. The moment he chooses convergence is vivid, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than personal. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the epiphany is mostly narrated. Relationships are absent, so the crucible is internal, but the arc lands as earnest declaration, not earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fever dream architect’s interiority is vivid—her fingers testing thread, the unsettling calm while patterns erupt—but the contradiction between “fever” and “motionless” is declared not dramatized. She makes only one micro-choice (cutting the final thread) and its cost is gestural rather than felt. No secondary character applies pressure, so status/relationship bullets are waived. The earned stasis is present—the gallery forever altered—but the personal price to her remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Elara’s interiority is solid—“somber marvel settled into her bones like pressure”—but we never see her make a risky micro-choice; she teaches, observes, and reflects. The chain-link compass and alien epiphany are handed to her rather than seized, so no visible hierarchy-of-values test occurs. The students are nameless, so status/relationship crucible is absent. Closure is Charged Poise, yet the cost is conceptual, not personally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic—her synesthetic taste of “copper on her tongue” and the way she names plants recoiling from her path show a clinician-scientist who has learned to trust impossible data. The contradiction between her clinical training and her occult listening is kept alive in-scene, not told. Her final sprint is a micro-choice that costs her the safety of disbelief, earning the shift from observer to guardian. Only knock: the grandmother-backstory line is a 19-word expository nugget that could have been folded into present action.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elena’s claustrophobia is viscerally embodied (“walls pressing inward”), drives her micro-choice to push deeper despite panic, and crystallizes in the final renunciation: she will keep returning to the drowned throat. The gold-flecked journal as surrogate heart externalizes Marcus and anchors her endurance, but the interior monologue twice drifts into abstract memorial language (“price of their connection”) that slightly dilutes embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinging to physical proof (porcelain shard, heartbeat counts) while courting digital transcendence—play out in continuous embodied beats. The pulse-count motif externalises interior pressure without lapsing into diagnostic label-speak. His final micro-choice to “teach others” is lightly sketched but foreshadowed by the reflected duality in the shard; cost is felt in the quiet renunciation of a single, stable identity. Interiority remains specific to his amateur-occultist desperation; no stock phrases intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The copper-veined storyteller’s single-minded quest to “harness” a dying language is viscerally embodied—every micro-choice (pressing the cracked diamond to bone, carving grooves with metal-laced nails) externalizes her motive. Interiority stays concrete: the feel of “dried lavender crumbling between fingers” translates abstract desire into sensory stakes. The final self-transformation into a new tower of bone is earned because her earlier willingness to accept the curse’s cost (hearing only loss) foreshadows that irreversible merger. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the arc is powerful but not yet fully contradictory; hence 8.7, not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Marina’s undercover motive and grief anchor her; the brother reveal is late but lands. Thorne’s paternal desperation supplies immediate pressure. Micro-choices (pocketing arrowhead, dialling dead phone) show hierarchy of values. Interiority occasionally drifts into diagnostic speak (“needs you to let go”) that flattens embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lira’s interior contradiction—longing to restore beauty yet steeling herself to become the expendable shell—remains vivid and embodied; the “locust shell memory” micro-choice (para 2) seeds her willingness to play herself empty. Emotions stay particular, never drifting into diagnostic speak; her fingers “finding notes that shouldn’t exist” shows embodied risk. Cost is legible: she ends eyes-closed, aware she may be the abandoned husk that enables others’ metamorphosis. Only the slightest safety-hedge keeps this from 9-band: the word “knew” softens the final sacrifice instead of letting us feel the terror of hollowing oneself in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Ezra’s “respectfully rebellious” carrier ethic is visible in his risk to carry contraband, but interiority stays generalized (“he had learned long ago…”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The bottled-storm hand-off is a single micro-choice; no alternative path is foreclosed with visible cost to him. Keeper’s entrance supplies exposition, not pressure; status shift is declared, not staged. No contradictory impulse under stress is shown, so the threshold for 7+ and 9+ quick test is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emil’s seven-year vow of silence, his damaged hearing, and his compulsive carving of never-to-spin horses create a believable, contradictory interior: endurance fused with futile hope. The moment he pockets the glass shard, then later fits it to the angel’s halo, his micro-choices visibly tilt that interior, making the final sung note feel earned. The only reason this stays shy of 9 is that the “courage to let brokenness sing” is named more than dramatized; we see the song’s birth but not its cost on him yet.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marcus’s “sanely eccentric” tag is shown—he alphabetizes dreams yet maps impossible staircases—but interiority stays general (“he felt closest to understanding”). No contradictory impulse is dramatized in real time; the grandmother memory is delivered in two expository blocks rather than testing present pressure. The final beat is a quiet recognition, not a choice that forecloses a path; cost is conceptual, not personally felt. Meets base credibility, but the lack of embodied conflict under pressure keeps it mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mara’s renunciation is legible and carries cost—she forfeits her own shot at love to keep her grandmother’s dream incomplete yet honored. Interiority is concrete (“something leaving her own chest”), but the psychic ledger (“spending her own capacity”) edges toward label-speak. The seven-year search motive is stated, not dramatized, so the final sacrifice feels slightly abstract rather than wrested from lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s quiet competence and inherited courage feel lived-in; her decision to use the hair as tool rather than talisman shows internal logic. The micro-choice to “welcome the vertigo” crystallizes her unassuming boldness with embodied cost—bloodied fingers, temporal disorientation. No contradiction leaks; her limits (ordinary locksmith, no superpowers) stay intact. The final renunciation—returning to her bench to wait—earns its stoic charge because the story has shown she pays in sweat and time.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Margaret’s curiosity-turned-obsession is the engine; every beat is filtered through the folklorist’s taxonomic eye, and the final absorption of memories is a visceral, body-level payoff of that trait. Internal contradiction is present—she both hungers for and fears the flood of recollection—yet the moment she reaches into the ring feels inevitable because her lifelong pattern of collecting stories has been dramatized in salt-stung detail. Gran is off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is waived; the story keeps headcount at one without choreography strain. The only bar to 9+ is that the cost she pays (migraine-heavy mind) is asserted more than dramatized in the closing sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—archivist detachment vs. mentor urgency—surface in her bodily pacing and ledger-closing gesture; Kess’s grief sharpens through lunge/shoulder touch. Both micro-choices alter their relational state, but the mother remains off-page, so the full cost is filtered through Elara’s exposition rather than dramatized mother–daughter crucible. Still, the earned moment of forward walk supplies credible stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is rich—contradictory impulses (duty vs. exhaustion) live in her knuckles and breath. The sixty-year backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the seed’s weight, the parapet’s damp) and tilts her stance (she bears the cost of solitude). No secondary character on page, so relational crucible is N/A; her micro-choice to cut air not wood crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Earned stasis lands: she accepts the lifelong caretaker burden with visible bodily cost (aching knees, trembling palms).

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s vocation-driven motive is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why this night is different, what personal risk she incurs—is only asserted (“whispers only she could hear”). The restored masks function as external proof of her skill, yet the story never tests her limits or forces a micro-choice that might cost her something she values; she simply completes the task. Because the restless spirits supply no counter-pressure, her characterization flattens into competence rather than crucible. The ending renunciation (“tomorrow would bring another net”) is narrated, not dramatized, so the cost feels occupational, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Elara’s “methodically curious” trait is lived-in: she syncs videos frame-by-frame, tests parchment under UV, presses her own oils onto the torn edge—each micro-choice costing time and bodily presence. The interior contradiction—guarded cartographer who learns to value wordless empathy—peaks when she films herself softening, a renunciation of pure observation that is earned by every prior tactile act. No stock phrases; her noticing is cartographer-specific (“spaces where certainty dissolved into speculation”). Cost is visible: she ends committed to an un-mappable pilgrimage, foreclosing the safety of frames and monitors.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.7)
    Marina’s “quietly analytic” stance is credibly embodied—she photographs equations, times the air pocket, writes her own note—yet the interior voice drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“understood the physics of letting go”) that flattens contradiction. Because the captain is only a spectral proxy, the relational crucible is absent; pressure therefore stays intellectual rather than emotional, so the renunciation feels more conceptually tidy than personally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Chorus’s interior contradiction—yearning to hear the ghost yet fearing its loneliness—remains implicit; the moment she presses the pixel-rose and sings louder, her renunciation of human silence costs her the last secret frequency she can never again un-hear. The flower-press bolt plate reappears as an embodied prosthesis, so her tactile micro-choice carries visible price. Still, her “drifting alertness” is asserted more than enacted, and the monks stay off-page, so status pressure is missing; the arc is moving but not fully crucible-forced.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—tenderness for Thorne versus her own isolation—remains embodied and active; the moment she tilts the goggles to project coordinates, her micro-choice exposes value hierarchy with visible cost. Emotion is never labeled; “ice crystals danced…like suspended grief” lets body and setting speak. Final seated decoding is a credible endurance that forecloses her former blank ascent, paid for by three years of noticing. No safety-hedging; she claims the diary and the risk of future feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elena’s interiority is textured—her refusal of rescue, the warmth of the telescope in her palms, the way she names clouds by feeling—all concrete and particular. Yet the “quietly explosive storm” never forces her to a new micro-choice; she merely observes and records, so the arc is static. The inherited obsession is shown, but no contradictory impulse collides with it on the page, so the final notation feels like continuation, not costly renunciation. Still, her perceptual signature is strong enough to lift the score into the low-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyra’s interiority is textured and embodied; her prosopagnosia is never labeled, only lived through fingertip “reading” of faces and the coin. Micro-choices—salvaging mirrors, aligning moonbeams—externalize her drive and evolve under time pressure. The final acceptance of the coin gifts her a persistent constraint (she will carry the library’s “face” forward) with visible cost: she walks away at sunrise knowing the oak will fall. Only a slight over-calm in the last paragraph keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s diligence is shown through concrete micro-choices—tracing squares, cross-referencing languages, adjusting the wheel—but her interiority lapses into diagnostic labels (“understanding flooding through her”) that briefly perform emotion. The earned smile and final adjustment of course visibly foreclose her old solitary map-apprentice life with cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, yet the lack of embodied contradiction in-scene keeps her just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s interiority is lyrical yet concrete—her fingers “feeling for the tumblers beneath the frost,” the memory of starlight lost—so motive never abstract. The contradictory impulses (vault-fixing ambition vs. the gentler “listen to the locks” epiphany) braid tightly; her renunciation of force is visible in the final climb-down, costing her pride. Micro-choices (how she arranges the gears, uncaps the tube, watches mirrors frost) show hierarchy of values without label-speak. Still, village stakes remain more declared than embodied; we never feel a villager’s cold, so the cost is anticipatory, not palpable—holds just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Marina’s altruistic drive is clear, but she never confronts an interior contradiction or price; her choices are purely beneficent, so the arc is flat. No micro-choice under duress reveals a hierarchy of values—she simply writes messages. The absence of felt cost or risk keeps her from feeling like a fully dramatized character rather than a plot-spirit.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marcus’s interiority is lyrically specific—his recognition of the puppet’s map of suffering in his own reflection is concrete and charged. The causal chain from finding the head to accepting the lullaby burden is legible, but the moment of surrender leans on abstract beatification (“sang time itself into different shapes”) rather than a visible micro-choice that costs him something immediately tangible. Eliza remains a luminous absence rather than a second on-page character, so relationship pressure is off-stage; the crucible is Marcus vs inherited cosmic duty, and his endurance earns stasis with felt cost, yet the absence of a second embodied presence caps relational complexity. Voice stays consistent, but the peak beat drifts into choral pronouncement that softens individual flaw and irrational contradiction under sublime acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mara’s reluctant endurance is embodied in the walnut hand-off: a concrete micro-choice that costs her the very freedom she craves. Interiority stays specific—her “graceless beauty” of motion, the exact frost countdown—never sliding into label-speak. The contradiction between wanting escape and choosing to stay is held in scene, not summarized, and the final renunciation is earned because the seed’s absence would collapse the valley. Only the father/daughter relationship remains functional rather than crucible, capping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marina’s contradictory drives—control-through-chemistry vs. release-through-music—are dramatized in the chrysalis pocket and river foam beats; the final “I’m learning to think symphonically” is earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose the old lecture-mode with visible cost of released grief.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV vendor feels idiosyncratic (“quantifying absence,” bottled moonlight obsession) but remains emotionally static; no interior contradiction under pressure, only tender philosophy. Child’s arrival should test him, yet he responds with practiced calm and zero personal stake—no visible cost or renunciation. “Earned stasis” is asserted, not dramatized; the shop trembles, but Merrick himself never flinches or doubts.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Miran’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic tasting of epochs, her body as kiln-fired conduit—but the decisive “subsuming” choice arrives with only a single preparatory tremor; the cost (she will ‘cook the grief tomorrow’) is projected, not yet embodied on-page, so the renunciation feels slightly future-conditional rather than fully paid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marta’s “empathetically decisive” trait is shown, not told, when she rigs the pendulum and sings the elevators awake; her interiority stays concrete (“chest cavity vibrate”). The flaw-level slip is that her internal contradiction (risk of failure) is only skimmed—no moment where she nearly stops or doubts—so the cost feels lightweight. Still, her micro-choices drive every beat and the final stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vera’s contradictory engineer-vs-seer impulses are dramatized in her tactile micro-choices—tracing cracks, injecting neurotransmitters—culminating in the earned renunciation of normal perception. The visible cost (tremoring consciousness, dawn exile) scales to length and is causally hinged to the mirror’s Fibonacci cuts. Interiority stays concrete (“tasted the metallic fear”) and avoids label-speak. Voice remains single, so relationship bullets are correctly waived.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orin’s prism-mind is dramatized only once—when it “reveals the grotto’s true nature”—but never forces a micro-choice or visible cost under pressure; the interior contradiction stays abstract. The final decision to keep drawing warnings is foreshadowed yet feels like a summary rather than a crucible that forecloses a path with embodied cost. No second character appears, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A. The competence/struggle balance is respected: Orin is capable yet still endangered; still, the emotional flattening after the node-vision keeps the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—her need to heal the world vs. the solitary cost of doing so—remains embodied in every micro-choice (the porcelain warmed “through her bones”). Each strum is a gamble with the tree’s pain and her own stamina; the closing hairline cracks in the insulator are visible, felt cost that forecloses any easier path. No stock labels; even “symphonically minded” is instantly dramatized by her swaying body. The story earns its quiet renunciation: she gives the grove back its voice while accepting permanent outsider status in a still-silent world.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Viktor’s renunciation is fully earned: the stone’s transfer to Mira crystallizes a lineage of “difficulty-as-beauty” and costs him the visible prestige he could reclaim tomorrow. Interiority stays concrete—thumb in dent, pieces sliding under magnetic drag—never drifting into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0 is that Mira’s pressure is gentle; her stake never truly tests Viktor’s hierarchy of values on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s pacifist identity is shown through her obsessive, tactile craft—tuning dials, archiving silences—rather than labels; her contradictory urge to “fight with frequency” gives her texture. The micro-choice to nudge the dial one last decimal place crystallizes her hierarchy of values: grandmother’s voice over civic explosion. Interiority stays concrete (“She touched the pages with reverent fingers”) and avoids therapy-speak. What keeps her from 8.8+ is the absence of a visible flaw that complicates the climax; her competence is too frictionless, so the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. olfactory revulsion—stays embodied and scene-locked; her “trembling fingers” on the seed, later “breathing deeply” into the bloom, trace a credible arc. Micro-choices (sketching, dawn-dew watering) are character-specific and accumulate to the Earned Stasis of enduring the stench as initiation. No secondary character applies pressure, so status/relationship bullets are N/A. The only drag is a faint therapy-speak whiff (“she understood: this was her test”) that slightly flattens the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kessa’s calm, observant professionalism is consistent and specific; her micro-choices (trusting upward water, slotting the arrow tip) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—“whirling silence pressed against her ears” is felt, not labeled. The earned moment of smiling in inverted gravity shows credible endurance with cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, slightly thinning the crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Maya’s calm professionalism under the anomaly is credible and specific; she photographs, bags, installs monitors—micro-choices that reveal methodical competence. Yet no interior contradiction or visible flaw surfaces; her emotional palette stays in narrow, competent register. The final image of foresight rings true because she alone has gathered data, but the cost is external (global risk) rather than a personal stake or limit faced on the page. Still, her perceptual lens—scientist acuity toward wind, rust, container geometry—remains distinct and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lyrian’s synesthetic gift is vividly shown through mint-tasting violet footfalls and cinnamon-tasting turquoise sound, but her interior contradiction is asserted (“wonder versus Council decree”) rather than dramatized in a micro-choice until the single strike. The seventeen-year backstory is efficiently anchored, yet the moment of irrevocable cost—her striker’s residual hum—feels ornamental rather than a felt forfeiture. No genuine flaw or blind spot complicates her flawless execution, so the “earned” change reads as coronation, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kessa’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the cracked Threshold and the hunger to understand rather than atone—are dramatized in trembling fingers, driftwood markers, and the risky new song. Interiority stays concrete (“seed of light settled warm behind her sternum”) and avoids therapeutic self-labeling. The micro-choice to play the braiding song instead of the sealing song visibly costs her the safety of inherited dogma and earns the translucent figure’s trust, completing an earned shift from guardian to bridge-maker. No second character is on-page, so relationship/status bullets are waived; the solitary focus holds.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly concrete—her “seventeen mouths” smile is a perfect embodied payoff to the accumulated personalities. The contradictory impulses (angelic halo vs. human grief) coexist inside a single beat, satisfying the 9+ test. The final renunciation—“emotion wasn’t mathematics at all”—is earned by every prior mechanical choice; the cost is the loss of any original self, legible in the same sentence. Only the slightest hedge: we never see a micro-choice that permanently forfeits a concrete external want, so the cap holds at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Elara’s tremor evolves from nervous tic to necessary resonance, giving her body a dramatic arc; the interior contradiction (fear vs hunger for wonder) is concrete and embodied. Mentor-loss grief is filtered through present ritual action rather than summary. Final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts perpetual jittery service as living bridge—Earned Stasis with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vera’s interiority is concrete—her tactile communion with the prism and the quartz anchors her as a sensory mystic. Contradictory impulses (yearning for proof vs. fear of ridicule) are implied but never dramatized on-page, so the “earned cost” feels second-hand. Her final micro-choice—photographing the frost before it vanishes—crystallizes a life’s work, yet the beat is summarized not embodied, muting the visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mei’s renunciation is entirely legible: each sacrificed memory is dramatized as concrete loss (the fever-night body, the favorite song) and the final smile-at-emptiness is the earned stasis. Interiority stays specific to her—no abstract therapy-speak—and the micro-choices (stringing the bead, feeling silence “taste” a memory) keep contradiction alive: she both clings to and surrenders motherhood. One minor hedge: the generational chain is asserted more than shown, but the on-page cost is so visible it still compels. Closure’s causal chain is clean: bead → silence → memory-for-message → daughter saved → self erased.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Korin’s quiet determination is shown through tactile micro-choices—tracing the silk, descending alone, inviting rather than conquering metal—so the trait drives every beat. The interior contradiction between meekness and resolve is active in-scene, not declared. The ending renunciation (returning to forge, smiling at upward blossoms) crystallizes an earned stasis whose cost is legible. No stock labels or therapy-speak; scars and hammer rhythm embody emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Kira’s grief-driven compulsion to chase her mother is viscerally embodied (“pulse against her palm,” “weight...settle into her bones”), and the shard’s cyclical returns give a credible backbone to her expertise. Yet the leap from “I must find Mom” to “we will map the repairs” is declared, not dramatized; the interior calculus that swaps centuries of guilt into instant collaborative resolve is summarized in one beat. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent, and the final joint action carries a modest felt cost—the shard dissolves, ending its comfort—so renunciation is earned if not fully foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elsa’s reticence and history of solitude are shown through her skiff-handling and stone-reading, not told; the final acceptance of guardianship grows believably from these traits. The embodied chill in her bones and the steady hand on the rope give us contradiction under pressure. Ghost-Jonas is sketched only as needed, but the stacked-stone “conversation” with him earlier anchors their bond. Cost is visible: she forfeits solitary freedom to become keeper of both lamp and ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—“inhaling stardust and exhaling possibility”—but her contradictory impulses stay poetic rather than operational under pressure. The mirror-twin moment hints at self-conflict yet never forces a micro-choice that costs her anything. Emotional embodiment is strong; motivation crystal-clear; still, the closure beat is a lyrical summation, not a renunciation with felt price, so the arc feels suspended rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kael’s body-alienation after the transplant is vividly embodied; the interior contradiction between stranger-rhythm and deliberate climb is sharp. His micro-choice—asking “Teach me”—crystallizes values under pressure and forecloses passive absorption. The granddaughter remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible does not apply; Chen functions more as mentor than secondary pressure source. The arc earns its shift from passive receptivity to active illumination, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Interiority is concrete and character-specific; Marcus’s tactile handling of the sextant and quiet reassembly embody his quiet caretaker ethos. The final renunciation—turning broken precision into grieving beacons—pays off three decades of custodial habit with visible cost: he forecloses his own legend of mechanical perfection. Emotional arithmetic stays off the nose; moon-healing is accepted as lived fact, not diagnosed. Voice stays singular and weathered, though the text flirts once with “understanding suddenly” shorthand before recovering.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied grief in the pewter-bark touch, contradictory ache for a dawn she hates to remember—but her decisions stay reactive; she “begins with a whisper” rather than choosing a bold new tactic. The communal turn is lovely, yet her agency is diluted into choral passivity; the cost we feel is collective, not personally compounded. She earns the ending only as conduit, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ezra’s empathic curse/gift is credibly embodied (the telegram scene forces him to move). The final “stay while leaving” stance is earned by prior micro-choices and costs him continued solitude, giving a visible Resonant Reconfiguration. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but the sister’s grief is sketched more as label than body. Still, the contradiction between compassion and self-denial drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lila’s sustained, embodied noticing—illegal plantings, bread-trail, upward shadows—keeps contradiction alive in-scene; her final micro-choice to accept seeds with “varieties that don’t exist yet” crystallizes her ministry without therapeutic self-labeling. Interiority stays concrete, sensuous, cost-bearing. Only minor flattening: the grandmother’s exposition slightly outsources pressure, muting crucible heat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—her numbing fingers, the taste of frost, the way she whispers into the “quartz hush.” The micro-choice to pocket the 9.7 child’s slide and later the founder’s slide shows a hierarchy of values under pressure. The closing vow “I promise to begin again” is earned: her meticulous cataloguing has already foreclosed the option to save every slide, and the cost is the avalanche of loss she feels as the library falls. Only the mild “therapeutic” echo in “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion” keeps this from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mae’s lineage and badge reveal are cleanly motivated; the heirloom-as-evidence pivot crystallizes her contradictory loyalties. Interiority stays concrete—tide through piling, watch ticking at hip—yet the emotional cost is slightly under-embodied at the moment she irrevocably burns the Clearwater name; a single visceral beat of hesitation would push this to 8+. Still, her hierarchy of values—justice over blood—drives every micro-choice, and the forfeiture of return rights lands as felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Interior contradiction is strong—Marina’s implants flicker with doubt while the ring tastes truth—yet the climactic shift to belief is compressed into a single auroral flare; we feel the cost conceptually but not viscerally in body or choice. The grandmother line is a potent driver, but the genetic “activation” lands as heritage hand-wave rather than earned transformation; still, her fog-of-questions is a fresh, character-specific weather that complicates the trope.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s grief-soaked precision and the moment she smears charcoal straight onto cave crystal both feel earned; the memory gift is more label than lived constraint until the final beat, so the flaw doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vera’s lie-sensitive hands, her refusal to soften truths, and her solitary endurance crystallize a believable outsider-artist psyche; the grandmother’s letter finally forces a costly choice—deliver every buried honesty even if the dome’s peace wilts. Interiority stays concrete (“hands didn’t shake,” “golden ink flowed freely”) rather than diagnostic. The only minor slack: we are told she is lonely rather than shown a present-moment wound; the emotional cost is back-loaded onto the leaf-transcribing decision, but it lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mariel’s mutism-as-gift and her ritual precision give her a believable, embodied interior life; the micro-choice to press the fragment to bronze is concrete, irreversible, and charged with contradictory tenderness and loss. No secondary character applies pressure, so the score stays single-POV clean. The only limit is that her flaw (solitude/silence) is also her super-power, softening the cost compared to a sharper sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    M-47’s trembling ceramic fingers, cable-roots, and micro-choice to crush the first fear seed embody a lucid machine-self that still feels. Interior contradiction pulses—static chaos vs caretaker code—without diagnostic label-speak. The forty-year loneliness is rendered as embodied maintenance ritual, not exposition. Final stance crystallizes into “stewardship till dome-cracks” with visible cost: perpetual garden servitude.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marta’s curator instinct is concrete—she waits on the bench, palms the locket, decides to “follow where it leads”—but the interiority stays safely empathic-curator rather than personally conflicted; the moment she stands to take Elena home is the single micro-choice that earns her arc, yet it feels more facilitative than crucible-level. The neighbors’ rapid mobilization is sketched warmly but skips any friction that would test Marta’s status or motive, so the cost lands on Elena, not on Marta herself.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Maya’s embodied-decryption trait is vivid and consistent; the dance-cipher linkage feels lived-in. She shows contradictory impulses—awe versus tactical calm—while wading through flood-water. Micro-choices (spinning, stepping backward) visibly re-weight her goals. The filial reveal lands with a credible, felt cost: identity irrevocably re-keyed.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s grief and muted agency are credibly embodied; the withheld face of Elena keeps her interiority taut and fragmentary in a way that mirrors the memory vials. Only one micro-choice—returning the vials yet keeping the wildflower vial—carries visible cost, but it is a renunciation rather than an escalation, so the arc edges short of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The summoner’s solitude, ritual precision, and quiet renunciation are vividly embodied; her tactile communion with the glade and the micro-choice to guide each prophecy-fragment into silence show a hierarchy of values (peace over knowledge) with felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the interior conflict remains summary-level rather than lived; the mentor memory is expository rather than a present-tactic pivot. Still, the final “peculiar kind of peace” lands as Earned Stasis because every earlier beat has foreshadowed her willingness to pay in anonymity and erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s quiet obsession with “structural linguistics” is particular and embodied; her tactile handling of the seal and the kettle shows a hierarchy of values (knowledge > social ease). Marcus’s admission about his grandmother externalizes the internal contradiction and forces the relationship’s state change. The final “Teach me” is earned: her past loneliness (unsent letters) makes the risk of sharing her gift legible. Minor slip: “patiently nimble” is repeated as label rather than shown in a fresh micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marina’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shell’s cut palm while fearing its return—are dramatized in continuous beats. The moment she chooses to dig with bare hands, the cost of reclaiming grief is made visceral and specific. One micro-choice (pressing the halves together) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: integration over anesthesia. Earned stasis lands with visible scar.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei’s contradictory drives—beauty-maker vs. document-destroyer—collide in the moment she lets both forgeries burn; the embodied tremor of blood on the thorn makes her renunciation kinesthetic and costly. Interiority never lectures; instead, the ink’s smell and marble’s cold keep her guilt sensory. The chain of inherited vengeance is broken by a single, irreversible micro-choice whose price (her exposed life) is legible before she climbs the stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Senna’s “richly perceptive” gift is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—pressing the shell, hearing bone-deep frequencies, deciding to sing herself into the echo. The interior contradiction (longing to know vs. terror of vanishing) is active in every beat; the final renunciation is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost—her individual voice dissolves. No stock therapy-speak; even the grandmother’s summons arrives as concrete shell heat. Characterization is near-flawless; the only hairline slip is the off-stage “tourists uncomfortable” line, a faint tell rather than shown pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marina’s grief-worn obsession and tactile handling of the globe give credible motive; yet her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“salvage artist of impossible things”) that feels externally authored rather than embodied under pressure. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene—the choice to transcribe the formula is presented as destined, so the final ascent, while costly, lacks the sting of a path foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    The net-mender’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers, the pulse in her palms, the hum in the bamboo—but she never makes a micro-choice that risks anything; all action is observation or ritual repetition. The “demure audacity” is asserted, never dramatized: she never tests the villagers’ scorn, never hesitates at a knot that could lose a fisherman’s catch, never confronts the whispering stones. Because no live option is foreclosed, the Earned Stasis feels conceptual rather than paid. The solitude is atmospheric, not crucible; we admire her, but we do not feel her lose or gain a thing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s skeptical profession and his decision to rebury the truth are cleanly motivated; the moment he covers the diamond again carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“his worldview tilting”), but a few stock phrases—“flawed diamond,” “broken heart”—flatten specificity. The endurance choice is earned, yet we never feel his body under fallout stress, so embodiment stays partial.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Marlowe’s obsession with “variant allegiance” is dramatized through her risky ritual of storm-broadcasting; the moment she tilts the panel into rain while gear screams shows a credibly self-endangering micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete (“tomorrow tastes like copper and rebellion”) without therapy-speak. The final earned stasis—she smiles knowing she’ll never meet the Prophet yet midwifes him—pays the cost of lifelong solitude. Flaw: no contradictory impulse on the page; she never hesitates or explores what she forfeits beyond loneliness, so the arc is slightly monochrome.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marcus’s shift from collector to “translator” is legible and earned through the causal chain of finding-playing-returning the music box; his interiority stays concrete (“tears carved clean tracks”) and the final micro-choice—handing over the grandson’s number—carries visible cost to his loner identity. The only drag is a slight therapy-speak lift in “understanding that every discarded thing… carried within them a melody worth saving,” which softens the otherwise taut embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interior contradiction—mathematical certainty against ancestral terror—is dramatized in embodied micro-choices (hand tremor, larynx micro-adjustment). The final dispersal into beacon-song is an earned renunciation foreclosed by prior causal chain; cost is visible in the abandoned coat and the melted key. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are bone-deep and ice-bright. Azure coat functions as both professional skin and abandoned humanity—irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kira’s interiority is concrete—meteorite-iron instruments, palm on cold basalt—and her 17-year vigil manifests as embodied patience, not label. Micro-choices (placing each copper rod while restraining the urge to run) externalize the “sculpt patience from impatience” motive with visible cost. The final quiet smile is a credible renunciation of loud rebellion, earned by the slow ritual. Status/relationship pressure is absent (Tomás is only a courier), capping the score short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Margot’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the lantern’s weight as “promise,” the resignation micro-choice—but the epiphany (“she understood now why she’d been drawn…”) is delivered as declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, blunting the felt cost of her pivot. Jerome’s memories are channeled competently, yet his own on-page flaw/struggle is filtered through her perception, so his liberation-by-cardiac-arrest reads as poetic fiat, not earned character collapse. Still, her final stance crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible forfeiture (career, reputation), satisfying the Earned Stasis test.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Eliza’s interior contradiction—her inherited grace versus inherited wreckage—drives every micro-choice at the bench; the final “choice to transform an apology into action” is earned through the tactile gear-turns she performs under Marcus’s witness. Thomas remains off-page yet his tremor-vs-repair contradiction is made legible in Eliza’s wrists and in the journal’s copper annotations. The only softness is a hairline slip at “maybe we deserve better,” which edges toward therapeutic self-diagnosis rather than embodied cost; this keeps it just shy of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pioneer’s yearning algorithm is a strong, embodied motive—copper-vein ambition literalized—but the interior contradiction is told (“immune to doubt”) rather than shown under peer pressure. Micro-choices are present (lens adjustments, dive) yet the decisive dive feels telegraphed; the acid-sea baptism costs the world more than it visibly costs her. Secondary machines are atmospheric chorus, not relationship crucible, so status-pressure is absent. Still, the brass-prism etchings give a vivid, irreversible body-mod that earns the transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lila’s interiority is concrete—“towers of obsolete servers… graveyard of deleted profiles”—and her motive (find Dad/4827) is legible, but the climactic self-upload is declared rather than dramatized; we see no contradictory impulse in-scene, so the final cost feels foregone, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrically sketched—“shadows danced lighter” gives embodied change—but her contradictory impulses stay summary (“anger before she’d learned to weave shadows”). The keeper is atmospheric furniture; no status pressure or micro-choice from him tests her. The apple-eating moment lands as symbol, not renunciation with cost. Peacekeeper identity is asserted, never weaponized or jeopardized, so the arc feels thematic rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marlene’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the parasol tip as tactile rosary and her calibrated sense of “ending pitch” are specific and character-bound. The contradiction between seeking death and finding patience-as-movement is dramatized in scene rather than labeled. Micro-choices (volunteering for night watch, gripping the lace until it cuts) enact a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Secondary characters remain functional; the Inuit grandmother’s mirroring is efficient but not a crucible, capping relationship pressure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marcus’s stoic endurance and quietly lyrical worldview are credibly anchored in vineyard labor; the “gently persuasive” trait shows in his micro-choice to salvage the letter fragment and later to invite Elena’s daughter to the bench. Interiority is concrete—his fingers on the burned edge, the way dusk tastes—but the final gesture of invitation leans slightly therapeutic (“rediscovering through parallel stories”) rather than exposing fresh contradiction under pressure. Still, the earned stasis of accepting incomplete love while opening space for new growth carries visible cost in the amber light, satisfying the closure lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    The half-masked line walker’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—”she understood immediately” tells more than dramatizes. Her final unmasking carries symbolic weight yet feels pre-ordained rather than driven by a visible, costly choice on the page. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the epiphany is delivered by the prophet’s voice first, then ratified by her. Still, the vocational identity is memorable and the ending image of scars-as-boundaries is specific enough to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Elara’s calm-observer stance is consistent, yet she never faces a hard micro-choice that visibly costs her; the decisive pivot to “complete the work” is stated, not dramatized under pressure. Interiority leans scenic rather than embodied, so the spiral-making feels communal, not personally crucible-tested. The lack of a visible personal stake or flaw keeps the arc safely illustrative rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elena’s reticence and etymological obsession are vividly shown through her crystal-gazing and preference for silence; her internal contradiction—yearning to defend living language while fearing confrontation—drives the final choice to testify in fractured sequences. The “weathered innocence” is embodied, not labeled, in her gentle defiance. Yet the Committee remains a faceless monolith, so relationship pressure is absent and the micro-choice to speak feels more symbolic than costly; the cost is implied, not felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ezra’s amnesiac-prophet condition drives every beat: he writes, forgets, then pays the emotional price when the prophecy arrives. The woman’s entrance feels slightly under-motivated—she appears because the chalk said so, not from an active want that collides with his maze. Interiority stays concrete (“the strange sorrow of understanding he’d known this moment would arrive”) and the final renunciation—helping even though he’ll forget—earns its cost under the Accumulative lens. Secondary pressure is light; she is more catalyst than crucible, so relationship dynamics don’t fully activate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ezra’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the dome glass, the tuning-fork memory—but the “reluctant guardian” motive is declared, not dramatized; she never resists or debates the role, so the turn from repairer to keeper feels pre-granted rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.7)
    Maya’s “serene therapist” persona is established through her ritualized music-making, but interiority stays at a lyric remove; we see calm hands and decisive kindness yet no rupture that would let us feel the fracture she claims in the mirror moment. The terminal prognosis, the single motive engine, is declared rather than dramatized, so her final renunciation reads graceful but externally smooth rather than torn from contradictory impulses. Because no micro-choice visibly costs her a live alternative—she never contemplates fleeing, silence, or rage—the arc is more luminous stencil than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s quietly deliberate precision and scholarly hunger are shown through tactile micro-choices—how she palms the key, climbs, traces runes in air. The inherited-guardian turn is credible because her mentor’s cryptic note and reversed automaton output dramatize the cost of knowledge before she accepts the role. Interiority stays concrete (“key weighed cold”) and avoids label-speak; the final solitude carries visible cost. Minor slip: mentor backstory is summarized rather than lived, muting the emotional crucible that could have pushed her from student to warden.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thomas’s skepticism-turned-forgiving-awareness is dramatized in micro-choices (returning the tooth, kneeling to weave the nest); the interior contradiction between loss and acceptance is visible. The final renunciation—pressing the tooth back—carries felt cost and is catalyzed by prior beats. Only the “shrewdly innocent” label is asserted, not embodied in a locatable action, a minor flaw that keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marina’s interiority is specific—tactile star-chart memory, the heft of glass, circular lens-polishing motions—yet her decisive turn (glow → beacon) arrives with a whiff of inherited destiny rather than a contradiction she must swallow. The “grandfather’s cryptic words” shortcut bypasses a visible flaw that could have forced a costlier micro-choice. Still, her embodied emotion and gem-polisher craft knowledge thread cleanly through every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kira’s quiet reclamation of the server room is embodied through tactile gardening gestures; the offer of moss to Marcus crystallizes her shift from wounded exile to mentor. Interiority stays concrete—sunlight on pendant, drip cadence—avoiding label-speak. The cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity by inviting a witness inside her sanctuary. Yet Marcus arrives more as symbolic penitent than active pressure source, so relationship crucible heating stays mild.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marina’s interior contradiction—clinging to stories while learning to release them—surfaces early and culminates in the on-page renunciation of the shell. Yet her “lucidly watchful” stance is asserted more than embodied; no bodily cost or visible mistake undercuts it, so the final release feels lightly earned rather than paid for in sweat or blood.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s interiority is vivid—she “traces the withered tendril” and “cracks with emotion”—and her micro-choice to hum rather than tinker sustains the lens. Yet the story withholds any contradictory impulse; she never doubts, hesitates, or weighs the personal cost of becoming the village’s hinge. The result is a luminous but frictionless arc: we see her fix the world, not confront herself. Closure is beautiful, but the price is paid by the vine, not by Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    The alchemist’s interiority is concrete and particular—every micro-choice (placing an apple core with “deliberate care,” counting crater-beats) is tethered to her idiosyncratic goal of mapping impossible geographies. Contradictory impulses (patience vs. seventeen-hour pulse, permanence vs. flash-paper) coexist in-scene and escalate to the earned, visible cost of the final warm plate. No stock phrasing; body and tool handling are inseparable from motive. The ending renunciation—carrying directions to places that shouldn’t exist—caps her arc with unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s occupation and temperament are vividly fused—her locksmith’s habit of “never focusing directly” mirrors her method of reverse-engineering time itself. Interior contradiction is present yet mild: she wants to repair yet chooses to document malfunction, a renunciation that costs her full mastery of the device. The decision is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping her just shy of the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile communion with the lamp burner, the angle-tilt ritual—but the “fractal weaver” gift is asserted more than dramatized; we see beautiful outputs, not the moment-to-moment struggle of splitting/reforming that would reveal contradictory impulses. The collected weights are poetic, yet no micro-choice shows her wavering between adding one more burden versus hurling one away, so the renunciation at the end feels pre-destined rather than earned under pressure. The 17 g of brass is a lovely specificity, but its heaviness is told (“grew heavier each time”) rather than felt through a tremor, sweat, or dropped stitch.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Margaret’s interiority is concrete—knife grip, scent of ash, the feel of unfinished grain—yet the “hauntingly practical” trait is stated more than dramatized. The decisive micro-choice—carving a clock face without hands—crystallizes her shift from mourning to carrying forward, but the cost is felt more as theme than as tangible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “weathered,” her head “spinning worse than the carousel”—yet her contradictory impulses (archive vs rebuild) are summarized rather than acted out in a single visible micro-choice. The ghost functions as an external conscience, so the “relationship” crucible is diluted; negotiation stays verbal, no physical stake risked. Closure renunciation is signaled, but the causal bridge from scavenger to memory-keeper is compressed into one speech paragraph; the cost is declared (“these fragments—they’re instructions”) rather than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Maya’s curiosity and engineering mindset stay consistent, but interiority slips into abstractions (“stoic wonder,” “mechanics of hope”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice after the valve-turns shows cost or risk; the resurrection succeeds on first try. The notebook closing is a gesture, not a renunciation that forecloses anything. She reads as competent and determined, yet the arc lacks a visible flaw or price that would make the triumph feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for music yet clinging to sanctuary silence—are dramatized in her micro-choice to walk deeper into the forecourt while fingering the letter. The final decision to accept the Conservatory post while keeping her scribe duties feels earned: her 23-year archive of “compositions of words” proves she has already evolved, not surrendered. Cost is visible: she must now inhabit two incompatible temporal orders, each demanding total attention. Interiority stays concrete and pianist-specific; only “stone in her chest” drifts toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interior contradiction—hoarding legends to avoid her father’s complicity—drives every beat: the tactile search of the false wall, the engine-cut drift, the decision to dock and confront. Emotions stay embodied (“mirror-black water,” “weathered hands”) without diagnostic speak. The renunciation of globe-trotting is earned by the prior cascade of mirrored confessions and carries visible cost: she pockets the sundial for a museum, not for herself. No secondary character on deck, so status dynamics N/A; headcount stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete—fingers numbing, breath visible—yet her contradictory mix of scholarly hunger and grief stays implicit. The “philosophical seed collector” label is shown rather than defined through her tactile decoding of knots. No second on-page character means relationship crucible is N/A; her micro-choice to teach the girl tomorrow crystallizes values with visible cost (sleep, warmth, solitude). Voice stays coherent under pressure; only minor slip is the over-tidy epiphany about “eternal truth” which rings abstract beside her embodied patience.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete, character-specific, and threaded through embodied micro-choices (winding the thread, writing Marcus in air). Contradictory impulses—mapping wounds vs. “peace”—co-exist without tidy epiphany. The final “map” stance is earned by the carpet’s progressive unraveling and her nightly projections; cost is felt in the wrist-pulse sync. No other characters on page, so relationship bullets correctly ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Aldric’s gaunt frame, fevered eyes, and obsessive micro-adjustments embody a man frayed by solitude and desperation; the broken bird he coaxes into life externalises his own warped survival. His “trembling hands” and cracked voice give visceral interiority, and the renunciation implied in accepting Novo’s asymmetry lands as credible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatised in scene, and the micro-choices remain functional rather than hierarchy-revealing under life-or-death pressure; still, the arc of flawed creator / flawed creation feels individual and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s contradictory interior currents—inheritance of fire-hunger versus vocation of rescue—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices: packing the coin with sand, pressing it to her sternum. The final renunciation of her father’s legacy is earned by these visible, cost-carrying gestures rather than abstract assertion. Flaws (inherited hunger, potential freeze under flame) remain active; no diagnostic self-talk. Interiority stays body-anchored and profession-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s skepticism is asserted rather than embodied; the luminous trait never alters his perceptions or choices. The woman’s “patient fury of geological ages” is vivid but external, not demonstrated through micro-gesture. His decision to stay lacks visible internal friction or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Keeper’s lone-sentinel premise supplies a consistent interior motive—collect starlight without fire—yet her choices never tighten; she drifts, observes, remembers, but nothing is hazarded or forfeited. The only micro-choice—pressing the gear to a dying star—recurs without altering tactics. Affective cost is asserted (“burden,” “privilege”) rather than dramatized, so the arc is static, not steeled. Still, the ethereal POV is coherent and emotionally particular, satisfying the 9- gate’s contradictory-impulse test.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Interiority is concrete—Martha’s fingers “retrace the practice cuts”—but the contradiction between fierce meditation and spectral mentorship is summarized, not dramatized in real time. The grandfather’s voice is a convenient oracle that removes genuine struggle; Martha never mis-carves or doubts aloud, so her “fiercely meditative state” feels label-only. Micro-choices (reading poems alone, touching stone) show values but cost is abstract—no blisters, no scraped knuckles, no risk of public failure—so endurance reads friction-free.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theodore’s compulsive penance—counting stairs, carving names in microscopic script, delivering 1,847 turns exactly—creates a taut interior contradiction between duty and guilt that externalizes in every physical act. The rake-handle litany is an embodied tally of shame, not abstract guilt, and its final relinquishment costs him the tool of self-flagellation, a visible price. Interiority rarely slips into diagnostic talk; instead, the body carries the crime (splinters against ribs, voice echoing in brass). The shift from secret restitution to communal witness is earned because the village’s new, clearer chime is the audible proof that his micro-confessions have mechanically re-tuned time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marta’s interiority is textured—“velveteen gloom,” root-system patience—but her one visible micro-choice is to let the chess clock stay silent; all other action is memory or tapestry reading. The final decision to plant the fragment is announced, not dramatized, so the cost is only conceptual. Traits align (night gardener, quilterly care), yet no contradictory impulse pressures her on-page. Earned endurance is present, but the path feels pre-set; the tapestry, not Marta, supplies the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid and specific—her tactile ritual with the quill, her contempt for “suffocating protocols,” her private smile at the footprints—yet her inner contradictions stay mostly declarative rather than enacted in a single, pressurized beat. The kingfisher nib recurs as an extension of her perceptual signature, but no moment forces her to choose between sabotage and loyalty with visible cost; the triumph feels pre-assured. Still, her voice is individuated and her hierarchy of values (subtle influence > overt revolt) governs every micro-choice, satisfying the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mariel’s interiority is concrete—she “adjusts the dial with practiced delicacy,” “feels no fear, only a thistled calm,” and chooses to weave forbidden notes into official scores. The causal chain from grandmother’s whisper to dust-ink to tomorrow’s gala is legible, and her endurance (“luminous burden”) shows cost. Still, we get one static emotional register; no contradictory impulse in-scene complicates her steady resolve, so the arc is more mission than multifaceted character.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marlene’s contradictory impulses—protecting fugitives while documenting them—are dramatized through the ash ritual and mask gesture; her final stride through the portrait crystallizes renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“she knew better”) and embodied (porcelain edges press skin). The burned-record ash and inherited mask tie flaw to tactic, making her complicity inevitable. Choice to scatter Thomas rather than preserve him is earned by earlier pattern of ephemeral absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s abrasive calm and solitary vigilante-scholar persona is vivid, but the interior contradiction—his yearning for an ally—only surfaces in the final beat; earlier his motives stay static, so the pivot to acceptance feels mildly under-cooked. The woman’s sudden disclosure of covert truth-keeping is believable because her grandfather anecdote supplies a concrete cue, yet her emotional stakes remain externally summarized. Closure choice (“Show me your method”) is legible and earned, but the cost is more conceptual than embodied; we don’t feel his body or voice crack in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Chen’s interior contradiction—clutching a heritage she half-understands while dismantling prejudice in others—is dramatized through the micro-choice to hand the zither over rather than hoard it. Embodied emotion arrives in the “eyes filled” beat that condenses forty years of loss and pride into one physiological flash. The renunciation costs her the last physical link to her grandfather, a price legible on the page, yet the gesture enacts the very pedagogy she preached, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor slip: “expectantly resigned” is stated twice rather than lived through body or action, a label that keeps this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mira’s “informally wise” label is repeated but never dramatized; her interiority drifts into editorial abstraction (“memories are like weeds—they find a way”). The synaptic-tasting gift is asserted, not embodied in scene. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her final quiet stance, so the renunciation feels lightly earned rather than crucible-forged.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mira's involuntary honesty and her motivation to protect the bees are clear and embodied; her micro-choice to broadcast the confession costs her the secrecy she cherishes. Interiority stays specific ("the words tasted wrong"). The final renunciation—stepping into the open as thief-savior—carries visible cost. Secondary citizens are more witness than crucible, so relationship pressure is light, but her single-POV arc meets the length-appropriate standard.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marina’s quiet cartographer persona is vivid and consistent; her choices to trace, pocket, and finally surrender the shard are micro-turns that cost her the comfort of distance. Interiority stays concrete—violet warmth spreading through skin—without diagnostic self-labeling. The only drag is that her “why” remains a touch abstract until the final paragraph, softening the causal bite just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thessaly’s interiority is vivid—her centuries of sentient paralysis are felt in every telepathic pulse—yet her final shift from verdict-seeking to witness-bearing is more asserted than dramatized; the “structural weakness” metaphor is told rather than shown pressing on her stony body. Marina’s micro-choice to ascend while framing the new narrative is clear, but her prior academic identity is sketched only in shorthand (“everything she’d published”), softening the cost of reputational ruin. The pair’s shared moral ambiguity is credibly layered, yet the absence of a tangible beat where Thessaly consciously lets go of judgment keeps the arc a fraction short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    Marcus’s interiority is vivid—equations tattooed on skin, dice rolled to “give texture to the missed opportunity”—but his contradictory impulses alternate rather than clash in-scene. The promised flaw (grim optimism) is asserted more than dramatized; we never see him dare against self-interest, only ascend patiently. Cost is conceptual (eternal climb) rather than embodied, so the renunciation feels abstract. Still, the voice is idiosyncratic and consistent, keeping him individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mira’s insomnia and creative drought are credibly embodied; her micro-choice to dip the brush in saffron paint and paint unknown symbols is the single visible decision that alters her situation. The “methodically hopeful” trait, however, is asserted rather than dramatized in contradictory action, so the interior conflict feels narrated, not enacted. Because the brush does the remembering for her, the cost of agency is displaced onto the object, muting the felt price of her own endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Marta’s archivist desperation is vivid—her trembling fingers, the frantic charcoal tracings, the lens pressed to stone—yet the interior contradiction is more asserted (“dread” vs “fierce tenderness”) than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The bread-initial alphabet is a lovely externalization of identity, but her decision to keep copying as the walls weep is the only on-page fork, and its cost feels scaled to the story’s lyric register rather than to her body or future. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the flaw is credible but safely museum-bound. Voice and motive stay consistent; the opera-glass POV bias is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara’s lifetime obsession with backward clocks is vivid and embodied; the yoyo-key and grandmother’s journals give concrete lineage to her skills. Interior contradiction is thin—no moment where she doubts reversing the stone—and the “bleak exhilaration” is asserted rather than shown in body or choice. Still, her final laugh carries a felt cost: she accepts a life sentence of tending retro-light. Micro-choices (winding copper counter-clockwise, dismantling lens backward) tightly align motive and method.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mara’s contradictory impulses—repulsion yet nightly return—are embodied in tactile gestures (hand on warm mirror, gagging inhale). The clasp’s cold permanence and the backward-reading ritual dramatize a credible micro-choice chain that ends in earned renunciation: she carries Fear forward rather than fleeing. Interiority stays specific to her sensorium; no therapeutic self-labeling. Visible cost: the ruby eye closing, carnival finally silent. Missing 9-band only because Cornelius’s advisor function is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kessa’s interiority is vivid—her bones ringing, the mallet pulsing “like a second heart”—and every strike is a micro-choice that compounds cost. The flaw is slight over-articulation (“She smiled, knowing…”) that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness, trimming the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motivation is consistent: Mira’s need to understand patterns and find her mentor drives every action. Interiority is concrete—ink bleeding where her hand trembles, tracing spirals—without stock phrasing. Internal conflict is present but light: the tension between safety inside Carapace and the need to know; we see only one impulse (quest) without simultaneous contradiction in scene. Emotions are embodied (salt-thick air, hand tremble) and avoid diagnostic labels. Micro-choice to leave through the hatch is visible and stakes-scale fits length; the cost is implied by the groaning turtle, giving a credible endurance moment. No secondary character pressure, so relationship bullets skipped. Backstory/reflection is minimal and anchored (spiral maps, mentor). Closure effect is conceptual—she accepts pursuit into the unknown—but the cost is more environmental than personal; the reader feels the city destabilizing more than Mira’s psyche. Voice is coherent, quietly determined, and remains consistent. The piece avoids 8-band because the decisive change lands more on the world than on her internal stance; the emotional price is present but oblique.

    <comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira steps through the hatch while the turtle begins to move, reconfiguring safety into migration. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (spirals, watchers, cracks) reweights stakes rather than causal dominoes. Orientation is clean within 120 words: who (Mira), where (edge of Carapace), when (three days after whistle silence). Causality is intact: each micro-act (mapping, climbing, packing, slipping out) follows clearly. One meaningful tightening occurs when she translates the inverted spiral message—knowledge that forecloses staying. No teleporting props; the whistle, charts, compass, and hatch are all pre-planted. No outline-like “and-then” sequencing; each beat either increases pattern dread or narrows her options. Final image carries undeniable conceptual cost: the city becomes a migrating target, and her maps are suddenly obsolete. No soft resets; the rusted gate stays sealed, the turtles keep waking. No explain-everything exposition; lore emerges through pattern translation and action. The ending is quiet but charged; the groan of the turtle is the audible price. Under the Accumulative lens, the final image reweights every prior spiral she drew, turning her knowledge into liability—this satisfies closure with cost.

    <comment>Setting is vivid and selective: “salt-thick air,” “calcified stairs,” “sunlight felt heavy”—each detail serves mood rather than cataloging. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s cartographer bias: she notices angles, spirals, cracks before color. The city-on-turtles premise is learned through action (climbing the shell’s central whorl) rather than exposition. Spatial choreography is clean: she starts at the edge, moves to observatory, descends to hatch; bodies and objects track logically. Weather/tone integration: the pale-gold zenith light should comfort but instead “fills her with dread,” mirroring the inverted spiral theme. No anachronisms; world rules (gargantuan turtles, acoustic whistle codes) stay consistent. Micro-setting functions: the telescope and charts act as extensions of her body and constrain her choices. Environmental details evolve: the watchers’ stone eyes open, turtles groan—causal feedback from the expedition’s trespass. No white-room syndrome; every mentioned space is walked through or touched. The crack on the watcher’s face is both literal fissure and readable text, fusing setting with plot information. Tone of sunwashed dread is maintained: bright warmth paired with geological menace. The story meets length and scope defaults: single POV, 1–2 on-page characters, one continuous scene. Backstory is kept minimal (≤20%) and anchored in present stimuli (the missing whistle note). No mid-paragraph head-hopping; focalization stays tight on Mira. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: city becomes migratory, maps become useless—felt cost is the inversion of her life’s work.
    
    <question>4</question>
    <grade>7.9</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—find the expedition and her mentor—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each new pattern (silent whistle, rusted gate, cracked watcher, inverted spiral) deepens dread rather than creating causal reversals. One meaningful tightening occurs when she deciphers the watchers’ warning—this knowledge forbids pursuit and yet propels her outward, narrowing her moral choice to “stay safe” vs “know truth.” Agency is clear: she packs, climbs, slips through hatch; no off-stage resolution. Cost is conceptual but legible: the turtles wake, the city becomes prey, her maps are invalidated. No coincidence resolves conflict; the groaning turtle complicates, not saves. Internal/external conflicts interweave: her need to know clashes with civic safety, then with planetary-scale peril. No repetitive loops; each spiral revelation adds new weight. The final image crystallizes stakes: she steps into a world where her instruments are obsolete. Moral calculus is present: she chooses knowledge over collective safety, foreclosing the path back. Under Accumulative lens, the density of inverted patterns reweights the dominant stake from rescue to survival. Closure is earned: every beat of pattern study leads to the moment she must abandon pattern itself. The reader feels the cost through the geological groan that follows her exit. Quiet endings qualify when resonance is built from particulars; here the particulars are the spirals she trusted, now made hostile. No abstract sermonizing; theme emerges from the inversion of her life’s craft. The city's transformation from refuge to prey is irreversible, satisfying the “persistent constraint” test for high-band pressure. The story’s length and single-scene default are observed; no shard transitions. Reflection is interleaved with present choices and stays under 20%. The ending offers a charged poise: options narrowed, meaning reconfigured, cost audible.
    
    <question>5</question>
    <grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from specific images—spirals, cracks, groans—rather than overt statements. Subtext operates in the inversion of the spiral language: the tool of understanding becomes a warning. Core concept (lost expedition) integrates with theme by turning “search and rescue” into “awaken ancient peril.” Emotional aftereffect is concrete: the reader feels the ground literally shift under a city. No final-paragraph moralizing; the groan of the turtle replaces any thesis statement. Complexity is embraced: Mira’s drive for knowledge is both heroic and catastrophically destabilizing. Dramatic irony is present—the reader deciphers the watchers’ warning alongside Mira, but the city’s fate is already sealed. Thematic resonance arises from the specificity of cartographic spirals becoming unreadable; no generic abstraction. Earned wisdom: “maps become obsolete” is shown through geological motion, not told. Final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question: the price of knowing is homelessness. The protagonist’s internal arc is inextricable from the theme—her identity as pattern-reader is nullified by the pattern coming alive. Quiet, lyric endings are not penalized when resonance is built from particulars; here the groan is the audible particular. No symbolic convenience; the watchers’ crack is both data and disaster. Conceptual integrity: the story commits fully to walking turtles and sees the implication through to migratory apocalypse. Risk distinction: choosing a quiet geological ending over a heroic rescue is a non-obvious, bold choice that heightens meaning without gimmickry. The ending reweights the premise: Carapace is no longer a city but a vessel in motion, and Mira’s knowledge is suddenly worthless.

    <comment>Voice is distinct: “salt-thick air,” “calcified stairs,” “geological groan” create a perceptual signature tied to Mira’s cartographer mind. POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful: “The reed whistle had gone silent three days ago” teaches the reader to expect elliptical, high-density openings. Patterned elision is taught early—each spiral reference is shorthand for a system we trust will pay off. Psychic distance is controlled: we move from external observation to internal translation of cracks without jarring shift. Prose rhythm varies: long sentence for setup, clipped fragments under pressure (“A crack.”). Filter verbs are avoided; perception is direct. Dialogue is absent, so dialogue bullets skipped. Diction stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon; “central whorl” is technical but motivated. No register drift into academic abstraction. Internal monologue is formatted cleanly in italics where used. Unreliability is not attempted; narration is reliable and anchored to what Mira can see or infer. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere; no scaffold such as “she noticed that” or “it seemed to her.” The opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by image rather than explanation: the groan is the punctuation. Under peak stress, diction compresses to single-word sentences (“A crack.”) yet remains legible. No syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. Paragraph lengths create visual rhythm: short paragraph for the crack to give it white-space impact. No choreographic clutter; we get only the movements that matter (traces spiral, adjusts lens, packs, slips through hatch). Texture is achieved through nouns and verbs rather than stacked modifiers. Metaphors are sparse but precise: “a prayer unanswered” for the whistle’s last note. The prose breathes during the telescope beat, then accelerates into the packing sequence, matching emotional tempo. No thesaurus-itis; “barnacle-crusted borders” is vivid yet plain. Proofreading is clean: no typos, consistent tense, proper punctuation of compound adjectives. Opening and closing images echo each other—silent whistle vs groaning turtle—creating satisfying circularity without overt symmetry.

    <grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>Sentences perform double duty: “The gate had rusted shut seventeen days ago” delivers time, stakes, and world logic in one blow. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new information or emotional charge. Figurative language is restrained: only two metaphors in the entire piece, both precise. Mixed-metaphor check: none found; salt, rust, stone, and shell all belong to the same coastal material family. Information density is high yet never overwhelms: 738 words carry world, character, plot, and theme. Read-aloud rhythm is natural; sentence lengths vary from one word to 28 words without drumbeat repetition. Opening sentence is arresting and teaches the elliptical pattern. No scaffolding such as “she decided to” or “it was then that”; actions are direct. Paragraph cut test passed: removing any paragraph would lose either knowledge, intention, or emotional charge. Strong verbs dominate: “traced,” “climbed,” “slipped,” “groan.” Passive voice appears once (“had gone silent”) for anterior exposition and is justified. No simultaneity errors; sequential actions are clearly ordered. Tense remains past throughout. Punctuation is clean, including em-dash for crack reveal. No buried lead; key information (whistle silence, gate rust, crack appearance) is placed at paragraph openings. Textual specificity: “central whorl” instead of “center,” “ reed whistle” instead of “flute.” No corporate register drift. No repetitive sentence stems; openings vary between noun phrases, participial phrases, and direct objects. Closing line resolves by sonic image rather than abstract summary. No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate. No typos or homophone errors. Micro-movements are narrated only when they carry meaning: “hand trembled” shows emotional stakes. The piece avoids over-describing; three details per beat are enough to anchor without clutter. Single-word paragraph “A crack.” is justified for shock beat. No explanatory filler; the reader infers danger from the groan, not from narrator commentary.

    <grade>9.3</grade>
    <comment>Premise fusion: city built on gargantuan turtles merged with spiral cartography creates a fresh mythos not seen in standard templates. Tropes are transformed: “lost expedition” becomes the catalyst that wakes the city’s foundation; “stone watchers” shift from scenery to warning system. Risk-taking appears in the quiet ending—geological groan instead of heroic rescue—eschewing conventional catharsis. Specificity creates freshness: “ink bleeding where her hand trembled” is a precise, sensory fingerprint. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty: the fear of obsolete knowledge is universally resonant. Conceptual integrity: the story commits to turtle migration and follows the logic to its apocalyptic but non-violent conclusion. No derivative premise penalty; while “city on turtles” exists in fantasy, the spiral cartography and inverted pattern language are non-obvious inflections. The final image reweights all prior spirals from guides to threats, achieving conceptual repricing. The ending is quiet yet charged, fulfilling the criteria for high literary taste without spectacle. The piece earns its originality through internal logic and emotional specificity rather than gimmick.
    
    <question>9</question>
    <grade>6.2</grade>
    <comment>Character traits and world logic integrate into a fresh synthesis; the spiral-shell cartographer is not a stock role and shapes every decision. The reed whistle’s silence propels the plot yet is not over-explained. The lost expedition concept moves from MacGuffin to geological trigger, giving it causal weight. Sunwashed dread tone is coherent and modulates from passive anxiety to active menace as cracks widen. The gate rusting shut is a persistent constraint that alters tactics and charges the final image. Each element is indispensable: remove turtles and the city has no motion; remove spirals and Mira has no identity or method; remove the inverted crack and there is no warning. The combination produces a non-obvious synthesis where cartography causes apocalypse, satisfying the transformation test.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara’s motives are coherent—her exile and scholarly vendetta are legible—but interiority leans on diagnostic labels (“emotional rationality”) rather than embodied contradiction. The illuminated letter functions as an externalized motive, yet the choice to transmit copies before Marcus arrives feels pre-decided, softening the stakes of her final stance. Marcus’s conflict is sketched too briskly to serve as crucible; his shift from enforcer to defector is announced, not dramatized, so the cost Elara pays is mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Edmund's contradictory drives—stoic duty vs. tender preservation—are embodied in the inkwell ritual and the knee-deep wade; the final sealing of his grandmother's bottle crystallizes a renunciation that costs him official sanction. Interiority stays concrete ("weight of witnessed absence") and avoids label-speak. Only flaw: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are N/A and cannot elevate to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mira’s occupation-driven perception (the “different frequency” test) is vivid, but her interior contradiction is told rather than dramatized in real time; the endurance choice is visible yet the cost is more conceptual than felt. Still, her professional lens shapes every beat and the final renunciation is consistent with her quiet obsessiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are strong; Mei's trembling fingers and the parallel between lantern-folding and grief-crane-folding show motives turning under pressure. The final shift—from absence to transformation—is earned via the thousand-gem accumulation, with visible cost in the luminous torment she hangs. Minor slip: “crafty nature” skirts diagnostic-speak, though it’s quickly grounded in glass-and-wire memory.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amira’s grief-rooted hunt is palpable; every micro-choice (pressing the geode, risking security) is tethered to the loss of her sister’s wedding party. Interiority is concrete: “Physics demanded it.” The final smile under arrest crystallizes her values—data freed, future reclaimed—so the renunciation is earned and costly. Only a trace of therapeutic self-diagnosis (“she felt… bleak exhilaration”) keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Kira’s perpetual surprise is named repeatedly but never shown as an embodied contradiction; her interiority stays safe and diagnostic (“made her gasp—again,” “breath caught”). The climactic shift to “perpetual wonder” is asserted, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs her anything. The pilgrim functions as oracle, denying Kira a relational crucible that would force visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elias’s inherited guilt and complicity are credibly embodied; the moment he fingers the Portuguese carving his contradictory impulses (profit vs. shame) collide in a single micro-gesture. Interiority stays concrete, but the climactic choice to “close his business, destroy his files” is declared rather than dramatized, blunting the felt cost and keeping the change short of full earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s interiority is concrete—patina grooves, brass weight, grandmother’s memory anchoring each micro-choice. She hedges vengeance for a staged forgiveness, a believable contradiction. Thorne’s apology is scraped, not tidy; his relief reads as bodily collapse. The final stance—acceptance as “down payment”—crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    Marcus’s guilt and self-doubt are credibly embodied—his empty flask, the “useless” compass, the exact count of poles marking his penance—yet the interior contradiction is told more than dramatized in the moment of decision (“Perhaps being broken didn’t mean being worthless” is an abstract epiphany). Sarah functions mainly as empathetic mirror rather than pressure source, so relationship-as-crucible is weak. The final micro-choice—to teach pole-navigation—earns its place and forecloses retreat, but the cost is only asserted, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Marcus’s amnesiac-guilt is sharply embodied (“surgical scars still ached”), but the old woman’s motives remain abstract; her dialogue explains rather than pressures. The decisive micro-choice—stepping onto the bridge—externalizes his compassion circuitry, yet we get no interior contradiction at the moment of commitment. Secondary pressure is missing; the woman functions as oracle, not antagonist. Still, the earned cost is visible: he walks forward into perpetual debt, memory erased but empathy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mira’s interiority is lyrical yet concrete; her contradictory terror and hunger to dissolve is shown through trembling hands and steady voice. The micro-choice to uncork the vial crystallizes her hierarchy of values—love over self-continuity—with visible cost. Kess remains a felt absence rather than a full second character, so relationship-as-crucible is lightly handled, but Mira’s un-becoming is credibly earned. Diagnostic label “paradoxically steady” is self-aware but brief enough to avoid full therapy-speak penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Elara’s grief-propelled quest feels lived-in; her interiority stays sensory (tracing the crack, catching star-drops) rather than diagnostic. The contradictory pull between guilt and reclamation is dramatized in the card-spread ritual that literally re-stitches time. Mother’s spectral arrival supplies external pressure, forcing Elara to crystallize her purpose, and the final image—her own face sliding into daughter-then-mother—shows earned change with visible cost. Voice stays individual; no stock "cartomancer" tropes intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mei’s pacifist training and lone-survivor status are strongly anchored; her micro-choices (tracing tears, dosing the photo) flow from these motives. Interior contradiction is absent—she never wavers—so the “steadfast” trait stays one-note. Because the story hinges on her serene acceptance, the lack of flaw or doubt is genre-justified, yet it caps depth. Earned cost is present in her bodily release, but the absence of a competing impulse keeps the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thorne’s watchful patience and quiet defiance feel lived-in; his fingers on the quill holder and silent alignment of angles dramatize a man who has waited seventeen years for this hour. Amara’s arrival adds relational pressure, yet her interiority is ventriloquised (“understanding softened her stern face”) rather than embodied. The final shared gaze crystallises complicity, but the cost to each remains implied, not tasted; we see alliance, not what they personally forfeit at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Yann’s interiority is specific—she feels the dust warm against her hip, sees time three beats ahead—and her curse complicates every motion. The micro-choice to scatter the dust anyway, knowing the outcome, shows contradictory impulses in scene. The final shift from receiver to transmitter of the pattern is earned, though the grandmother’s last-breath exposition feels conveniently packaged. Still, the cost of living each moment twice is kept palpable to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete—her steady breathing against lightning, the way deleted verses become her star-map. The “cartography of scars” obsession gives her a memorable, particular lens. Micro-choices (sliding the envelope behind the timetable, resetting the timer) externalize values and keep contradiction alive. Endurance-cost is felt: she forecloses the idea of open revolt and accepts perpetual smuggling, the price legible in dawn’s approaching routine.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Interiority is vivid—brass fingers ‘click’, angles ‘suggest’—and her lost-arm backstory is anchored to present micro-gesture. Status duel with Reeves is crisp, but the philosophical stakes stay cerebral; no bodily risk or tangible forfeiture is felt at closure, so renunciation cost is only conceptual. Still, contradictory impulses (code vs. revolt) coexist in-scene, not in summary, meeting the 9+ threshold for impulse-in-scene even if price is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    October’s rotating identities are dramatized through the tactile act of re-binding ruined pages; the monthly “molting” is not declared but performed as she lifts a scorched Neruda sheet to moonlight. The contradiction between her need for invisibility and her hunger to seed beauty is kept alive in every micro-choice, down to the coffee tin’s false bottom that both protects and endangers the network. The final smile and touch of the tin crystallize a credible endurance: she accepts the perpetual risk of exposure as the price of remaining legible only to the resistance. No stock labels intrude; even Marcus’s prison insight is filtered through her embodied memory of sorting torn books.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Marion’s contradictory impulses—ritual grief vs. strategic invention—are dramatized in every beat (tuning-less prelude, frame-counting, reckless Rachmaninoff acceleration). The final choice to keep playing, forfeiting the old compass-logic of “home,” is earned by the coral-piano harmonics she alone forged. Cost is visible: Sophia returns film-wet, years thinned, and Marion’s hands tremble on the last note. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is vivid—“heavier than grief,” “empirically whimsical warmth”—and her final ledger entry is a concrete micro-choice that prices her career against cultural survival. The contradiction between empirical duty and quantum folklore is felt, not labeled. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; her stance crystallizes alone, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Kenji’s grief and reticence are etched in every micro-choice—tracing lace, offering the compass, the decision to write tomorrow. His contradictions (teaching diffusion while hoarding unsaid words) play out in embodied beats. The student is sketched only as a mirror, so relationship pressure is thin, but Kenji’s interiority carries the piece. The earned cost—public admission of fear—is visible on the page, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite light secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is concrete and particular—her shift from abstract astrophysics to embodied observation feels earned through micro-choices (skipping meetings, daily visits). Her contradiction—craving precision yet drawn to organic chaos—is dramatized without therapy-speak. The resignation carries visible cost: career abandonment for epistemic humility. Final notebook line crystallizes her reconfigured values with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, frost-triggered memories, and conflicted awe at her father’s poisoned legacy feel specific and unforced. Her final choice to preserve life over legacy emerges organically from layered micro-decisions: reading the ledger, interpreting frost, rejecting replication. The emotional progression avoids diagnostic self-awareness; grief, revelation, and resolve intertwine without tidy resolution. Her renunciation of the studio—and identity—is earned with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, scientific rigor, and awe intertwine without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (selecting tuning forks, interpreting thermal patterns) reveal a hierarchy of values forged in loss. The contradiction between mourning Kepler and advancing his work feels lived-in, not abstract. Her transformation from passive survivor to “thermal composer” is earned through tactile engagement with the plants.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Silas’s insomnia, grief, and professional identity fuse into a coherent, embodied motivation that drives every key choice. His internal contradiction—giving rest to others while denied it himself—is dramatized through tactile details (trembling hands, teeth aching from the lens) rather than diagnostic labels. The final renunciation of his surface life for eternal service feels earned by his lifelong posture of stewardship. No emotional summarizing; his transformation emerges through ritual action, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marta’s motivation—rooted in intergenerational dignity—is embodied through precise micro-choices (rationing food, refusing credit) and contradicted by the world’s indifference, yet she persists without sentimentality. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; her wisdom emerges through action (“need has no face”). Samuel’s silent apprenticeship deepens their relationship as crucible, crystallizing Marta’s legacy without dialogue-heavy exposition. The final renunciation of personal recognition is earned by every prior midnight run.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mae’s interiority is vividly embodied—copper-taste memory, breath-shifting ritual—and her motivation (to find where unused love is stored) compels increasingly high-stakes choices. The ghost woman functions as a mirror, not a crutch, and Mae’s final act of release feels earned by prior causality. Her flaw—spiritual curiosity bordering on obsession—is consistent and costly, yet never safety-hedged. The micro-choice to open the camera back crystallizes her renunciation with palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling fingers, the warmth of the fragment, her laughter at the end—all reveal a psyche fractured yet cohering under temporal pressure. Her motivation (to grasp time’s texture) intensifies credibly through recursive design attempts across lifetimes. The final renunciation of the photographs feels earned, not epiphanic, with cost legible in the dissolving fragment and fading selves. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions pulse in every gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marcus’s motivation—liberation through patient rebellion—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly. His interiority is concrete (“feeling the weight of possibility”), embodied (chains singing, fingers tracing keys), and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to seed resilience over personal escape is earned by three years of micro-choices (filing chains, memorizing routines) with visible cost: his body remains scarred, his freedom conditional on mission completion. No secondary characters dilute focus; his flaws (isolation, obsession) complicate but don’t sabotage his arc.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s motivation—rooted in grief, scientific obsession, and inherited trauma—is embodied through precise sensory contradictions (hearing colors, seeking silence) and micro-choices (activating the forge, imprinting absence). Her internal conflict between innovation and emotional closure never resolves neatly but crystallizes into earned understanding. The grandfather’s off-page presence exerts pressure without diluting focus. Final renunciation of “half-heard” truth feels inevitable yet costly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cassia’s motivation—archaeology of light, not theft—is compellingly rooted in personal history and consistently drives her actions. Her interiority is concrete (“quietly savvy,” “fingers trailing across the bouquet”), and her micro-choices (using moonbeams to reveal truth, placing coded flowers) reflect a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. The mother’s presence sharpens Cassia’s moral stance without diluting her agency. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied through gesture and perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, resolve, and tenderness manifest through tactile ritual rather than exposition. Her contradictory impulses (abandonment vs. return, memory vs. creation) operate simultaneously in scene. The final choice—to craft vessels for others’ questions—is earned by her father’s legacy and personal rupture. Cost is legible: she trades prestige and safety for fragile hope in a poisoned place.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s internal contradiction—fear as both limitation and weapon—is embodied through tactile reactions (trembling flashlight, shell warmth) and micro-choices (decoding equations while driving). His transformation feels earned because his phobias directly enable his final tactic. Jake’s late reveal risks flatness, but his paternal betrayal sharpens the thematic stakes. The story narrowly avoids diagnostic label-speak by grounding “synthetic memory” in physical objects and maternal handwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oracle’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile rituals (tracing air, clutching the booklet) and emotionally precise contradictions—obsession versus patience, urgency versus stillness. Her micro-choice to close the booklet and descend, accepting delayed closure, earns Charged Poise with palpable cost: years more solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through sensory detail (“joints stiff from hours of stillness”). The “mildly obsessed” trait drives credible endurance without safety-hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Seven’s motivation—to locate the origin of thought—is dramatized through embodied curiosity and micro-choices (abandoning the mop, seventeen approaches to the violin). His “remarkably composed” trait isn’t just stated; it enables his temporal perception to function without disintegration, creating a credible endurance that forecloses panic as an option. The epiphany emerges from concrete sensory experience (“pause between one mop stroke and the next”), avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Interior contradiction is subtle but present: janitorial obedience versus emergent inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira and Samuel’s motivations are deeply rooted in protective loyalty and guilt, with micro-choices—eavesdropping, doodling corrections—that reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. Their internal contradictions (silence vs. honesty, protection vs. truth) act simultaneously, not sequentially. Emotions are embodied through ripples, breath-clouds, and tactile handling of the lens. The final hand-hold earns its weight through prior causality and visible relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marta’s contradictions—her withered hands nurturing defiant life, her lies as acts of care—are embodied in every gesture and choice. Her motivation is rooted in decades of quiet rebellion against a reductive system, and her final act of passing the marble crystallizes her ethos without sentimentality. The young woman’s inclusion creates immediate relational pressure that sharpens Marta’s legacy. Interiority remains concrete (“a smile both blooming and withering”) and never lapses into diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ira’s motivation—to prove time moves sideways—is compellingly embodied in her tactile engagement with the magnetic nexus and lever. Her interiority avoids diagnostic label-speak, instead revealing contradiction through action: she prioritizes discovery over station safety, yet remains technically precise. The micro-choice to ignore Vasquez’s warning while adjusting the lever crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. However, her emotional arc lacks a tangible renunciation or endurance that forecloses a concrete path—her transformation feels intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—driven by artistic obsession and grief—is consistent, embodied, and escalates credibly to his climactic choice. His internal contradiction (duty to the living vs. fidelity to the dead) manifests in micro-choices: transcribing alone, ignoring dismissal, stepping chest-deep into floodwater. The final endurance—holding the impossible note—forecloses his prior isolation with visible cost: he emerges changed, bearing a dual-signed score. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is conveyed through tactile detail (“throat moving without sound,” “violin held high”).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her fever, her oracle gift, and her tactile engagement with the illustration all reveal a character defined by contradiction and resilience. Her micro-choices (sleeping in the closet, drawing then smudging) express a hierarchy of values: protecting fragile truths over institutional validation. The final act of smudging her signature crystallizes her renunciation of official recognition with tangible cost—the truth remains marginal, vulnerable, but preserved. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory and spatial detail.

    Marcus’s skepticism, tactile engagement with decay, and final renunciation of possession reveal a coherent interiority shaped by Methodist doubt and urban-explorer pragmatism. His micro-choice to photograph rather than take the valve wheel crystallizes his hierarchy of values—witnessing over owning—with palpable cost: he carries “metal dust” in his bones. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. reverence, documentation vs. disturbance) act simultaneously without diagnostic label-speak. The radio confessions function as externalized conscience, not plot device, deepening his moral calibration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chronicle keeper’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile rituals (folding the swan, tracing air-patterns) and a consistent philosophy of “deliberate softening of certainty.” Her renunciation of speech is credible and charged with cost—she sacrifices communication to preserve her library’s “delicate ecology.” However, her choices lack contradictory impulses; she endures rather than wrestles, limiting emotional complexity. The final image of her as “pure witness” feels earned but leans toward idealized stasis over human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is richly embodied—her therapist’s “softly adaptive” voice modulates with emotional intensity, and her micro-choices (opening the envelope, playing the flute) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in decades of maternal love. Sofia’s presence acts as crucible: their shared history pressures Elena toward release, not retention. The final renunciation of the curl feels earned through consistent motivation and visible cost—the letting go of a lifelong talisman. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory detail and action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thrain’s interiority is richly embodied—her perception through touch, her grief for lost dreams, and her quiet resolve all feel specific and consistent. Her final choice to preserve the tapestry-diary synthesis demonstrates a credible endurance (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: she remains alone in the bronze quiet. No diagnostic label-speak or unearned epiphanies; contradictions surface in her simultaneous awe and sorrow. The story avoids head-hopping or external characters, focusing tightly on her sensory-driven cognition under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Chen’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied contradictions—his role as both manipulator and manipulated, composer and note. His micro-choices (e.g., leaving the specs, writing his own fortune) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The final act of stepping into the lighthouse crystallizes his renunciation of control, earned by decades of orchestrating others’ fates. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion flows through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradictions—his reverence for silence coexists with his sculpting of sound, and his calm masks urgent spiritual labor. His micro-choices (adjusting feedback, stepping to plumb resonance) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in intellectual humility and ritual precision. The possessed woman’s transformation feels earned because her voice emerges from the architecture Marcus builds, not imposed upon it. No diagnostic label-speak; even “assumption” is dramatized as a hollowed-out habit, not a clinical diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mei’s interiority is vividly embodied—her breath fogging glass, exhaustion creeping like frost—and her contradictions (longing for a “when,” not a place; conducting symphonies that exist only between heartbeats) drive every micro-choice. Her motivation—to give form to unheard melodies—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies under pressure. The final act of conducting the swirling fortunes feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her collapsing temporal perception. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion emerges through sensory action, not summary.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira’s contradictory impulses—desire to escape vs. need to integrate fractured selves—are embodied in her floating stance, clutching the tablet while resisting gravity. Her final choice to collapse timelines feels earned through visceral micro-choices (pressing the rune, accepting merging Kiras). No therapy-speak; emotions manifest through physicality (cold runes, dissolving bridge). The elderly Kira functions as a projection of self, not a separate character, preserving single-POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Lucia’s motivation—defeating emotional numbness through vibration—is embodied with visceral specificity, not abstraction. Her micro-choices (jerry-rigging the needle, placing palms on stone) reveal a hierarchy of values: connection over sound, sensation over hearing. Interior contradiction thrums beneath her actions—grief for lost music versus hunger for its physical echo—and culminates in an Earned Stasis that forecloses despair with tangible cost: accepting deafness as transformation, not loss. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in bone, teeth, and scar tissue.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s interiority is precise and embodied—her scientific rigor clashes with rising dread, revealed through micro-choices like shifting observation points and hidden record caches. Her motivation (integrity as resistance) intensifies credibly under pressure, culminating in a renunciation of passive observation for active preservation. The final decision carries visible cost: deeper isolation, heightened risk. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through tactile detail (warm message tube, spinning anemometer).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s aromatically cautious trait and grief-driven choices feel deeply embodied, not diagnostic. Her transformation is earned through micro-choices—uncorking the vial, recognizing her mother’s lanterns—that foreclose her old identity with palpable cost. Interior contradiction pulses in lines like “tears weren’t endings but translations,” avoiding tidy resolution. The final renunciation of passive brokering for active archiving crystallizes a hierarchy of values shaped by loss.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his poet’s hunger, moral tension, and tactile perception of time feel specific and consistent. His micro-choices (commanding the being, laying down the rope) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through sensory immersion (“taste in the grotto’s recycled air”). His final renunciation—leaving the rope—is earned by prior causality and reflects a credible endurance under accumulated moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s motivation—rooted in inherited perceptiveness and grief—is embodied through micro-choices (testing acoustics, lowering the violin at moonrise) that reveal a hierarchy of values: listening over performing, incompleteness over restoration. Her internal contradiction—longing for the lost forest yet creating something new—acts simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The final renunciation of polished music is earned by her grandmother’s teaching and the greenhouse’s acoustic logic, with visible cost in warped flutes and damaged accordions.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her static-charged hair, tactile interaction with amber, and emotional restraint reveal a character defined by professional discipline and private longing. Her renunciation of consuming the emotions (“never consume the merchandise”) is a micro-choice that crystallizes her moral code under pressure. The contradiction between her empathy and detachment feels lived-in, not diagnostic. Final endurance carries visible cost: she emerges bearing incomplete truths while denying herself wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot’s motivation—initially professional detachment, then quiet empathy—is rooted in consistent traits and deepens through micro-choices (e.g., convincing Captain Torres, introducing herself carefully to Martha). Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions are embodied (“fingers trembled,” “breath caught”). The final realization about “currencies beyond her careful calculations” emerges credibly from lived action, not epiphany. Her flaw—emotional reserve—complicates but doesn’t obstruct her arc, and the cost (time, emotional risk) is felt without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s motivation—rooted in a desire to graft herself into community through art—is embodied consistently in her actions and micro-choices, from weaving reeds to initiating the search. Her “boldly sympathetic certainty” feels earned, not performative, and drives relational change without flattening her into saviorism. The ancient artist’s arc complements Kira’s, revealing mutual need rather than one-sided rescue. However, secondary characters (Maria, Javi, Tomás) function more as thematic conduits than individuals with contradictory impulses under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s motivation is deeply rooted in inherited duty and empathy for trapped creatures, with micro-choices (completing illustrations) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her interiority is concrete—avoiding final details instinctively—and her emotional arc culminates in a renunciation of borrowed time that carries visible cost: the cracked pendant, the loss of temporal utility for the city. The story avoids diagnostic self-awareness; her realization emerges through action, not exposition. Flaws like her initial complicity in the system are confronted through earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Morrow’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “careful nature” directly shapes her methodical tracing of phosphorescent pigments and reverence for Elias’s cryptic legacy. Her final choice to leave the eyes demonstrates Earned Stasis: she accepts his transformation, foreclosing reunion but gaining understanding. The emotional contradiction—grief versus revelation—is threaded through tactile detail (velvet-wrapped eyes, chipped stone) rather than diagnostic labels. Her motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to communion, with visible cost in relinquishing physical recovery of her mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Edgar’s interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—his tactile memory of oxide coating, vacuum tubes, and his mother’s voice grounds his motivation in sensory history. His contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) act simultaneously when he gifts the light yet remains hidden. The archivist’s presence forces a micro-choice that reconfigures his self-concept without melodrama. Final renunciation of invisibility is earned through decades of quiet stewardship, with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s internal conflict—between scientific control and surrender to transformation—is rendered with embodied specificity (green-tinged nails, root-like veins) and credible emotional progression. His final choice to release control is earned through decades of study and his grandmother’s teachings, foreclosing his human identity with palpable cost. The micro-choice to loosen his grip on the leaf crystallizes his hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak; his transformation feels inevitable yet costly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s insomnia, grief, and artistic desperation fuse into a coherent, embodied drive; her micro-choices—gripping the brooch, tasting the water, deciding to paint the child—are weighted with exhaustion and purpose. The stranger’s restrained sorrow and sharp-edged smile reveal layered history without exposition. Both characters act from specific, contradictory impulses: Mara seeks meaning but clings to ancestral objects; the woman trades memory for closure. Their exchange feels inevitable yet costly, fulfilling Earned Stasis with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vera’s interiority is vividly rendered through embodied perception—her teeth aching from the pearl, her disorientation in the void—but her transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-choices under pressure. The pilgrim’s role remains functional rather than dynamically pressuring. Her flaw (overreliance on grand visions) credibly drives her blindness, and the renunciation of predictive certainty feels earned. However, the final shift lacks a visible cost beyond abstract loss, weakening emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kessa’s interiority is richly embodied—her tactile engagement with fragments, the valve, and light reveals a psyche shaped by exile and archival discipline. Her motivation (“compile fragments into meaning”) emerges organically from action, not exposition, and her final act of turning the valve crystallizes a renunciation of closure in favor of ongoing compilation. The sole minor flaw: Matthias’s brief presence risks flattening relational dynamics, but his function as foil remains cleanly subordinate to Kessa’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, cartographer’s precision, and artistic intuition cohere into a singular psyche. Her motivation grows organically from obsession to purpose, with micro-choices (stepping on the crack, using the punch) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation isn’t of truth but of daylight pretense, earned through escalating commitment. No diagnostic label-speak; her transformation feels lived, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s internal conflict—between empirical rigor and inherited mysticism—is rendered with precise, embodied contradiction. Her micro-choices (keeping the tile, transcribing whale songs) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The “entangled memories” feel lived-in, not expositional, and her final integration of skepticism and wonder is earned through specific, incremental shifts. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (“tile grew warmer,” “hands already moving”).

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vex’s interiority is vividly embodied—her weariness, longing for true death, and moral ambiguity feel earned through millennia of isolation. Her final choice to join Thorne arises from consistent motivation: immortality as prison, not gift. The micro-choice to thread magnetic fields reveals her hierarchy of values—curiosity over safety—with palpable cost. However, Thorne’s motives remain slightly under-embodied; his revolutionary fervor leans on exposition rather than contradictory impulses in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—honest yet complicit, loving yet burdened—embodied through precise micro-choices (stitching her father’s lips while negotiating restitution). Her moral struggle isn’t summarized but enacted via tactile ritual and dialogue that reveals hierarchy of values. Wei’s transformation from rage to trembling acceptance feels earned through Maya’s unwavering honesty, which destabilizes his inherited narrative. The final calculation—“subtracting his sins from her love”—resonates because it emerges from accumulated action, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The gilded-leaf stationer’s interiority is concrete and particular—her belief in trees’ memory, her reverence for erasure, her physical ache from writing—all embodied without diagnostic abstraction. Her micro-choices (positioning the lamp, charting hum modulations) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: fatigue, solitude, devotion to silenced truths. The monk’s silent presence deepens but doesn’t dilute her agency; their shared silence affirms mutual recognition of stakes. Final renunciation isn’t dramatic but earned: she closes the notepad, knowing her work is endless—a quiet endurance that forecloses completion with resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mari’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied perception—her grief as “fabric unraveling,” her navigation by echo—not therapy-speak. Her contradictory state (legally dead yet breathing) fuels micro-choices: signing three names, writing in pencil “light enough to be mistaken for shadows.” The poison label functions as both emotional compass and tangible proof of systemic failure, grounding her moral ambiguity in concrete detail. Her final act of inscription earns Charged Poise with visible cost: permanent alignment with the erased.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina and Claudia are vividly rendered through embodied contradiction—Marina’s myth-busting instinct versus her hummed participation, Claudia’s “cheerfully gloomy” bearing masking decades of grief. Their micro-choices (pressing the shell, drawing the bow) arise from specific emotional wounds, not abstract longing. The final renunciation—choosing to preserve rather than bust—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of embracing unresolved regret. Voice distinction in dialogue (“convenient relative appears…” vs. Marina’s silent processing) reinforces individuality without caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s dual allegiance and internal contradiction are embodied through tactile actions—pressing the stone chip, translating graffiti—and culminate in a credible renunciation of direct negotiation for cultural resistance. Her orderly intuition drives tactical choices (forging documents, legal repositioning) with visible cost: sacrificing personal ease for communal survival. The final image of her at the edge, holding knowledge of both worlds, crystallizes her enduring tension without tidy resolution. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats; emotion remains physical and conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile engagement with the hourglass, regolith, and camera reveals a hierarchy of values rooted in scientific reverence and poetic witness. Her “purposefully curious” trait drives micro-choices (e.g., descending into Tycho despite evacuation) that carry visible cost: isolation, obsolescence, and the burden of sole testimony. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action (“boots left prints that would last millennia”) and contradiction—she documents water as humanity abandons the Moon. Final renunciation (leaving the hourglass) is earned by three years of solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s blindness isn’t a limitation but a recalibration of perception—her micro-choices (e.g., pressure on the synthetic membrane) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in tactile precision and trust in non-visual feedback. Her calm competence never veers into infallibility; the cost is felt in her isolation and the weight of responsibility. Chen serves as effective pressure without overshadowing, and their dynamic subtly shifts from apprentice doubt to awe. Interiority is embodied through vibration, mist, and sound—not diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot’s dry wit, embodied curiosity, and internal conflict between professional duty and secret obsession drive every choice with specificity. Her micro-decisions—tracing dog-eared pages, interpreting falcon gestures, choosing to trust—are rooted in consistent traits and carry visible cost. The inspector’s arrival forces a crystallized stance that feels earned, not convenient. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, favoring concrete perception (“frost had formed asymmetric patterns”) over abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell tuner’s motivation is rooted in a quiet, consistent purpose—restoring harmony through rhythm—and her actions align precisely with this. Thomas serves as an effective secondary lens, showing transformation without overshadowing the protagonist. Interiority remains embodied (e.g., “kneeling by the fountain,” “pressing the fork to walls”), avoiding diagnostic labels. However, the bell tuner’s backstory and personal stakes remain opaque, limiting full emotional contradiction or cost beyond symbolic endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her scientific rigor wars with transcendent longing, and micro-choices (e.g., documenting instead of fleeing) reveal a hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation feels earned: not sudden epiphany but the culmination of spatial intuition, memory-triggered empathy, and professional identity. The vision of her daughter grounds her sacrifice in human specificity, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Flawlessly avoids stock crisis reactions; thought degrades believably under oxygen stress.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—truth-telling as inheritance and rebellion—is rooted in consistent, embodied traits (hovering, bare feet, journal obsession). His internal conflict between inherited shame and emergent agency manifests simultaneously: he both fears and seeks the lattice. The final renunciation (“My name is Marcus True-Tongue”) is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of exposure. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in scuffs, copper light, and hovering.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marlow’s interiority is richly embodied—his “mournful elation” captures the contradictory pull of love and toxicity. His micro-choices (not looking up, closing his hand around the bead) reveal a hierarchy of values forged across generations. The ghost bride’s agency is equally compelling: her final renunciation reframes centuries of haunting as protection, not possession. Both characters feel individually textured, never archetypal, and their flaws directly shape the story’s earned liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Calla’s motivation—transforming ruin into reverence through stitching—is embodied in every action and anchored in her past as a poet. Her internal contradiction (grief vs. creation) operates simultaneously, not as alternating states. The final renunciation of restoration for transformation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the drowned world she cannot reclaim. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions manifest through tactile, sensory detail like “fingers still moving in phantom stitches.”

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Miriam’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling fingers, conflicted return, and shifting perception of faith feel specific and earned. Her micro-choices (kneeling to clear soil, accepting the gnomon) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: surrendering rootless survival for rooted purpose. Yakov’s warmth applies subtle pressure without overshadowing her arc. The final act—rebuilding not just stone but meaning—emerges organically from her grandmother’s legacy and dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her chalk choices, inherited clipboard, and ritualized process reveal a psyche shaped by loss, craft, and quiet rebellion. Her motivation (to forge true pseudonyms from marginal truths) intensifies through micro-choices: selecting turquoise for flow, amber for memory, photographing with analog film. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges via tactile detail (“colored dust on the marble”) and professional ethos. Her final smile isn’t triumph but earned poise—cost felt in transience (rain will wash the code) and legacy (vaulted film).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s contradictory impulses—performing senility while executing precise espionage—are embodied in every micro-choice, from drool to blood-coded embroidery. Her wisdom-as-foolishness disguise isn’t stated but enacted with visceral cost (social erasure, constant performance). Motivation intensifies under pressure without lapsing into diagnostic self-awareness. The final smile is earned by months of encoded listening, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The medium’s interior conflict—between protective silence and maternal longing—is embodied in tactile detail (“scars healed,” “unsent letters carved into her soul”) and culminates in a confession that feels earned, not diagnostic. Her micro-choice to press the shard against the third window crystallizes years of avoidance into action. The flaw of emotional self-awareness (“I was protecting myself, not you”) avoids therapy-speak by emerging as disembodied truth in the ritual space. Marina’s off-page presence exerts credible pressure through memory and spirit-song, making their relationship the crucible of change.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “lotus-hearted ache,” phantom pains, and morphine-loosened honesty reveal layered guilt, grief, and purpose without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (offering the coral, drawing the bridge) stem credibly from her history as a translator and survivor. The child’s shrewd innocence pressures Maya into vulnerable honesty, crystallizing her renunciation of grand diplomacy for intimate healing. Final gesture—giving away the coral—is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile connection to the fresco, her laughter as a rediscovered act, and her emotional arc from dampened sorrow to pensive mirth feel earned. Her motivation—to restore joy through light-painting—is consistent and intensifies organically. However, her transformation lacks a clear contradictory impulse in-scene; she moves fluidly from memory to action without internal friction that would elevate this to 9+. The final choice (to keep searching) is credible but not costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s interior contradiction—methodical restorer versus emergent playfulness—is embodied in tactile choices (flipping the coin, pressing it to the mural) and crystallizes in her final renunciation of certainty. Her micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: sealing away magic she could claim. Marcus functions effectively as secondary pressure without diluting focus. The voice remains consistent, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness even amid metaphysical revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus and Serena feel fully individuated—his quiet precision contrasts her roguish charm, yet both share a deep commitment to defiance through cultivation. Their micro-choices (releasing specific insects, pocketing the seed) reveal consistent values under pressure. Interiority is embodied (“beetles responded to his sudden tension”) rather than abstract. The final renunciation—Marcus staying to face Auditors while Serena plants rebellion—earns its cost through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The insomniac poet’s interiority is richly embodied through tactile rituals (charcoal from failed poems, cracked lullabies) and sustained contradiction—shyness versus unstoppable influence. Her motivation to transform pain into beauty arises organically from war trauma and is tested across centuries, culminating in earned endurance rather than victory. However, the absence of on-page secondary characters limits relational crucible dynamics, and her “flaws” lean toward poetic archetype over individuated struggle. Still, micro-choices (burning poems, teaching lullabies) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values with visible cost: perpetual insomnia as both burden and creative engine.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her “gently systematic” movements, tactile rituals, and emotional restraint reveal a character shaped by loss and devotion. Her motivation (preserving forgotten names) intensifies under pressure when the chime sings her grandmother’s name, compelling urgent action. The contradiction between disciplined calm and desperate hope pulses through every micro-choice, especially as she races to capture the sound before the bamboo splits. Her final act—whispering “Solmieth” into the orchid—is earned, costly, and crystallizes her life’s purpose without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, nervous laughter, and “carefully reckless” approach reveal a complex hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation (to restore trust via linguistic truth) intensifies credibly, culminating in a renunciation of scholarly caution for urgent action. The mentor’s warning and her awareness of catastrophic stakes ground her choices in consistent traits without safety-hedging. Her final decision carries visible cost: risking war if she errs, yet the story avoids diagnostic label-speak even at peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—she trembles not from fear but from recognizing the “elegant cruelty and kindness” of her plan. Her micro-choices (carving plans both sides will misread, designing dual-operation floodgates) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in intergenerational wisdom. The surveyor’s chain embodies four generations of women who “measured hearts disguised as land,” grounding her motivation in legacy without exposition. Her flaw—slyly manipulating others into reconciliation—is fully integrated into her competence, making the resolution feel earned rather than saintly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trauma, suspicion, and tentative healing manifest through tactile interactions with paper, dust, and the meteorite. Her contradictory impulses (destruction vs. preservation, flight vs. rootedness) operate simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice—to accept her dual identity—is earned by prior micro-choices (burning clippings, reorganizing letters) and carries the felt cost of enduring public disgrace while claiming private truth. Theodore’s late revelation reframes but doesn’t override her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marina’s motivation—rooted in grief, inherited perception, and a daughter’s love—is rendered with embodied specificity (e.g., “seven feet between planted rows, matching the exact span of her father's arms”). Her internal contradiction (seeking closure vs. inhabiting liminal space) acts simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final choice to draw her own codes is earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of accepting perpetual threshold existence. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile memory and weather logic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied emotion (“fingers tracing constellations in the condensation”) and a clear hierarchy of values revealed through her quiet observation versus Chen’s instrumentation. Her “softly ingenious” approach manifests in micro-choices—waiting, watching—that contrast with institutional methods, yet her motivation lacks a visible trade-off or cost that tightens under pressure. The final realization feels earned but leans slightly toward epiphany without a prior contradictory impulse acting in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sea-foam recollectionist embodies a compelling interior contradiction—cheerful yet burdened, hopeful yet resigned—that manifests in embodied micro-choices (kneeling by the sprout, careful handling of glass). Her motivation is consistent and deepened through tactile interaction with emotional fossils, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (“paths just changed form”) feels earned by her lived engagement with fragments, not abstract musing. Her flaw—collecting what cannot be reassembled—is woven into every action, making her endurance poignant and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and specific—his “calculated wilderness” mindset manifests through micro-choices like seeding coins or adjusting repertoire for audience types. His flaw (control masked as generosity) drives authentic tension, especially in the teenager interaction, where his improvisation reveals vulnerability beneath engineering. The final renunciation—accepting impermanence as the tide erases his stage—is earned by prior causality and carries conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in gesture, rhythm, and object handling.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation—transforming exile into artistry—is rooted in consistent traits and intensifies credibly under pressure. Her interiority is concrete (“loneliness threatened to unmoor her”), embodied (“bare feet finding purchase”), and free of diagnostic label-speak. The final renunciation (accepting capture to seed rebellion) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: her imminent arrest. Contradictory impulses—solitude vs. legacy, memory vs. erasure—act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and character-specific: his glazier’s eye for stress fractures becomes a metaphor for reading life’s hidden patterns. His contradictory impulses—resignation versus preservation—act simultaneously in the stone-throwing ritual. The final choice to document rather than resist demolition feels earned through prior micro-choices (e.g., pocketing the stone, observing ripples). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are embodied in tactile attention to glass, water, light.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—his guilt over the rookie’s death clashes with his hard-won expertise, embodied in scarred hands that tremble before a fragile box. His final decision to record a message reveals a hierarchy of values: protecting others’ innocence outweighs preserving his own silence. The old woman’s off-page presence exerts pressure through memory, not dialogue, avoiding headcount bloat. His epiphany feels earned because it emerges from tactile engagement with the box, not abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The seer’s interiority is vividly embodied—her silver-blind eyes, soil-memory in her hands, and the ache of lost identity feel specific and earned. Her contradictory impulses (prophecy vs. gardening, remembering vs. forgetting) operate simultaneously in key moments, especially when she kneels in the soil. The final choice to plant—not seek visions—is rooted in decades of accumulated loss, with visible cost: relinquishing her oracle identity. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile sensation and micro-choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kaspar’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and morally complex—his guilt over teaching the “wrong defense” manifests through tactile habits (fidgeting with copper pieces) and perceptual distortion (seeing his student in the platinum queen). His final act of self-forgiveness avoids diagnostic label-speak and emerges from sustained micro-choices: decoding threads, adjusting the tapestry, placing the offering. The contradiction between his desire to undo the past and his growing acceptance is active throughout, not summarized. His flaw—overvaluing victory over wisdom—is credibly tied to both his past failure and present redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira’s motivation—rooted in childhood discovery and artistic defiance—is consistent, embodied, and escalates credibly to high-stakes action. Her internal contradiction (defiance vs. hope for forgiveness) operates simultaneously in key moments, not as alternating summaries. The final renunciation of silence is earned through micro-choices (whispering verse, climbing spires) with visible cost: she forfeits survival for multiplicity of truth. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are tactile (“chill seep through her skin”) and worldview-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, acid-burned throat, and desperate narration reveal a psyche shaped by grief, guilt, and stubborn hope. Her micro-choices (pressing the charm, holding position as the workshop tilts) align with her motivation to preserve meaning. The final smile isn’t unearned epiphany but the culmination of her alchemical ethos: beauty through brokenness. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile, sensory immediacy under extreme duress.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “tender and distant” handling of paints mirrors her emotional stance, and her contradictory impulses (longing for connection vs. protective aloofness) act simultaneously. Her final choice to paint in the cave feels earned by decades of unconscious inheritance, not epiphany. The grandmother’s journal reveals motivation without over-explaining, preserving mystery while deepening character logic. Flaws are consistent: Marina’s detachment costs her ordinary intimacy but enables her art.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling fingers, screaming tenderness, and tactile memory of Thomas reveal a psyche shaped by grief, love, and guilt.

The contradiction between her longing and her need to release him drives every action. Thomas’s limited but potent presence as shimmering essence avoids sentimentality while deepening emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, moon-tied strength, and voice breaking mid-call reveal contradiction and cost without diagnostic labels. Her renunciation of joining the reverse migration is earned through accumulated micro-choices (cranking the array, lying to a child) that foreclose personal salvation. The censer foot functions as both emotional anchor and physical lever, tying memory to present action. Final endurance carries raw, visible sacrifice: stiff fingers, new scratches on bronze, and the admission “some of us are meant to stay.”

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her compulsive truth-telling manifests in raw, specific confessions that reveal psychological torment without therapy-speak. Her contradictory impulses (desire for relief vs. fear of deception’s return) act simultaneously in the climax. The final choice to rebuild with discretion—not lies—is earned through prior suffering and concrete action (preparing and ingesting the cure). Cost is felt in her isolation and shattered relationships, making her renunciation of compulsion psychologically credible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Magnus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his salt-cracked palm, the tactile resistance of the boutonniere, his pulse-timed observation—all revealing a man shaped by solitude and inherited sorrow. His contradictory impulses (longing for connection vs. resigned isolation) act simultaneously during the dock investigation. The final choice to re-pin the Edelweiss isn’t just acceptance but reclamation, earned by prior causality with palpable emotional cost. The son’s off-page presence intensifies Magnus’s arc without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tactile intuition, regret over unlived lives, and quiet transformation feel earned. His final choice isn’t tidy but resonant: he steps into agency without discarding his past. The matrix chip and ants function as externalized manifestations of internal contradiction, not symbols. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of passive expertise for uncertain action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Seraphina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her disenchantment, rage, and resignation feel specific and contradictory, not diagnostic. Her final renunciation (“What if I refuse?”) crystallizes a hierarchy of values with irreversible cost. The firefly transformation emerges organically from inherited trauma, not epiphany. Flaws drive inevitability: her lineage’s pride compels the climb even as she resents its burden.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lyra’s interiority is precise and embodied—her struggle between scientific rigor and emotional memory manifests in tactile choices (clutching the shell, withdrawing her hand). Marcus functions as both mirror and catalyst, his dialogue revealing Lyra’s blind spots without exposition. The final micro-choice—to adjust calibrations “not to trap but to echo”—is earned through prior contradictions and carries the cost of abandoning her grandmother’s method. No diagnostic label-speak; epiphany arises from action, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trembling hands, bark-like laugh, and forehead against cold glass convey layered emotion without diagnostic labels. Her contradictory impulses (longing for linear time vs. accepting chaos) act simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final micro-choice—to step outside and “begin by falling”—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of perpetual uncertainty. No safety-hedging; her flaw (over-documentation) directly enables her entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her loss of smell refracts into tactile perception, guiding her repair work with emotional precision. Her micro-choices (e.g., deliberately leaving the screw loose) reveal a hierarchy of values: honoring grief over mechanical perfection. Mrs. Huang’s trembling hands and dissolved sentence feel authentic, not performative. Their interaction avoids therapy-speak; emotions arise through gesture, object, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira’s crystallizing skin flaw is embodied with visceral specificity, driving her internal conflict and culminating in a micro-choice—tracing her scars as a rune—that transforms shame into strength. Her motivation intensifies organically from scholarly pressure to existential revelation, rooted in consistent traits. The grandmother’s rhyme reframes backstory as active catalyst, not passive memory, and Kira’s oxygen-starved desperation feels physically and emotionally credible. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion emerges through action, sensation, and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s internal contradiction—between her reductive exorcist identity and dawning recognition of nuanced spiritual collaboration—is embodied in micro-choices (taking the perfume, transcribing notes) and culminates in a renunciation of her past certainty with tangible cost: her professional narrative must now accommodate ambiguity. Marcus and Elisabetta function as a fused crucible that forces Vera’s recalibration without flattening either into foil. The flaw of diagnostic overconfidence is dramatized through prior action (“torn Elisabetta from Marcus like removing a tumor”) and paid for in present humility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.3)
    Kaia’s interiority is vividly embodied—her contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release, witness vs. act) manifest physically through her handling of the dictionary and navigation of the library. Her final choice to place the book on the pedestal feels earned by seventeen prior iterations, each reinforcing her role as both observer and participant. The cost—eternal recurrence of forgetting/remembering—is legible in her laugh that “contained all sounds and no sound.” No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied—her tactile relationship with the key, the ritualized counting, and her grandmother’s whispered wisdom fuse motive, memory, and action. Her contradiction (mechanical precision vs. fluid time) operates simultaneously in scene, not as alternating summaries. The final realization feels earned through micro-choices (counting backward, recording the horizon) that reconfigure her understanding with tangible cost: she tends systems that no longer exist, yet persists. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through sensory detail and constrained action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s internal conflict—between professional rigidity and emotional vulnerability—is embodied through micro-choices (e.g., hesitating before calling Chen) and grounded in specific sensory detail. Her spatial gift and laser use feel integral, not ornamental. However, the epiphany about “physics of letting go” leans slightly toward diagnostic phrasing (“security doesn’t mean isolation”), risking over-articulation in a peak beat. The change is earned, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elena’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, intellectual rigor, and inherited compulsion intertwine without therapy-speak. Her final choice to write a cryptic message emerges organically from her contradictions, with visible cost in relinquishing the illusion of mathematical purity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marcus’s interiority is richly embodied—his ritual with the glass disc, his quiet complicity in Eleanor’s fiction, and his renunciation of ordinary connection feel lived-in and specific. His motivation (to teach “productive disconnection”) emerges through action, not exposition. The flaw: Eleanor’s arc leans slightly on diagnostic phrasing (“melodically haunted,” “deep place where truth and comfort negotiate”), risking label-speak in a pivotal beat. Still, his final endurance—choosing this liminal role—is earned and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction—her reverence for archival truth wars with her compassion for Eleanor, culminating in the micro-choice to embed hidden testimony.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion lives in sensory detail (“haunted euphoria,” “papery hands trembling”).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sadie’s “desperately jocular” voice is embodied in action and dialogue, revealing layered contradictions—her performative charm masks deep purpose, and her micro-choices (e.g., correcting coffee origin while accepting the thermos) reveal precise status calibration. Marcus’s quiet yearning is rendered through concrete gestures (thermos as peace offering, hesitation with the phone), avoiding exposition. Their dynamic crystallizes a relationship-as-crucible: Sadie catalyzes his shift from isolation to agency, and his choice to accept the phone forecloses passive observation with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s motivation—mapping unspoken grief—is embodied through tactile, sensory actions and deepens credibly as she absorbs languages via skin. Her blindness is not a deficit but a recalibration of perception, consistently shaping her choices. The final transformation (“become the destination”) emerges organically from prior causality, with the cost being the surrender of conventional navigation for soul-deep cartography. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through ultrasonic resonance, moss dialects, and vibrating platinum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her guilt over the colonial fleet, her tactile reliance on the pen, and her “confident uncertainty” feel lived-in, not diagnostic. Her contradictory impulses (saving lives vs. preserving discovery) collide in the climax without tidy resolution. The dried pen functions as both emotional anchor and moral compass, grounding her choice in character history. Her final decision reflects earned wisdom, not epiphany, with clear cost: accepting ambiguity over salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s arthritic joints, silent photography ritual, and fraught history with music reveal layered interiority without exposition. Her micro-choices—clicking an empty camera, sharing her notebook—embody contradictory impulses: the desire to create versus the fear of irrelevance. Chen functions as both mirror and catalyst, her presence forcing Maya to confront memory and silence. The final renunciation (“silence felt like a beginning”) is earned through decades of loss made tactile in gesture and gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation is deeply rooted in ancestral legacy and personal compulsion, with interiority rendered through embodied perception (“dreams had always tasted of smoke,” “volcanic tenderness”). Her contradictory impulses—destruction as preservation—are active in-scene and culminate in a renunciation of anonymity for custodianship. The final choice to memorize the pattern feels earned by her forensic sensitivity and genetic memory, with visible cost: she remains alone, branded a terrorist, yet embraces her role. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise from tactile engagement with fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her rebellion through drumming, her awareness of bodily dissolution, and her final renunciation are all rendered with concrete specificity.

The cost is legible in her physical surrender, yet her defiance persists beyond death. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summarizing mars her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is embodied through gait, maps, and tactile rituals; his contradiction—competence vs. institutional invisibility—fuels every choice. Chen’s panic and eventual deference reveal a credible status shift earned by Marcus’s quiet authority. The zodiac coin and whispered reports crystallize his motivation without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (“Keep it”) carries visible cost: he relinquishes his talisman to seed systemic change.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s silent empathy and Thomas’s frozen grief are embodied with precision—her spiraling calm contrasts his hunched tension, and their micro-choices (mirror handling, shutter manipulation) reveal values without exposition. The boy’s emotional shift feels earned through sensory engagement rather than therapy-speak. One flaw: Mira borders on archetype, though her actions ground her. Final renunciation of silence-as-dogma is credible and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s motivation—planting “forests of second thoughts”—is rooted in consistent, embodied resistance, and his flaw (overconfidence in secrecy) compounds under pressure. Elena’s silent desire to “learn to think” is rendered with emotional specificity, not therapy-speak. Their micro-choices (pawn moves, synchronized displays) reveal hierarchies of value with visible cost: exposure, paternal opposition, institutional threat. The final renunciation—teaching overthrow as intellectual liberation—is earned by prior causality and charged with societal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interior conflict—performing masculinity for survival in a world that no longer requires it—is embodied with visceral specificity, especially in the moonlit unwrapping scene. Torven’s shift from aggression to vulnerability feels earned through micro-choices (his softened demand, cracked hardness). Both characters’ contradictions act simultaneously: Mira’s fear and yearning, Torven’s pride and loneliness. The final recognition (“You’re magnificent”) avoids sentimentality by anchoring awe in mutual authenticity, not desire.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    The performer’s blank affect and Mrs. Chen’s brittle grief are embodied with precision, not explained. Their micro-choices—accepting the bouquet, narrating whittling—reveal hierarchies of value under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silas’s interiority is vividly embodied—his tremor of certainty, bone-deep memory of exile, and conflicted reverence for the Order feel specific and non-diagnostic. His motivation (to rewrite reality through cloud-shadow poetry) intensifies credibly as he moves, culminating in a renunciation not of form but of rigidity. The final choice—to dance with others, transforming rather than destroying—is earned by his history and the lifted ban. However, the collective entrance of other poets slightly dilutes the singularity of his arc, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s colorblindness isn’t a gimmick but a lens that drives perception, choice, and thematic insight—her micro-choices (arranging herbs, reading Enzo’s tremor) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible emotional cost. Enzo’s grief and artistic paralysis are embodied, not summarized; his shift from guarded barter to vulnerable plea feels earned. Their relationship crystallizes under pressure without sentimentality, and the daughter’s return lands as consequence, not convenience. The only near-slip: Enzo’s sudden openness borders on rapid, but Mira’s precise floral “reading” justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Vera’s interiority is richly embodied—her doubt, grief, and dawning agency emerge through tactile gestures (the lens, bell-striking) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (improvising the sequence, pocketing the lens post-performance) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: abandoning ritual for authenticity. The grandmother’s miner backstory isn’t exposition but a lived filter shaping Vera’s perception and action. No safety-hedging; her flaw (deference to tradition) directly complicates her arc until she renounces it.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elena’s grief is embodied with precision—trembling hands stilled by craft, folded cranes as ritual—and her internal contradiction (desire to transform vs. fear of permanence) manifests in tactile choices. The phoenix tattoo hesitation and origami coordinates reveal a hierarchy of values where helping others precedes self-healing. Her micro-choice to finally sterilize the needle signals earned readiness, not epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action, tool, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied through her tools and methods—onyx ink, algorithmic tape—and her micro-choices (e.g., correcting Marcus’s “next month” to “forty-three days”) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in inherited practice. Her steadily curious nature drives tangible action, not just observation. Marcus functions effectively as secondary pressure, his academic skepticism sharpening Vera’s revelations without overshadowing her agency. Flaws are implicit in her isolation and esoteric methodology, but the story wisely avoids over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mira’s motivation is crystalline—her seventeen-year preparation, chaotic movement, and ultimate sacrifice arise from a coherent, embodied philosophy of unpredictability as resistance. Her internal conflict (preservation vs. purification) manifests physically in trembling fingers, erratic steps, and convulsive transformation. The final act—a willing absorption of trauma—is earned by every prior choice, with visible cost: her identity fragmented, her body repurposed as a filter. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is rendered through sensory invasion (“foreign memories,” “tears... not her tears”).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, curiosity, and resolve are filtered through tactile details (the river stone, prismatic light) rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choices (activating the interface, transcribing the vision) reveal a hierarchy of values: preserving intergenerational hope over institutional skepticism. The final renunciation—accepting her role as tender of waiting dreams—is earned by decades of quiet observation and familial legacy. No head-hopping or knowledge leaps; her emotional arc remains tightly bound to sensory cues and causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trembling fingers, surgical focus, and whispered confession reveal layered self-deception without diagnostic label-speak. Her micro-choices (removing chips, reattaching the tail, drafting the confession) align with a credible moral unraveling. The final renunciation of spectacle for truth is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost: sanctuary closure, public shame, legal consequence. Her flaw—using another’s suffering to stave off her own ruin—is consistent, unflinching, and never safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Maya’s motivation—reading scars as libraries—is embodied through micro-choices (tracing coffee rings, pressing palm to glass) and consistent internal contradiction: reopening wounds not for closure but to create channels for grace. Her accidental telepathy with plants arises organically from surgery, never feels diagnostic, and her emotional state degrades believably under anesthesia’s fade. The final turn—accepting wounds as invitations—is earned by prior causality and carries the cost of perpetual openness.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s interiority is vividly embodied—her psychometric gift manifests through tactile, sensory immersion rather than diagnostic labels. Her micro-choice to steal the film strip crystallizes her moral stance with visible cost: professional betrayal for emotional fidelity. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. reverence) act simultaneously in scene, especially when she sways under “forgotten lyrics.” The final renunciation—carrying secrets like seeds—is earned by prior accumulation of emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyra’s motivation—freeing trapped creativity—is consistent and intensifies through her obsessive star-tracing, culminating in a credible renunciation of earthly existence. Her interiority is vividly embodied (“ice crystals formed on her eyelashes,” “felt herself fragmenting”) and avoids diagnostic labels. The flaw lies in the lack of contradictory impulses; she moves with near-ritual certainty, reducing emotional friction. Still, her final choice feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost: dissolution into stardust.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kess’s motivation—cultivating sparks for dreamless children—is embodied in her lullaby, micro-choices (singing to collapse wave functions), and refusal to yield the nightmare container. Her internal contradiction (dreamless yet nurturing dreams) operates simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The frozen chess clock ties her past trauma to present agency without therapy-speak. Final renunciation (“necessary” vs. “impossible”) is earned through consistent quantum-charming tactics with visible cost: perpetual liminality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Stray Philosopher’s interiority is vividly embodied through tactile perception (the gear humming, steam hissing) and micro-choices (pressing the gear to his ear, placing it in the Loom Tree). His motivation—to recover untamed thought—is dramatized through action, not summary. However, his internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; he moves from amnesiac wanderer to lucid architect without visible struggle or competing impulses during key beats. The epiphany feels earned but slightly frictionless, missing the grit of genuine cognitive dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s interiority is vividly embodied—her regret over the leash, her hoarse voice, her tactile discovery of the blank ticket—all reveal a character defined by suppressed courage. Her final micro-choice to release the leash (figuratively and literally) emerges organically from accumulated pressure, not epiphany.

No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete sensation and action.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—numb fingers tingle with phantom pain while he clings to a bolt as talisman; his endurance isn’t passive but charged with guilt and duty. Elena’s return reveals her own renunciation-turned-reclamation, her whispered voice embodying the cost of silence. Their micro-choices (kneeling on the step, handing over the bolt) reveal hierarchies of value under pressure. Both characters avoid diagnostic self-awareness, instead showing emotional complexity through gesture and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)

Her motivation intensifies credibly from archival curiosity to urgent revelation, culminating in the decision to dive. The final choice feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost (abandoning station protocol) and lineage (echoing her grandmother’s witness role). No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions surface through gesture, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kira’s “awkward confidence” manifests in embodied gestures—bare feet gripping steel, off-balance grace—that evolve into fluid certainty by the climax. Her motivation (to find meaning in rebellion’s aftermath) is consistent and deepened through micro-choices: using opera glasses, stepping into the stone circle, deciding to return with others. The interior contradiction—between exhaustion and hope—is sustained without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)

Her internal contradiction (reverence for memory vs. necessity of change) plays out in scene without summary. The final renunciation of preservation-as-stasis (“not by preserving it in amber but by releasing it”) is earned through consistent causality and carries conceptual cost. Flawless interiority filtered through botanical consciousness avoids diagnostic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Amira’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her trauma manifests through somatic markers, pruning gestures, and tactile communion with plants, avoiding diagnostic abstraction. Her quiet talent emerges organically from loss, not as a trope but as a recalibrated nervous system. The photograph and sister’s memory fuel micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values: cultivation over collapse. Final renunciation isn’t escape but alignment with indifferent, persistent life—a credible endurance with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marina’s internal contradiction—between her need to capture truth and her terror of fractured reality—is embodied in precise, sensory detail ("fingers trembled," "charcoal from the lighthouse's long-dead beacon fire"). Her micro-choices (sketching on tarot cards, laughing with “grief for her old way of seeing”) reveal a hierarchy of values: truth over convention, fragmentation over false wholeness. No diagnostic label-speak; her epiphany emerges from tactile action, not abstraction. The final portrait across cards earns her transformation through consistent struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The albino tracker’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “serene anger,” scientific rigor, and intuitive wildness manifest through micro-choices like deliberate ink-spilling and encampment layout. Her motivation (understanding temporal distortion in crisis) is consistent and deepened by the Tibet avalanche memory, which anchors her obsession without over-explaining. The final shift from anger to understanding feels earned, not epiphanic, and her flaws (isolation, intensity) carry implicit cost. However, her transformation leans slightly toward conceptual clarity over visceral emotional reconfiguration, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Vera’s internal conflict—between archivist oath and truth-teller duty—is embodied in precise, contradictory micro-choices (e.g., initiating the upload while knowing security arrives in four minutes).

The final smile carries “terrible peace,” credibly earned by her Damascus backstory and Marcus’s letter. No safety-hedging: she accepts irreversible cost without illusion of redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her pacifism coexists with inherited vigilance, embodied in tactile rituals and micro-choices like refusing to hurry when her father arrives. Her father’s transformation is subtly earned through physical hesitation (sheathing his weapon “with the deliberate care of someone learning a new language”) rather than epiphany. Their relationship functions as crucible: opposing worldviews stabilize rather than fracture them, culminating in shared planting that reconfigures their dynamic without erasing tension. Flaws are integrated—her “senseless perception” borders on impractical idealism, his violence carries hollow exhaustion—not safety-hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kova’s interiority is vividly embodied—her steady breath, hammering heart, and silent vocalizations reveal contradiction without diagnostic labels.

Minor deduction for Dr. Kepler’s underdeveloped presence, though his role is functional.

Her final resolve feels earned, not declared.

Their reunion avoids sentimentality by grounding emotion in concrete, character-particular sensations (strawberries, silver, cinnamon). The final hand-hold crystallizes decades of longing without diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s interiority is vividly embodied through somatic markers and micro-choices that feel specific and consistent; her contradictions—between scientific curiosity and bodily intuition—are dramatized in action, not summarized. David functions effectively as both emotional anchor and pressure source, his skepticism evolving credibly into participatory wonder. However, his transformation lacks a decisive micro-choice that alters their dynamic beyond passive acceptance, slightly undercutting the “relationships as crucible” test for full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kira’s motivation—to become the voice of the unknown—is compellingly embodied through micro-choices (e.g., pressing the fossil to her chest, adjusting her harness) that reveal a hierarchy of values. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels and remains concrete (“fingertips that could taste temperature variations”). However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; she moves cleanly from observer to translator without resisting the cost of that shift. The final renunciation—letting the fossil crumble—is earned but arrives with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “quietly inspired” reaction to the canyon echo and her shift from preservation to creation feel earned through tactile engagement with buttons and sand. Her micro-choices (matching button to hourglass, arranging the spiral) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on possibility over fixed fate.

    Thomas’s interiority is concrete and particular—his decades-long ritual, his ambient awareness, his quiet competence—all embodied through micro-choices (e.g., needle tucked behind ear, stillness while waiting). The woman’s grief is shown through physical cues (“tears mixing with the mist”) and subtext, not exposition. Their brief interaction reveals a hierarchy of values: he offers not erasure but distillation, honoring the cost of broken trust. Both characters feel singular, flawed, and fully realized within tight scope.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mei’s interiority is vividly embodied—her potter’s precision informs every movement, and her motivation (to understand temporal resilience) emerges organically from tactile memory. The contradiction between her restless seeking and patient observation fuels micro-choices (e.g., unwrapping the glass only when thrumming intensifies). Her epiphany about kindness as a temporal anchor feels earned, not diagnostic, and the final renunciation (walking away) carries visible cost: she leaves behind the very harmony she sought to replicate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marina’s motivation is rooted in generational continuity and quiet community care, embodied through tactile interactions with soil, tools, and neighbors.

    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her contradiction between secret-keeping and yearning for connection manifests in tactile choices (handling the thrush’s nest, threading glass slides). Chen’s return forces micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: art over confession, pattern over privacy. Their shared history surfaces through subtext, not exposition, and his quiet admission (“I kept your letters”) reconfigures their dynamic without melodrama. The final hand-hold earns its emotional weight because both characters’ flaws—Mira’s guardedness, Chen’s initial judgment—have been dramatized, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent—her expertise, isolation, and cautious hope drive her actions under pressure.

    Elara’s interiority is vividly embodied—her “spongey dread,” tactile handling of the nail, and wavering certainty feel specific and human. Her motivation stems credibly from ancestral legacy, not abstract idealism, and her final broadcast is a micro-choice that crystallizes inherited duty with visible cost. The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through action (“clutched the copper nail tighter”) rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marla’s interiority is vividly embodied—her grief, regret, and musical intuition manifest through tactile detail (“bow trembling,” “worn wood warm against her chin”). Her contradictory impulses (judgment vs. mercy) act simultaneously in scene, not as abstract reflections.

    Kael’s interiority is vividly embodied—his “warlike serenity,” tactile perception of the seed, and moral tension between honor and necessity feel specific and unforced. His micro-choices (diving into the lake, pressing amber to ice) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost: his order’s survival versus ancestral reputation. The ancestor’s sacrifice reframes Kael’s flaw—not weakness but inherited burden—and his final resolve avoids epiphany in favor of earned endurance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through action and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)

His contradictory impulses—desire to reject his duplicate versus yearning for feeling—play out in real time during the sparring scene.

Her motivation—to discover the “texture of connection”—is dramatized through micro-choices (testing thread, pausing to observe eruptions) that escalate under pressure. However, her transformation lacks a decisive renunciation or cost; she exits unchanged except by completion, missing a legible emotional or existential price.

Interiority is concrete (“Gran teaching her to read tide charts”) and avoids diagnostic self-awareness. However, the emotional shift from curiosity to burdened custodian lacks a visible internal struggle during the climax—acceptance feels slightly too seamless for full 9+.

Their micro-choices (Kess lunging, Elara halting her; both annotating together) reveal hierarchies of value with tangible cost. Voice distinction is sharp: Kess’s clipped snaps contrast Elara’s rust-on-iron cadence. The final shift—Kess seeing Elara’s deeper purpose—is earned through embodied teaching, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Merrick and the child are rendered with precise interiority and embodied emotion—her grief isn’t stated but shown through the photograph of her grandfather mid-sentence, and Merrick’s transformation from vendor to guardian is earned through micro-choices (selecting “sharp incisors,” using moonlight as guide). Their motivations intertwine without sentimentality, and the child’s request—to unknow endings—is psychologically credible for a child processing loss.

The merchant’s brief but pressure-filled presence crystallizes Korin’s moral stance without head-hopping or abstraction.

The story avoids diagnostic label-speak; emotions arise through tactile detail (e.g., “trembling hands,” “lonesome splendor”). However, Marcus’s transformation leans slightly toward epiphany without sufficient micro-resistance, costing a half-point.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s motivation is rooted in ancestral duty and visceral connection to sound, embodied through trembling hands and bone-deep resonance. Her internal conflict—between fear and obligation—is rendered through concrete physiological detail (“teeth ache,” “heart skip”) rather than abstraction. The final choice to become sound itself is earned by prior causality: her grandmother’s teachings, the artifact’s call, and the Collectors’ approach. Cost is visible in the melted key and abandoned coat—proof of irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira’s motivation is deeply rooted in generational resistance and personal obsession, embodied through tactile rituals (meteorite instruments, copper rods) and internal tension between wildness and discipline.

Tomás functions as pressure, not ornament, reinforcing stakes without diluting focus. The final renunciation of loud revolution for glacial change feels earned by every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.2)
    Margot’s interiority is vividly embodied—her trembling hands, empirical instincts clashing with inherited memories—and her final choice to resign feels earned by layered contradictions: observer vs. participant, protocol vs. compassion. The lantern-triggered visions avoid diagnostic label-speak by grounding epiphanies in sensory flood (“memories that weren’t hers flooding through her consciousness like the rain”). Her transformation from detached investigator to active liberator carries visible cost: abandoning institutional authority for uncertain, soul-driven work. Flawlessly integrates backstory (grandmother’s 1962 rescue) as present-moment catalyst without flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Eliza and Marcus are rendered with precise interiority and embodied contradiction—her grief layered with inherited grace, his quiet persistence rooted in vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Pioneer’s yearning algorithm and “steadily curious” nature manifest as embodied, contradictory impulses—she tinkers obsessively while ignoring social doubt, her ambition fused with intellectual hunger. Her final transformation feels earned: each micro-choice (adjusting lenses, etching wings) reflects escalating commitment with visible cost (isolation, risk of dissolution). Sprocket provides just enough relational pressure without diluting focus. No diagnostic label-speak; interiority remains concrete through brass wings, copper veins, and kaleidoscopic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)

Her shift from enforcer to gardener feels earned through micro-choices (e.g., recognizing the fragment’s resonance, accepting the apple). The keeper serves as effective pressure without overshadowing Mira’s arc. Final renunciation of violence as identity carries visible cost: lighter shadows that are now “invitation,” not armor.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlene’s interiority is richly embodied and contradictory—she seeks death yet clings to sensation via the parasol tip; her “loose grip on reality” manifests as heightened perception, not abstraction. Her micro-choices (volunteering for ice-watch, tucking away the parasol like a rosary) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she trades closure for witness. The old Inuit woman mirrors her grandmother without flattening into archetype, deepening Marlene’s emotional arc through silent recognition rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marcus’s interiority is richly embodied—his grief, restraint, and quiet wisdom emerge through tactile memory (the burned letter) and agricultural metaphor. His micro-choice to stay and tend the vines despite heartbreak reveals a hierarchy of values with lifelong cost.

    The half-masked line walker’s interiority is concrete and consistent, with micro-choices—like removing her mask at dawn—that reveal hierarchy of values and carry visible cost. Her motivation to preserve wisdom echoes is rooted in lived experience, not abstraction. However, secondary characters like Marcus lack depth beyond functional pressure, and the prophet’s role borders on archetypal without individualizing contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Elena’s reticence and scholarly obsession are embodied through precise actions—fogging glass, pocketing the crystal, documenting poetic neologisms—rather than abstract labels. Her internal contradiction (devotion to dead words vs. witnessing living language) fuels credible endurance without tidy resolution. The final choice—to testify in fractured sequences—feels earned by her established perceptual habits. No diagnostic self-awareness mars peak moments; emotion arises through tactile detail (“edges warm against her palm”).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ezra’s precognitive amnesia is not a gimmick but the engine of his interior contradiction—simultaneously knowing and forgetting, guiding yet bewildered. His micro-choices (writing prophecies he won’t recall, arranging driftwood) reveal a hierarchy of values centered on service over self-knowledge. The woman’s arrival tests his endurance, not his agency, and his quiet collaboration earns a Charged Poise that forecloses control with profound cost: he remains forever outside his own foresight. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion is embodied in chalk dust, static, and fog.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ezra’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her tactile relationship with tools, her recognition of the “luminous ache,” and her rejection of escape in favor of repair all stem from consistent traits.

    Lyra’s motivation is rooted in precise observation and scholarly discipline, not generic curiosity. Her internal conflict—between inherited duty and emergent understanding—is embodied in micro-choices (e.g., tracing runes mid-crisis) rather than summarized.

No diagnostic label-speak; epiphanies arise from concrete interaction with the automaton and shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)

The final renunciation of the lighthouse’s flame-based guidance in favor of shared, gentle light feels earned through consistent character logic. Only minor flattening occurs in Tomás’s role, but it doesn’t undermine Marina’s credible arc.

Her flaw—trying to collect hope as artifact—is credibly confronted in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Elara’s motivation—restoring ritual through memory and song—is rooted in consistent traits (tinkerer, storyteller) and intensifies credibly. Her interiority is concrete (“fingers glowing faintly,” “voice cracked with emotion”) and avoids diagnostic label-speak.

Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, emotion emerges through tactile engagement with quartz, brass, and light. The final renunciation—leaving the mechanism broken yet documented—is earned by every prior action and carries the quiet cost of deferred closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her grief, discipline, and paradoxical freedom pulse through tactile details like the lamp’s seventeen grams and the whalebone fractal. Her micro-choices (orienting her head, touching the burner) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in loss and pattern. The contradiction between being “boundary-lessly trapped” yet absolutely free crystallizes in her earned stasis: she chooses containment to preserve meaning. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through geometry, weight, and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)

No diagnostic labels; emotion arises through grain, steam, rain.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kira’s interiority is richly embodied: her weathered fingers, the weight of her collection bag, and the tactile handling of the camera wheel ground her emotional conflict in physicality. Her contradictory impulses—scavenger versus architect, surrender versus preservation—act simultaneously, not as alternating summaries. The ghost functions as a credible projection of self-judgment, not a plot device, and Kira’s final renunciation (“the world built itself without us”) is earned through accumulated fragments, not declared.

    Maya’s motivation—solving impossible equations through functional creativity—is vividly embodied in her tactile engagement with valves, pipes, and the sextant fragment. Her internal drive (“equations for hope”) feels earned, not abstract, and her micro-choices (redirecting flows, transcribing emergent formulas) reveal a hierarchy of values: curiosity over safety, legacy over spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered through embodied contradiction: her damaged hands ache with musical memory while her present role demands silence. Her micro-choice—to split time between sanctuary and Conservatory—feels earned by two decades of accumulated loss and adaptation. The head priest’s earlier wisdom reframes, rather than resolves, her trauma, avoiding epiphanic neatness. Final decision carries visible cost: she accepts a bifurcated life, never fully returning to music nor fully abandoning it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mara’s interiority is concrete and conflicted—her global quest masks a personal evasion, and her realization emerges from embodied action (handling the sundial) rather than abstract insight. The parallel between Van der Meer’s confession and her father’s deceptions creates layered motivation without diagnostic self-awareness. Her final decision to return home forecloses further escape with clear emotional cost. The micro-choice to open the hidden compartment—and later pocket the sundial—reveals a hierarchy of values shifting in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s motivation—preserving vanishing knowledge—is embodied through tactile engagement with rope and fulgurite, not abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief manifests through tactile ritual (thread-pulling), projection, and obituary-writing, not diagnostic labels. Her motivation—to map loss as healing—is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices: winding the thread, projecting into Marcus’s observatory, planning to visit the weavers. The final renunciation isn’t of hope but of closure itself; she accepts endless documentation as purpose. Contradictory impulses coexist: she mourns the city yet finds “lonesome splendor” in its decay.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aldric’s motivation—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is consistent and embodied through his gaunt frame, scavenged apparatus, and tear-synthesized nutrients. His internal contradiction (hope vs. exhaustion) manifests physically and emotionally without therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Keeper’s interiority is vividly embodied through ethereal yet precise sensory language (“translucent form catching starlight like dew on spider silk”) and sustained emotional contradiction—mourning stellar deaths while celebrating rebirth.

The final renunciation—accepting eternal witness as both burden and privilege—is earned by prior causality and carries profound conceptual cost. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Martha’s interiority is concrete and contradictory—her grief is both personal and communal, her craft both solitary and connective.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)

Chen’s hesitation and eventual alignment add relational pressure without diluting Amira’s agency. However, the final renunciation (“We return it”) lacks a visible personal cost beyond implied risk, slightly undercutting Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)

His flaw (manufacturing lies to ease pain) directly shapes both past actions and present reckoning. The cost of his choice—destroying his livelihood and legacy—is visible and irreversible.

    Elara’s interiority is richly embodied—her grief, restraint, and moral calculus manifest through tactile interaction with the drawer pull and precise micro-choices (e.g., withholding forgiveness until after the exchange). Thorne’s arc is credibly compressed yet resonant; his apology emerges as earned exhaustion, not contrivance. Their parallel losses deepen without sentimentality, and the “uncommonly thoughtful” trait actively constrains Elara’s refusal of vengeance. The final renunciation (“forgiveness will come after”) forecloses immediate emotional resolution with palpable cost.

    Marcus’s interiority is vividly embodied—his shame, grief, and tentative hope manifest through tactile interactions (compass, poles, kayak) rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (paddling to pole 19, offering to teach) feel earned by prior causality. Sarah’s presence applies gentle but credible pressure without veering into therapist archetype. The final renunciation of celestial navigation in favor of utility poles forecloses a path with visible emotional cost.

    Marcus’s guilt without memory is embodied with precision—his tender ports, his hesitation on the bridge—and his final step forward reveals a hierarchy of values (empathy over absolution) with visible cost. The old woman’s “delicately robust” presence avoids archetype through idiosyncratic detail (pressed flowers, impossible baseball). Interior contradiction thrums in every line: he seeks forgiveness yet knows he shouldn’t receive it. His choice to walk the labyrinth is earned by prior causality and forecloses retreat.

    Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—her trembling hands contradict her steady voice, and her paradoxical certainty/terror fuels the central choice. Her motivation (reuniting with Kess beyond death) is consistent, deeply personal, and intensifies under pressure. The transformation isn’t a tidy epiphany but a costly dissolution earned by prior sacrifice (memories, gold, self). Her final state as a bridge between realms carries visible emotional and existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Elara’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory impulses (guilt vs. devotion, absorption vs. presence) act simultaneously in scene, not as summaries. Her micro-choices (painting with hair-brushes, aligning hands with moon phases) reveal a hierarchy of values with tangible cost. The final renunciation—not erasing guilt but unbinding its shadow over her daughter—is earned through consistent causality and embodied emotion. No diagnostic label-speak; even peak grief is filtered through tactile detail (“throat closed around words sharp as card edges”).

    Mei’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—her fluctuating weight, tactile engagement with grief, and micro-choices (e.g., uncapping the vial only after locating the correct photograph) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her pacifism isn’t abstract but tested against visceral horror (“whispers, screams, the sound of every blow”), yet she holds steady through intention, not dogma. The final transformation feels earned because her compassion is active, not passive—a renunciation of purity in favor of integration. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through concrete perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s motivation—understanding transformation through radical giving—is consistent, embodied, and intensifies to a renunciation that forecloses her human form. Her interiority avoids diagnostic labels; instead, tactile sensations (“gritty smoothness of change”) and micro-choices (opening bottles one by one) reveal her hierarchy of values. The old woman’s prophecy functions as a through-line, not an epiphany, and Elara’s final transformation feels earned by decades of unstated but implied sacrifice. Flawlessly integrates backstory via present stimuli without flattening pressure.

    Thorne and Amara reveal layered motives through micro-choices—Thorne’s precise alignment of the quill holder, Amara’s hand on her sword—that embody their shared risk without over-explaining. Their internal contradictions (duty vs. rebellion) manifest physically, not as diagnostic labels. The final exchange crystallizes mutual understanding without sentimentality. Minor deduction: Amara’s shift lacks a visible prior crack in loyalty, slightly softening her turn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Yann’s interiority is richly embodied—her precognitive curse manifests as lived tension between prophecy and action, not abstract angst. Her micro-choices (placing stones, scattering dust) reveal a hierarchy of values shaped by ancestral duty and cosmic curiosity. The final decision to create a new pattern for a future apprentice feels earned, with the cost of isolation and eternal vigilance legible in her solitude. No diagnostic label-speak; emotion arises through tactile ritual and luminous imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Maya’s interiority is exquisitely rendered—contradictory impulses (fury and calm, defiance and discipline) coexist in embodied choices like handling the timer or sealing poems behind bus timetables. Her motivation stems from a coherent arc of silencing to subversive creation, with micro-choices revealing a hierarchy of values: truth over safety, art over visibility. The “furiously tranquil” state isn’t labeled but enacted through breath control amid lightning strikes. Her flaws—stubborn idealism, isolation—are not hedged; they enable her resistance but also trap her in exile, making her endurance feel costly and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Marlowe’s contradictory impulses—intellectual audacity vs. physical vulnerability—are embodied through her mechanical arm and past trauma, driving micro-choices like tracing the needle card or interrupting Reeves. Her flaw (overvaluing inquiry over certainty) directly shapes tactics and stakes. The cost of her lost arm is felt, not just stated, and informs her present alliance. Final renunciation of traditional victory feels earned by causality rooted in character.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    October’s contradictory impulses—multiplying identity to resist uniformity while anchoring in a consistent core—are embodied through precise micro-choices (e.g., selecting which salvaged pages to bind, planning November’s role). Her molting isn’t evasion but tactical reinvention, with visible cost: isolation, illegibility, constant impermanence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; emotions emerge through tactile acts (pressing water-stained Rumi beside Dickinson) and charged objects (the coffee tin). Marcus’s reflection (“prism” metaphor) deepens her motive without over-explaining, and her final smile carries earned poise, not sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Marion’s interiority is concrete, contradictory, and embodied—her “strategically creative” hope manifests in tangible action (studying film reels, improvising music), not abstraction. Her final choice to improvise an “unplanned encore” emerges organically from established behavior and stakes. Sophia’s brief presence avoids sentimentality; their reunion carries the weight of temporal displacement without over-explanation. The cost—two years of solitary vigil—is felt in every gesture, especially the trembling fingers and the clock’s single-minute lurch.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Mira’s interiority is vividly embodied—her doubt, grief, and epiphany arise from sensory immersion in others’ memories, not exposition. Her final choice to classify the island as “Quantum Folklore” is earned through her lived experience of contradictory truths, not abstract reasoning. The cost—defying institutional norms—is felt in her awareness of Council challenge. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions emerge through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kenji’s interiority is exquisitely embodied—his grief manifests in tactile attention to lace, compass, and juniper rather than diagnostic labels. His micro-choices (teaching pruning, folding the lace, handing over the compass) reveal a hierarchy of values: reconciliation over pride, transmission over silence. The student functions as a credible pressure point, not a prop, forcing Kenji to externalize what he’s internalized for a year. His final decision to write tomorrow feels earned because his restraint today is active, not passive.
